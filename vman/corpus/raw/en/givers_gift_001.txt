there is often something pathetic about a great gift the only son of leland stanford dies and the millions which he would have inherited are used to found a noble institution on the pacific coast the only son of henry f durant the noted boston lawyer dies and the sorrowing father and mother use their fortune to build beautiful wellesley college the only son of amasa stone is drowned while at yale college and his father builds adelbert college of western reserve university to honor his boy and bless his city and state john lowell jr early bereft of his wife and two daughters his only children builds a lasting monument for himself in his free lectures for the people for all time he lowell institute of boston john lowell jr was born in boston mass may of distinguished ancestry his greatrandfather the rev john lowell was the first minister of newburyport his grandfather judge john lowell was one of the framers of the massachusetts constitution in he inserted in the bill of rights the clause declaring that all men are born free and equal for the purpose as he said of abolishing slavery in massachusetts and offered his services to any slave who desired to establish his right to freedom under that clause his position was declared to be constitutional by the supreme court of the state in since which time slavery has had no legal existence in massachusetts in he was elected a member of the continental congress and appointed by president washington a judge of the district court of massachusetts in president adams appointed him chief justice of the circuit court he was brilliant in conversation an able scholar and an honest and patriotic leader he was for eighteen years a member of the corporation of harvard college judge lowell had three sons john francis cabot and charles john a lawyer was prominent in all good work such as the establishment of the massachusetts general hospital the provident institution for savings in the city of boston the massachusetts agricultural society and other helpful projects he considered wealth said edward everett to be no otherwise valuable but as a powerful instrument of doing good his liberality went to the extent of his means and where they stopped he exercised an almost unlimited control over the means of others it was difficult to resist the contagion of his enthusiasm for it was the enthusiasm of a strong cultivated and practical mind illustration john lowell jr from the lowell institute by harriette knight smith published by lamson wolffe co boston francis cabot the second son was the father of the noted giver john lowell jr charles the third son became an eminent boston minister and was the father of the poet james russell lowell on his mother side the ancestors of john lowell jr were also prominent his maternal grandfather jonathan jackson was a generous man of means a member of the congress of and at the close of the revolutionary war largely the creditor of the commonwealth of massachusetts he was the treasurer of the state and of cambridge university john lowell jr must have inherited from such ancestors a love of country a desire for knowledge and good executive ability he was reared in a home of comfort and intelligence his father francis cabot was a successful merchant a man of great energy strength of mind and integrity of character in when young john was about eleven years old the health of his father having become impaired the lowell family went to england for rest and change the boy was placed at the high school of edinburgh where he won many friends by his lovable qualities and his intense desire to gain information when he came back to america with his parents he entered harvard college in when he was fourteen years old he was a great reader especially along the line of foreign travel and had a better knowledge of geography than most men after two years at cambridge he was obliged to give up the course from ill health and seek a more active live when he was seventeen and the year following he made two voyages to india and acquired a passion for study and travel in the east his father meantime had become deeply interested in the manufacture of cotton in america the war of had interrupted our commerce with europe and america had been compelled to manufacture many things for herself in mr samuel slater had brought from england the knowledge of the inventions of arkwright for spinning cotton these inventions were so carefully guarded from the public that it was almost impossible for any one to leave england who had worked in a cottonill and understood the process of manufacture parliament had prohibited the exportation of the new machinery without the knowledge of his parents samuel slater sailed to america carrying the complicated machinery in his mind at pawtucket r i he set up some arkwright machinery from memory and after years of effort and obstacles became successful and wealthy mr lowell determined to weave cotton and if possible use the thread already made in this country he proposed to his brothernaw mr patrick tracy jackson that they put some money into experiments and try to make a poweroom as this newly invented machine could not be obtained from abroad they procured the model of a common loom and after repeated failures succeeded in reinventing a fairly good poweroom the thread obtained from other mills not proving available for their looms spinning machinery was constructed and land was purchased on the merrimac river for their mills in time a large manufacturing city gathered about them and was named lowell for the energetic and upright manufacturer when the war of was over mr lowell knew that the overloaded markets of europe and india would pour their cotton and other goods into the united states he therefore went to washington in the winter of and after overcoming much opposition obtained a protective tariff for cotton manufacture the minimum duty on cotton fabrics says edward everett the cornertone of the system was proposed by mr lowell and is believed to have been an original conception on his part to this provision of law the fruit of the intelligence and influence of mr lowell new england owes that branch of industry which has made her amends for the diminution of her foreign trade which has left her prosperous under the exhausting drain of her population to the west which has brought a market for his agricultural produce to the farmer door and which while it has conferred these blessings on this part of the country has been productive of good and nothing but good to every other portion of it at mr lowell death he left a large fortune to his four children three sons and a daughter of whom john lowell jr was the eldest like his father john was a successful merchant but as his business was carried on largely with the east indies he had leisure for reading he had one of the best private libraries in boston and knew the contents of his books he did not forget his duties to his city he was several times a member of the common council and the legislature of the state believing that no person has a right to shirk political responsibility in the midst of this happy and useful life surrounded by those who were dear to him in the years and when he was thirtywo years of age came the crushing blow to his domestic joy his wife and both children died and his home was broken up he sought relief in travel and in the summer of made a tour of the western states in the autumn of the same year november he sailed for europe intending to be absent for some months or even years as though he had a premonition that his life would be a brief one and that he might never return he made his will before leaving america giving about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars alf of his property to found and sustain free lectures for the promotion of the moral and intellectual and physical instruction or education of the citizens of boston the will provides for courses in physics chemistry botany zo logy mineralogy the literature of our own and foreign nations and historical and internal evidences in favor of christianity the management of the whole fund with the selection of lecturers is left to one trustee who shall choose his successor that trustee to be in preference to all others some male descendant of my grandfather john lowell provided there be one who is competent to hold the office of trustee and of the name of lowell the trustees of the boston athen um are empowered to look over the accounts each year but have no voice in the selection of the lecturers the trustee says mr lowell in his will may also from time to time establish lectures on any subject that in his opinion the wants and taste of the age may demand none of the money given by will is ever to be used in buildings mr lowell probably having seen that money is too often put into brick and stone to perpetuate the name of the donor while there is no income for the real work in hand ten per cent of the income of the lowell fund is to be added annually to the principal it is believed that through wise investing the fund is already doubled and perhaps trebled the idea of a foundation of this kind says edward everett on which unconnected with any place of education provision is made in the midst of a large commercial population for annual courses of instruction by public lectures to be delivered gratuitously to all who choose to attend them as far as it is practicable within our largest halls is i believe original with mr lowell i am not aware that among all the munificent establishments of europe there is anything of this description upon a large scale after mr lowell reached europe in the fall of he spent the winter in paris and the summer in england scotland and ireland he was all the time preparing for his eastern journey n the study of languages and the knowledge of instruments by which to make notes of the course of winds the temperature atmospheric phenomena the height of mountains and other matters of interest in the farff lands which he hoped to enter lord glenelg the secretary of state for the colonies gave him special facilities for his proposed tour into the interior of india the winter of was spent in the southwestern part of france in visiting the principal cities of lombardy in nice and genoa reaching florence early in february in rome he engaged a swiss artist an excellent draftsman and painter to accompany him and make sketches of scenery ruins and costumes throughout his whole journey after some time spent in naples and vicinity he devoted a month to the island of sicily he writes to princess galitzin the granddaughter of the famous marshal suvorof whom he had met in florence clear and beautiful are the skies in sicily and there is a warmth of tint about the sunsets unrivalled even in italy it resembles what one finds under the tropics and so does the vegetation it is rich and luxuriant the palm begins to appear the palmetto the aloe and the cactus adorn every woodside the superb oleander bathes its roots in almost every brook the pomegranate and a large species of convolvulus are everywhere seen in short the variety of flowers is greater than that of the prairies in the western states of america though i think their number is less our rudbeckia is i think more beautiful than the chrysanthemum coronarium which you see all over sicily but there are the orange and the lemon mr lowell travelled in greece and july reached athens that venerable ruined dirty little town he wrote of which the streets are most narrow and nearly impassable but the poor remains of whose ancient taste in the arts exceed in beauty everything i have yet seen in either italy sicily or any other portions of greece late in september mr lowell reached smyrna and visited the ruins of magnesia tralles nysa laodicea tripolis and hierapolis he writes to a friend in america i then crossed mount messogis in the rain and descended into the basin of the river hermus visited philadelphia the picturesque site of sardis with its inaccessible citadel and two solitary but beautiful ionic columns early in december mr lowell sailed from smyrna in a greek brig coasting along the islands of mitylene samos patmos and rhodes arrived in alexandria in the latter part of the month and proceeded up the river nile on feb he writes to his friends from the top of the great pyramid the prospect is most beautiful on the one side is the boundless desert varied only by a few low ridges of limestone hills then you have heaps of sand and a surface of sand reduced to so fine a powder and so easily agitated by the slightest breeze that it almost deserves the name of fluid then comes the rich verdant valley of the nile studded with villages adorned with green daterees traversed by the father of rivers with the magnificent city of cairo on its banks but far narrower than one could wish as it is bounded at a distance of some fifteen miles by the arabian desert and the abrupt calcareous ridge of mokattam immediately below the spectator lies the city of the dead the innumerable tombs the smaller pyramids the sphinx and still farther off and on the same line to the south the pyramids of abou seer sakk r and dashoor while journeying in egypt mr lowell from the effects of the climate was severely attacked by intermittent fever but partially recovering proceeded to thebes and established his temporary home on the ruins of a palace at luxor after examining many of its wonderful structures carved with the names and deeds of the pharaohs he was again prostrated by illness and feared that he should not recover he had thought out more details about his noble gift to the people of boston and sick and among strangers he completed in that ancient land his last will for the good of humanity the few sentences says mr everett penned with a tired hand on the top of a palace of the pharaohs will do more for human improvement than for aught that appears was done by all of that gloomy dynasty that ever reigned mr lowell somewhat regained his health and proceeded to sioot the capital of upper egypt to lay in the stores needed for his journey to nubia while at sioot he saw the great caravan of darfour in central africa which comes to the nile once in two years and is two or three months in crossing the desert it usually consists of about six hundred merchants four thousand slaves and six thousand camels laden with ivory tamarinds ostricheathers and provisions for use on the journey mr lowell writes in his journal the immense number of tall and lank but powerful camels was the first object that attracted our attention in the caravan the long and painful journey besides killing perhaps a quarter of the original number had reduced the remainder to the condition of skeletons and rendered their natural ugliness still more appalling their skins were stretched like moistened parchment scorched by the fire over their strong ribs their eyes stood out from their shrunken foreheads and the arched backbone of the animals rose sharp and prominent above their sides like a butcher cleaver the fat that usually accompanies the middle of the backbone and forms with it the camel bunch had entirely disappeared they had occasion for it as well as for the reservoir of water with which a bountiful nature has furnished them to enable them to undergo the laborious journey and the painful fasts of the desert their sides were gored with the heavy burdens they had carried the sun was setting the little slaves of the caravan had just driven in from their dry pasture of thistles parched grass and withered herbage these most patient and obedient animals so essential to travellers in the great deserts and without which it would be as impossible to cross them as to traverse the ocean without vessels their conductors made them kneel down and gradually poured beans between their lengthened jaws the camels not having been used to this food did not like it they would have greatly preferred a bit of old wornut mat as we have found to our cost in the desert the most mournful cries something between the braying of an ass and the lowing of a cow assailed our ears in all directions because these poor creatures were obliged to eat what was not good for them but they offered no resistance otherwise when transported to the nile it is said that the change of food and water kills most of them in a little time in june mr lowell resumed his journey up the nile and was again ill for some weeks the thermometer frequently stood at degrees he visited khartoom and then travelled for fourteen days across the desert of nubia to sowakeen a small port on the western coast of the red sea near here dec he was shipwrecked on the island of dass and nearly lost his life in a rainstorm the little vessel ran upon the rocks all my people behaved well mr lowell writes yanni alone the youngest of them showed by a few occasional exclamations that it is hard to look death in the face at seventeen when all the illusions of life are entire as for swimming i have not strength for that especially in my clothes and so thorough a ducking and exposure might of itself make an end of me finally they were rescued and sailed for mocha reaching that place on the st of january mr lowell was much exhausted from exposure and his recent illness his last letters were written jan at mocha while waiting for a british steamer on her way to bombay india from mr lowell journal it is seen that the steamboat hugh lindsay arrived at mocha from suez jan that mr lowell sailed on the and arrived at bombay feb he had reached the east only to die after three weeks of illness he expired march a little less than thirtyeven years of age for years he had studied about india and china and had made himself ready for valuable research but his plans were changed by an overruling power in whom he had always trusted mr lowell had wisely provided for a greater work than research in the east the benefits of which are inestimable and unending free public lectures for the people of boston on the lowell foundation were begun on the evening of dec by a memorial address on mr lowell by edward everett in the odeon then at the corner of federal and franklin streets before two thousand persons the first course of lectures was on geology given by that able scientist professor benjamin silliman of yale college so great was his popularity says harriette knight smith in the new england magazine for february that on the giving out of tickets for his second course on chemistry the following season the eager crowds filled the adjacent streets and crushed in the windows of the ld corner bookstore the place of distribution so that provision for the same had to be made elsewhere to such a degree did the enthusiasm of the public reach at that time in its desire to attend these lectures that it was found necessary to open books in advance to receive the names of subscribers the number of tickets being distributed by lot sometimes the number of applicants for a single course was eight or ten thousand the same number of the magazine contains a valuable list of all the speakers at the institute since its beginning the usual method now is to advertise the lectures in the boston papers a week or more in advance and then all persons desiring to attend meet at a designated place and receive tickets in the order of their coming at the appointed hour the doors of the building where the lectures are given are closed and no one is admitted after the speaker begins not long since i met a gentleman who had travelled seven miles to attend a lecture and failed to obtain entrance harriette knight smith says this rule was at first resisted to such a degree that a reputable gentleman was taken to the lockup and compelled to pay a fine for kicking his way through an entrance door finally the rule was submitted to and in time praised and copied for seven years the lowell institute lectures were given in the odeon and for thirteen years in marlboro chapel between washington and tremont winter and bromfield streets since they have been heard in huntington hall boylston street in the rogers building of the massachusetts institute of technology since the establishment of the free lectures over five thousand have been given to the people by some of the most eminent and learned men of both hemispheres yell tyndall wallace holmes lowell bryce and more than three hundred others sir charles lyell lectured on geology professor asa gray on botany oliver wendell holmes on english poetry of the nineteenth century e h davis on mounds and earthworks of the mississippi valley lieutenant f maury on winds and currents of the sea mark hopkins president of williams colleg on moral philosophy charles eliot norton on the thirteenth century henry barnard on national education samuel eliot on evidences of christianity burt g wilder on the silk spider of south carolina w howells on italian poets of our century professor john tyndall on light and heat dr isaac i hayes on arctic discoveries richard a proctor on astronomy general francis a walker on money hon carroll wright on the labor question h h boyesen on the icelandic saga literature the rev j g wood on structure of animal life the rev h r haweis on music and morals alfred russell wallace on darwinism and some of its applications the rev g frederick wright on the ice age in north america professor james geikie on europe during and after the ice age john fiske on the discovery and colonization of america professor henry drummond on the evolution of man president eliot of harvard college on recent educational changes and tendencies professor tyndall after his lowell lectures gave the ten thousand dollars which he had received for his labors in america in scholarships to the university of pennsylvania harvard university and columbia college mr john amory lowell a cousin of john lowell jr and the trustee appointed by him at the suggestion of lyell a mutual friend invited louis agassiz to come to boston and give a course of lectures before the institute in he came and the visit resulted in the building by mr abbott lawrence of the lawrence scientific school in connection with harvard college and the retaining of the brilliant and noble agassiz in this country as a professor of zo logy and geology the influence of such lectures upon the intellectual growth and moral welfare of a city can scarcely be estimated it is felt through the state and eventually through the nation mr lowell in his will planned also for other lectures those more erudite and particular for students and for twenty years there have been lowell free courses of instruction in the institute of technology given usually in the evening in the classrooms of the professors these are the same lectures usually given to regular students and are free alike to men and women over eighteen years of age these courses of instruction include mathematics mechanics physics drawing chemistry geology natural history navigation biology english french german history architecture and engineering through the generosity of mr lowell every person in boston may become educated if he or she have the time and desire over three thousand such lectures have been given for many years the lowell institute has furnished instruction in science to the schooleachers of boston it now furnishes lectures on practical and scientific subjects to workingmen under the auspices of the wells memorial workingmen institute as the university extension lectures carry the college to the people so more and more the lowell fund is carrying helpful and practical intelligence to every nook and corner of a great city young people are stimulated to endeavor encouraged to save time in which to gain knowledge and to become useful and honorable citizens when more settlements are established in all the waste places we shall have so many the more centres for the diffusion of intellectual and moral aid who shall estimate the power and value of such a gift to the people as that of john lowell jr the hon edward everett said truly it will be from generation to generation a perennial source of public good dispensation of sound science of useful knowledge of truth in its most important associations with the destiny of man these are blessings which cannot die they will abide when the sands of the desert shall have covered what they have hitherto spared of the egyptian temples and they will render the name of lowell in allise and moral estimation more truly illustrious than that of any pharaoh engraven on their walls the gift of john lowell jr has resulted in other good work besides the public lectures in a free drawingchool was established in marlboro chapel and continued successfully for twentyine years till the building was taken for business purposes the pupils were required to draw from real objects only through the whole course in the lowell school of practical design for the purpose of promoting industrial art in the united states was established and the massachusetts institute of technology assumed the responsibility of conducting it the lowell institute bears the expenses of the school and tuition is free to all pupils there is a drawingoom and a weavingoom though applicants must be able to draw from nature before they enter in the weavingoom are two fancy chainooms for dressoods three fancy chainooms for woollen cassimeres one gingham loom and one jacquard loom samples of brocaded silk ribbons alpacas and fancy woollen goods are constantly provided for the school from paris and elsewhere the course of study requires three years and students are taught the art of designing and making patterns from prints ginghams delaines silks laces paperangings carpets oilcloths etc they can also weave their designs into actual fabrics of commercial sizes of every variety of material the school has proved a most helpful and beneficent institution it is an inspiration to visit it and see the happy and earnest faces of the young workers fitting themselves for useful positions in life the lowell institute has been fortunate in its management mr john amory lowell was the able trustee for more than forty years and the present trustee mr augustus lowell like his father has the great work much at heart dr benjamin e cotting the curator from the formation of the institute a period of more than half a century has won universal esteem for his ability as also for his extreme courtesy and kindness john lowell jr humanly speaking died before his lifework was scarcely begun the studious modest boy the thorough conscientious man planning a journey to africa and india not for pleasure merely but for helpfulness to science and humanity died just as he entered the long soughtor land a man of warm affections he went out from a broken home to die among strangers he was so careful of his moments that says mr everett he spared no time for the frivolous pleasures of youth less perhaps than his health required for its innocent relaxations and for exercise whether or not he realized that the time was short he accomplished more in his brief thirtyeven years than many men in fourscore and ten it would have been easy to spend two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in houses and lands in fine equipage and social festivities but mr lowell had a higher purpose in life after five weeks of illness thousands of miles from all who were dear to him on the ruins of thebes in an arab village built on the remains of an ancient palace mr lowell penned these words as the most certain and the most important part of true philosophy appears to me to be that which shows the connection between god revelations and the knowledge of good and evil implanted by him in our nature i wish a course of lectures to be given on natural religion showing its conformity to that of our saviour for the more perfect demonstration of the truth of those moral and religious precepts by which alone as i believe men can be secure of happiness in this world and that to come i wish a course of lectures to be delivered on the historical and internal evidences in favor of christianity i wish all disputed points of faith and ceremony to be avoided and the attention of the lecturers to be directed to the moral doctrines of the gospel stating their opinion if they will but not engaging in controversy even on the subject of the penalty for disobedience as the prosperity of my native land new england which is sterile and unproductive must depend hereafter as it has heretofore depended first on the moral qualities and second on the intelligence and information of its inhabitants i am desirous of trying to contribute towards this second object also the friend of the people mr lowell desired that they should learn from the greatest minds of the age without expense to themselves it should be an absolutely free gift the words from the theban ruins have had their ever broadening influence through half a century what shall be the result for good many centuries from now tens of thousands of fortunes have been and will be spent for self and the names of the owners will be forgotten john lowell jr did not live for himself and his name will be remembered others in this country have adopted somewhat mr lowell plan of giving the hon oakes ames the great shovel manufacturer member of congress for ten years and builder of the union pacific railroad left at his death may a fund of fifty thousand dollars for the benefit of the school children of north easton mass the income is thirtyive hundred dollars a year part of which is used in furnishing magazines to children ach family having children in the schools is supplied with some magazine part for an industrial school where they are taught the use of tools and part for free lectures yearly to the school children adults also having the benefit of them thirty or more lectures are given each winter upon interesting and profitable subjects by able lecturers some of the subjects already discussed are as follows the great yellowstone park a journey among the planets the chemistry of a match paris its gardens and palaces a basket of charcoal tobacco and liquors battle of gettysburg the story of the jeannette palestine electricity picturesque mexico the sponge and starfish sweden physiology history of a steamngine heroes and historic places of the revolution the four napoleons the world fair the civil war and others what better way to spend an evening than in listening to such lectures what better way to use one money than in laying the foundation of intelligent and good citizenship in childhood and youth the press of north easton says the influence and educational power of such a series of lectures and course of instruction in a community cannot be measured or properly gauged from these lectures a stream of knowledge has gone out which we believe will bear fruit in the future for the good of the community of the many good things which have come from the liberality of mr ames this we believe has been the most potent for good of any judge white of lawrence mass left at his death a tract of land in the hands of three trustees which they were to sell and use the income to provide a course of not less than six lectures yearly especially to the industrial classes the subjects were to be along the line of good morals industry economy the fruits of sin and of virtue the white fund amounts to about one hundred thousand dollars mrs mary hemenway of boston who died march will always be remembered for her good works not the least of which are the yearly courses of free lectures for young people at the old south church when the meetingouse where benjamin franklin was baptized where the town meeting was held after the boston massacre in and just before the tea was thrown overboard in and which the british troops used for a ridingchool in hen this historic place was in danger of being torn down because business interests seemed to demand the location mrs hemenway with other boston women came forward in to save it she once said to mr larkin dunton head master of the boston normal school i have just given a hundred thousand dollars to save the old south yet i care nothing for the church on the corner lot but if i live such teaching shall be done in that old building and such an influence shall go out from it as shall make the children of future generations love their country so tenderly that there can never be another civil war in this country mrs hemenway was patriotic when asked why she gave one hundred thousand dollars to tileston normal school in wilmington n er maiden name was tileston nd thus provide for schools in the south she replied when my country called for her sons to defend the flag i had none to give mine was but a lad of twelve i gave my money as a thankffering that i was not called to suffer as other mothers who gave their sons and lost them i gave it that the children of this generation might be taught to love the flag their fathers tore down in december miss alice baker began at the old south church a series of talks to children on new england history between eleven and twelve olock on saturdays which she called the children hour from the relics on the floor and in the gallery telling of colonial times she riveted their attention thus showing to the historical societies of this country how easily they might interest and profit the children of our public schools if these were allowed to visit museums in small companies with suitable leaders from this year the excellent work has been carried on every year george washington birthday is appropriately celebrated at the old south meetingouse with speeches and singing of national patriotic airs by the children of the public schools in mr john fiske the noted historical writer gave a course of lectures on saturday mornings upon the discovery and colonization of america these were followed in succeeding years by his lectures on the american revolution and others that are now published in book form these were more especially for the young but adults seemed just as eager to hear them as young persons regular courses of free lectures for young people were established in the summer of more especially for those who did not leave the city during the long summer vacations the lectures are usually given on wednesday afternoons in july and august a central topic is chosen for the season such as early massachusetts history the war for the union the war for independence the birth of the nation the american indians etc and different persons take part in the course with each lecture a leaflet of four or eight pages is given to those who attend and these leaflets can be bound at the end of the season for a small sum these are made up for the most part from original papers treated in the lectures says mr edwin mead who prepares them in the hope to make the men and the public life of the periods more clear and real these leaflets are very valuable the subjects being the voyages to vinland from the saga of eric the red marco polo account of japan and java the death of de soto from the narrative of a gentleman of elvas etc they are furnished to the schools at the bare cost of paper and printing mr mead the scholarly author and editor of the new england magazine has been untiring in the old south work and has been the means of several other cities adopting like methods for the study of early history especially by young people every year since four prizes two of forty dollars and two of twentyive dollars each have been offered to high school pupils soon to graduate and also to those recently graduated for the best essays on assigned topics of american history those who compete and do not win a prize receive a present of valuable books in recognition of their effort from the first mrs hemenway was the enthusiastic friend and promoter of the old south work she spent five thousand a year for many years in carrying it forward and left provision for its continuation at her death it is not too much to say that these free lectures have stimulated the study of our early history all over the country and made us more earnest lovers of our flag and of our nation the world has little respect for a man without a country breathes there the man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said his is my own my native land whose heart hath ner within him burned as home his footsteps he hath turned from wandering on a foreign strand mrs hemenway did not cease her good work with her free lectures for young people it is scarcely easier to stop in an upward career than in a downward when the heart and hand are once opened to the world needs they can nevermore be closed mrs hemenway practical with all her wealth believed that everybody should know how to work and thus not only be placed above want but dignify labor she said in my youth girls in the best families were accustomed to participate in many of the household affairs some occasionally assisted in other homes as for myself i read not many books they were not so numerous as now i was reared principally on household duties the bible and shakespeare mrs hemenway began by establishing kitchen gardens in boston opened on saturdays i remember going to one of them at the north end in through the invitation of mrs hemenway able assistant miss amy morris homans in a large plain room of the mission i found twentyour bright little girls seated at two long tables they were eager interesting children but most had on torn and soiled dresses and poor shoes in front of each stood a tiny box used as a table on which were four plates each a little over an inch wide four knives each three inches long and forks to correspond goblets and cups and saucers of the same diminutive sizes at a signal from the piano the girls began to set the little tables properly first the knives and forks were put in their places then the very small napkins and then the goblets in front of the lady of the house were set the cups and saucers spoonolder wateritcher and coffeeot then they listened to a useful and pleasant talk from the leader and when the order was given to clear the tables twentyour pairs of little hands put the pewter dishes made to imitate silver into a pitcher and the other things into dishpans about four or five inches wide singing a song to the music of the piano as they washed the dishes these children also learned to sweep and dust make beds and perform other household duties each pupil was given a complete set of new clothes by mrs hemenway many persons had petitioned to have sewing taught in the public schools of boston as in london but there was opposition and but little was accomplished mrs hemenway started sewingchools obtained capable teachers and in time sewing became a regular part of the publicchool work with a department of sewing in the boston normal school so that hereafter the teacher will be as able in her department as another in mathematics drafting cutting and fitting have been added in many schools so that thousands of women will be able to save expense in their homes through the skill of their own hands mrs hemenway knew that in many homes food is poorly cooked and health is thereby impaired mr henry hardon of boston tells of this conversation between two teachers name some one thing that would enable your boys to achieve more and build up the school a plate of good soup and a thick slice of bread after recess was the reply i could get twice the work before twelve they want new blood mrs hemenway started cookingchools in boston which she called school kitchens and when it was found to be difficult to secure suitable teachers she established and supported a normal school of cooking boston seeing the need of proper teachers in its future work in the schools has provided a department of cooking in the city normal school mrs hemenway believed in strong bodies aided to become such by physical training she offered to the school committee of boston to provide for the instruction of a hundred teachers in the swedish system on condition that they be allowed to use the exercises in their classes in case they chose to do so the result proved successful and now over sixty thousand in the public schools take the swedish exercises daily mrs hemenway established the boston normal school of gymnastics from which teachers have gone to radcliffe college cambridge bryn mawr pennsylvania denver colorado drexel institute philadelphia their average salary being slightly less than one thousand dollars the highest salary reaching eighteen hundred dollars boston has now made the teaching of gymnastics a part of its normalchool work so that every graduate goes out prepared to direct the work in the school mrs hemenway gave generously to aid the boston teachers mutual benefit association for she said nothing is too good for the boston teachers she was a busy woman with no time for fashionable life though she welcomed to her elegant home all who had any helpful work to do in the world she used her wealth and her social position to help humanity she died leaving her impress on a great city and state and through that upon the nation new york state and city are now carrying out an admirable plan of free lectures for the people the state appropriates twentyive thousand dollars annually that free lectures may be given in natural history geography and kindred subjects by means of pictorial representation and lectures to the free common schools of each city and village of the state that has or may have a superintendent of free common schools these illustrated lectures may also be given to artisans mechanics and other citizens this has grown largely out of the excellent work done by professor albert s bickmore of the american museum of natural history eighth avenue and seventyeventh street central park new york in when the museum was founded the teachers of the public schools were required to give objectessons on animals plants human anatomy and physiology and came to the museum to the curator of the department of ethnology professor bickmore for assistance his lectures given on saturday forenoons illustrated by the stereopticon were upon the body he muscular system nervous system etc the mineral kingdom ranite marble coal petroleum iron etc the vegetable kingdom vergreens oaks elms etc the animal kingdom he sea corals oysters butterflies bees ants etc physical geography he mississippi valley yellowstone national park mexico egypt greece italy west indies etc zo logy ishes reptiles and birds the whale dogs seals lions monkeys etc these lectures became so popular and helpful that the trustees of the museum hired chickering hall for some of the courses which were attended by over thirteen hundred teachers each week professor bickmore also gives free illustrated lectures to the people on the afternoons of legal holidays at the museum under the auspices of the state department of public instruction new york state has done a thing which might well be copied in other states each normal school of the state and each city and village superintendent of schools may be provided with a stereopticon all needed lantern slides and the printed lectures of professor bickmore for use before the schools in this way children have objectessons which they never forget the museum in coperation with the board of education of the city of new york is providing free lectures for the people at the museum on saturday evenings by various lecturers the board under the direction of dr henry leipziger is doing good work in its free illustrated lectures for the people in many portions of the city these are given in the evenings and often at the grammarchool buildings a good use to which to put them such subjects are chosen as the navy in the civil war the progress of the telegraph life in the arctic regions emergencies and how to meet them by some physicia iron and steel shipuilding the care of the eyes and teeth burns and scotland andrew jackson etc rich and poor are alike welcome to the lectures and all classes are present a city or state that does such work for the people will reap a hundredold in coming generations stephen girard and his college for orphans near the city of bordeaux france on may the eldest son of pierre girard and his wife anne marie lafargue was born the family were welloo and pierre was knighted by louis for bravery on board the squadron at brest in when france and england were at war the king gave pierre girard his own sword which pierre at his death ordered to be placed in his coffin and it was buried with him although the girard family were devoted to the sea pierre wished to have his boys become professional men and this might have been the case with the eldest son stephen had not an accident changed his life when the boy was eight years old his right eye was destroyed some wet oysterhells were thrown upon a bonfire and the heat breaking the shells a ragged piece flew into the eye to make the calamity worse his playmates ridiculed his appearance with one eye closed and he became sensitive and disinclined to play with any one save his brother jean he was a grave and dignified lad inclined to be domineering and of a quick temper his mother tried to teach him selfontrol and had she lived would doubtless have softened his nature but a second mother coming into the home who had several children of her own the effect upon stephen was disastrous she seems not to have understood his nature and when he rebelled the father sided with the new love and bade his son submit or find a home as best he could i will leave your house replied the passionate boy hurt in feelings as well as angered give me a venture on any ship that sails from bordeaux and i will go at once where you shall never see me again a business acquaintance captain jean courteau was about to sail to san domingo in the west indies pierre girard gave his son sixteen thousand livres about three thousand dollars and the lad of fourteen small for his age went out into the world as a cabinoy to try his fortune if his mother had been alive he would have been homesick but as matters were at present the girard house could not be a home to him his first voyage lasted ten months the three thousand dollars had gained him some money and the trip had made him in love with the sea he returned for a brief time to his brothers and sisters and then made five other voyages having attained the rank of lieutenant of the vessel when he was twentyhree he was given authority to act as captain of a merchant vessel and sailed away from bordeaux forever after stopping at st marc in the island of san domingo young girard sailed for new york which he reached in july with shrewd business ability he disposed of the articles brought in his ship and in so doing attracted the interest of a prosperous merchant mr thomas randall who was engaged in trade with new orleans and the west indies mr randall asked the energetic young frenchman to take the position of first officer in his ship limable louise this resulted so satisfactorily that girard was taken into partnership and became master of the vessel in her trade with new orleans and the west indies after nearly two years in may girard was returning from the west indies and in a fog and storm at sea found himself in delaware bay and learned that a british fleet was outside the pilot who had come in answer to the small cannon fired from girard ship advised against his going to new york as he would surely be captured the revolutionary war having begun as he had no american money with him a philadelphia gentleman who came with the pilot loaned him five dollars this fiveollar loan proved a blessing to the quaker city when in after years she received millions from the merchant who came by accident into her borders captain girard sold his interest in limable louise and opened a small store on water street putting into it his cargo from the west indies he hoped to go to sea again as soon as the war should be over and conferred with mr lum a plain shipbuilder near him on water street about building a ship for him mr lum had an unusually beautiful daughter mary a girl of sixteen with black hair and eyes and very fair complexion though eleven years older than mary stephen girard fell in love with her and was married to her june before his family could object as they soon did strenuously when they learned that she was poor and below him in social rank about three years after the marriage jean visited his brother stephen in america and seems to have appreciated the beautiful and modest girl to whom the family were so opposed henry atlee ingram b in his life of girard quotes several letters from jean after he had returned to france or when at cape fran ois san domingo be so kind as to assure my dear sisternaw of my true affection say a thousand kind things to her for me and assure her of my unalterable friendship thousands and thousands of friendly wishes to your dear wife say to her that if anything from here would give her pleasure to ask me for it i will do everything in the world to prove to her my attachment i send by derussy the jar which your lovely wife filled for me with gherkins full of an excellent guava jelly for you people besides two orangerees he has promised me to take care of them i hope he will and embrace as well as you my ever dear mary three or four months after his marriage lord howe having threatened the city mr girard took his young wife to mount holly n j to a little farm of five or six acres which he had purchased the previous year for five hundred dollars here they lived in a onetoryndalf frame house for over a year when they returned to philadelphia and he resumed his business he had decided already to become a citizen of the republic and took the oath of allegiance oct mr lum at once began to build the sloop which mr girard was planning when he first met mary and she was named the wateritch until she was shipwrecked five or six years later mr girard believed she could never cause him loss already he was worth over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars made by his own energy prudence and ability but he lived with great simplicity and was accumulating wealth rapidly in he built his second vessel named in compliment to jean the two brothers the next year when he was thirtyive years old the great sorrow of his life came upon him the beautiful wife only a little beyond her teens became melancholy and then hopelessly insane mr ingram believes the eight years of mary girard married life were happy years though the contrary has been stated without doubt mr girard was very fond of her though his unbending will and temper and the ignoring of her relatives were not calculated to make any woman continuously happy evidently jean who had lived in the family thought no blame attached to his brother for he wrote from cape fran ois it is impossible to express to you what i felt at such news i do truly pity the frightful state i imagine you to be in above all knowing the regard and love you bear your wife conquer your grief and show yourself by that worthy of being a man for dear friend when one has nothing with which to reproach one self no blow whatsoever it may be should crush him after a period of rest mrs girard seemed to recover stephen and jean formed a partnership and the former sailed to the mediterranean on business for the firm after three years the partnership was dissolved by mutual consent stephen preferring to transact business alone as soon as these matters were settled he and his wife were to take a journey to france which country she had long been anxious to visit probably the family would then see for themselves that the unassuming girl made an amiable sensible wife for their eldest son in the midst of preparations the despondency again returned and by the advice of physicians mrs girard was taken to the pennsylvania hospital at eighth and spruce streets aug where she remained till her death in insane for over twentyive years she retained much of the beauty of her girlhood lived on the first floor of the hospital in large rooms had the freedom of the grounds and was always sitting in the sunlight her mind became almost a blank and when the housekeeper came bringing the little daughters of jean mrs girard scarcely recognized her to add still more to mr girard sorrow after his wife had been at the hospital several months on march a daughter was born to her who was named for the mother mary girard the infant was taken into the country to be cared for and lived but a few months it was buried in the graveyard of the parish church bereft of his only child his home desolate mr girard plunged more than ever into the whirl of business he built six large ships naming some of them after his favorite authors oltaire helvetius montesquieu rousseau good friends and north america o trade with china and india and other eastern countries he would send grain and cotton to bordeaux where after unloading his ships would reload with fruit and wine for st petersburg there they would dispose of their cargo and take on hemp and iron for amsterdam from there they would go to calcutta and canton and return laden with tea and silks to philadelphia little was known about the quiet taciturn frenchman but every one supposed he was becoming very rich which was the truth he was not always successful he says in one of his letters we are all the subjects of what you call everses of fortune the great secret is to make good use of fortune and when reverses come receive them with sang froid and by redoubled activity and economy endeavor to repair them his ship montesquieu from canton china arrived within the capes of delaware march not having heard of the war between america and england and was captured with her valuable cargo the fruits of the two years voyage the ship was valued at and the cargo over he immediately tried to ransom her and did so with in coin when her cargo was sold the sales amounted to nearly so that girard quickness and good sense in spite of the ransom brought him large gains the teas were sold for over two dollars a pound on account of their scarcity from the war mr girard rose early and worked late he spent little on clothes or for daily needs he evidently did not care simply to make money for he wrote his friend duplessis at new orleans i do not value fortune the love of labor is my highest ambition i observe with pleasure that you have a numerous family that you are happy in the possession of an honest fortune this is all that a wise man has a right to wish for as to myself i live like a galleylave constantly occupied and often passing the night without sleeping i am wrapped up in a labyrinth of affairs and worn out with care to another he wrote when i rise in the morning my only effort is to labor so hard during the day that when the night comes i may be enabled to sleep soundly he had the same strong will as in his boyhood but he usually controlled his temper he kept his business to himself and would not permit his clerks to gossip about his affairs they had to be men of correct habits while in his employ having some suspicion of one of the officers of his ship voltaire he wrote to captain bowen i desire you not to permit a drunken or immoral man to remain on board of your ship whenever such a man makes disturbance or is disagreeable to the rest of the crew discharge him whenever you have the opportunity and if any of my apprentices should not conduct themselves properly i authorize you to correct them as i would myself my intention being that they shall learn their business so after they are free they may be useful to themselves and their country mr girard gave minute instructions to all his employees with the direction that they were to break owners not orders miss louise stockton in a sylvan city or quaint corners in philadelphia tells the following incident illustrative of mr girard inflexible rule he once sent a young supercargo with two ships on a two years voyage he was to go first to london then to amsterdam and so from port to port selling and buying until at last he was to go to mocha buy coffee and turn back at london however the young fellow was charged by the barings not to go to mocha or he would fall into the hands of pirates at amsterdam they told him the same thing everywhere the caution was repeated but he sailed on until he came to the last port before mocha here he was consigned to a merchant who had been an apprentice to girard in philadelphia and he too told him he must not dare venture near the red sea the supercargo was now in a dilemma on one side was his master order on the other two vessels a valuable cargo and a large sum of money the merchant knew girard peculiarities as well as the supercargo did but he thought the rule to break owners not orders might this time be governed by discretion oul not only lose all you have made he said ut youl never go home to justify yourself the young man reflected after all the object of his voyages was to get coffee and there was no danger in going to java so he turned his prow and away he sailed to the chinese seas he bought coffee at four dollars a sack and sold it in amsterdam at a most enormous advance and then went back to philadelphia in good order with large profits sure of approval soon after he entered the countingoom girard came in he looked at the young fellow from under his bushy brows and his one eye gleamed with resentment he did not greet him nor welcome him nor congratulate him but shaking his angry hand cried hat for you not go to mocha sir and for the moment the supercargo wished he had but this was all girard ever said on the subject he rarely scolded his employees he might express his opinion by cutting down a salary and when a man did not suit him he dismissed him when one of girard bookkeepers stephen simpson apparently with little or no provocation assaulted a fellow bookkeeper injuring him so severely about the head that the man was unable to leave his home for more than a week girard simply laid a letter on simpson desk the next morning reducing his salary from fifteen hundred dollars to one thousand per annum the clerk was very angry but did not give up his situation when an errandoy was caught in the act of stealing small sums of money from the countingouse mr girard put a more intricate lock on the moneyrawer and made no comment the boy was sorry for his conduct and gave no further occasion for complaint girard believed in labor as a necessity for every human being he used to say no man shall be a gentleman on my money if he had a son he should labor he said if i should leave him twenty thousand dollars he would be lazy or turn gambler mr ingram tells an amusing incident of an irishman who applied to mr girard for work engaging the man for a whole day he directed the removal from one side of his yard to the other of a pile of bricks which had been stored there awaiting some building operations and this task which consumed several hours being completed he was accosted by the irishman to know what should be done next hy have you finished that already said girard thought it would take all day to do that well just move them all back again where you took them from that will use up the rest of the day and upon the astonished irishman flat refusal to perform such fruitless labor he was promptly paid and discharged girard saying at the same time in a rather aggrieved manner certainly understood you to say that you wanted any kind of work absorbed as mr girard was in his business cold and unapproachable as he seemed to the people of philadelphia he had noble qualities which showed themselves in the hour of need in the latter part of july yellow fever in its most fatal form broke out in water street within a square of mr girard residence the city was soon in a panic most of the public offices were closed the churches were shut up and people fled from the city whenever it was possible to do so corpses were taken to the grave on the shafts of a chaise driven by a negro unattended and without ceremony many never walked in the footpath but went in the middle of the streets to avoid being infected in passing houses wherein people had died acquaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets and only signified their regard by a cold nod the old custom of shaking hands fell into such disuse that many shrank back with affright at even the offer of a hand the deathalls echoed through the silent grassrown streets and at night the watcher would hear at his neighbor door the cry ring out your dead and the dead were brought unwept over unprayed for they were wrapped in the sheet in which they died and were hurried into a box and thrown into a great pit the rich and the poor together authentic cases are recorded says henry w arey in his girard college and its founder where parent and child and husband and wife died deserted and alone for want of a little care from the hands of absent kindred in the midst of this dreadful plague an anonymous call for volunteer aid appeared in the federal gazette the only paper which continued to be published all but three of the visitors of the poor had died or had fled from the city the hospital at bush hill needed some one to bring order out of chaos and cleanliness out of filth two men volunteered to do this work which meant probable death to the amazement of all one of these was the rich and reticent foreigner stephen girard the other man was peter helm the former took the interior of the hospital under his charge for two months mr girard spent from six to eight hours daily in the hospital and the rest of the time helped to remove the sick and the dead from the infected districts round about he wrote to a friend in baltimore the deplorable situations to which fright and sickness have reduced the inhabitants of our city demand succor from those who do not fear death or who at least do not see any risk in the epidemic which now prevails here this will occupy me for some time and if i have the misfortune to succumb i will have at least the satisfaction to have performed a duty which we all owe to each other mr ingram quotes from the united states gazette of jan the account of girard at this time witnessed by a merchant who was hurrying by with a camphoraturated handkerchief pressed to his mouth a carriage rapidly driven by a black servant broke the silence of the deserted and grassrown street it stopped before a frame house in farmer row the very hotbed of the pestilence and the driver first having bound a handkerchief over his mouth opened the door of the carriage and quickly remounted to the box a short thicket man stepped from the coach and entered the house in a minute or two the observer who stood at a safe distance watching the proceedings heard a shuffling noise in the entry and soon saw the visitor emerge supporting with extreme difficulty a tall gaunt yellowisaged victim of the pestilence his arm was around the waist of the sick man whose yellow face rested against his own his long damp tangled hair mingling with his benefactor his feet dragging helpless upon the pavement thus partly dragging partly lifted he was drawn to the carriage door the driver averting his face from the spectacle far from offering to assist after a long and severe exertion the well man succeeded in getting the fevertricken patient into the vehicle and then entering it himself the door was closed and the carriage drove away to the hospital the merchant having recognized in the man who thus risked his life for another the foreigner stephen girard twice after this in and when the yellow fever again appeared in philadelphia mr girard gave his time and money to the sick and the poor in january he wrote to a friend in france during all this frightful time i have constantly remained in the city and without neglecting my public duties i have played a part which will make you smile would you believe it my friend that i have visited as many as fifteen sick people in one day and what will surprise you still more i have lost only one patient an irishman who would drink a little busy as a mariner merchant and helper of the sick and the poor mr girard found time to aid the republic to which he had become ardently attached besides serving for several terms in the city council and as warden of the port for twentywo years during the war of he rendered valuable financial aid in mr girard having about one million dollars in the hands of baring bros co london ordered the whole of it to be used in buying stock and shares of the bank of the united states when the charter of the bank expired in mr girard purchased the whole outfit and opened the bank of stephen girard with a capital of one million two hundred thousand dollars about this time an attempt was made by two men to kidnap mr girard by enticing him into a house to buy goods then seize him and carry him to a small ship in the delaware where he would be confined till he had paid the money which they demanded the plot was discovered after the men were arrested and in prison for several months one was declared insane and the other was acquitted on the ground of comparative ignorance of the plot everybody believed in mr girard honesty and in the safety of his bank he made temporary loans to the government never refusing his aid when near the close of the war the government endeavored to float a loan of five million dollars the bonds to bear interest at seven per cent per annum and a bonus offered to capitalists there was so much indifference or fear of future payment or opposition to the war with great britain that only were subscribed for mr girard determined to stake his whole fortune to save the credit of his adopted country he put his name opposite the whole of the loan still unsubscribed for the effect was magical people at once had faith in the government professed themselves true patriots and persisted in taking shares from mr girard which he gave them on the original terms the sinews of war were thus furnished says mr arey public confidence was restored and a series of brilliant victories resulted in a peace to which he thus referred in a letter written in to his friend morton of bordeaux he peace which has taken place between this country and england will consolidate forever our independence and insure our tranquillity soon after the close of the war on sept word was sent to mr girard that his wife still insane was dying years before when he found that she was incurable he had sought a divorce which those who admire him most must wish that he had never attempted and the bill failed he was now sixtyive and growing old his life had been too long in the shadow ever to be very full of light he asked to be sent for when all was over toward sunset when mary girard was in her plain coffin word was sent to him he came with his household and followed her to her restinglace in the lawn at the north front of the hospital i shall never forget the last and closing scene writes professor william wagner we all stood about the coffin when mr girard filled with emotion stepped forward kissed his wife corpse and his tears moistened her cheek she was buried in silence after the manner of the friends who manage the hospital after the coffin was lowered mr girard looked in and saying to mr samuel coates it is very well returned to his home mary girard grave and that of another who died in giving the hospital five thousand dollars on condition that he be buried there are now covered by the clinic building erected in the bodies were not disturbed as there is no cellar under the structure as a reward for the care of his wife soon after the burial mr girard gave the hospital about three thousand dollars and small sums of money to the attendants and nurses it was his intention to be buried beside his wife but this plan was changed later the next year president madison having chartered the second bank of the united states there were so few subscribers that it was evident that the scheme would fail at the last moment mr girard placed his name against the stock not subscribed for hree million one hundred thousand dollars again confidence was restored to a hesitating and timid public some years later in when the state of pennsylvania was in pressing need for money to carry on its daily functions the governor asked mr girard to loan the state one hundred thousand dollars which was cheerfully done as it was known that mr girard had amassed great wealth and had no children he was constantly besought to give from all parts of the country letters came from france begging that his native land be remembered through some grand institution of benevolence ambitious though mr girard was and conscious of the power of money he had without doubt been saving and accumulating for other reasons than love of gain his will made feb by his legal adviser mr william j duane after months of conference showed that mr girard had been thinking for years about the disposition of his millions when persons seemed inquisitive during his life he would say my deeds must be my life when i am dead my actions must speak for me to the last mr girard was devoted to business when death comes for me he said he will find me busy unless i am asleep in bed if i thought i was going to die toorrow i should plant a tree nevertheless toay his only recreation from business was going daily to his farm of nearly six hundred acres in passyunk township where he set out choice plants and fruitrees and raised the best produce for the philadelphia market his yellowodied gig and stout horse were familiar objects to the townspeople though he always preferred walking to riding his home in later years a fourtory brick house was somewhat handsomely furnished with ebony chairs and seats of crimson plush from france a present from his brother tienne a tall writingabinet containing an organ given him by joseph bonaparte the brother of napoleon and the exing of spain and naples who usually dined with mr girard on sunday a turkey carpet and marble statuary purchased in leghorn by his brother jean the home was made cheerful by his young relatives he had in his family the three daughters of jean and two sons of tienne whom he educated he loved animals always keeping a large watchog at his home and on each of his ships saying that his property was thus much more efficiently protected than through the services of those to whom he paid wages he was very fond of children horses dogs and canaryirds in his private office several canaries swung in brass cages and these he taught to sing with a bird organ which he imported from france for that purpose when mr girard was seventyix years of age a violent attack of erysipelas in the head and legs led him to confine himself thereafter to a vegetable diet as long as he lived the sight of his one eye finally grew so dim that he was scarcely able to find his way about the streets and he was often seen to grope about the vestibule of his bank to find the door on feb as he was crossing the road at second and market streets he was struck and badly injured by a wagon the wheel of which passed over his head and cut his face he managed to regain his feet and reach his home while the doctors were dressing the wound and cleansing it of the sand he said go on doctor i am an old sailor i can bear a good deal after some months he was able to return to his bank but in december nearly two years after the accident an attack of influenza then prevailing followed by pneumonia caused his death he lay in a stupor for some days but finally rallied and walked across the room the effort was too great and putting his hand against his forehead he exclaimed how violent is this disorder how very extraordinary it is and soon died without speaking again at five olock in the afternoon of dec nearly eightywo years old he was given a public funeral by the city which he had so many times befriended a great concourse of people gathered to watch the procession or to join it all houses being closed along the route the city officials walking beside the coffin carried in an open hearse so large a funeral had never been known in philadelphia said the press the body was taken to the holy trinity roman catholic church and placed in the vault of baron henry dominick lallemand general of artillery under napoleon i who had married the youngest daughter of girard brother jean mr girard was born in the romish church and never severed his connection although he attended a church but rarely he liked the friends and modelled his life after their virtues but he said it was better for a man to die in the faith in which he was born he gave generously to all religious denominations and to the poor when mr girard will was read it was apparent for what purpose he had saved his money he gave away about a remarkable record for a youth who left home at fourteen and rose from a cabinoy to be one of the wealthiest men of his time the first gift in the will and the largest to any existing corporation was to the pennsylvania hospital where mary girard died and was buried the income to be used in providing nurses to the institution for the deaf and dumb mr girard left to the philadelphia orphan asylum public schools to purchase fuel forever in march and august for distribution in january among poor white housekeepers of good character the income from to the society for poor masters of ships and their families to the poor among the masonic fraternity of pennsylvania to build a schoolhouse at passyunk where he had his farm to his brother tienne and to each of the six children of this brother to each of his nieces from to to each captain of his vessels and to each of his housekeepers an annuity or yearly sum of besides various amounts to servants to the city of philadelphia to improve her delaware river front to pull down and remove wooden buildings within the city limits and to widen and pave water street the income of to the commonwealth of pennsylvania for internal improvements by canal navigation to the cities of new orleans and philadelphia to promote the health and general prosperity of the inhabitants acres of land in the state of louisiana the city of philadelphia has been fortunate in her gifts the elias boudinot fund for supplying the poor of the city with fuel furnished over three hundred tons of coal last year and this amount will increase annually by reason of the larger income derived from the acres of land situated in centre county the property of this trust the investments and cash balance on dec amounted to benjamin franklin at his death april gave to each of the two cities philadelphia and boston in trust to be loaned to young married mechanics under twentyive years of age to help them start in business in sums not to exceed nor to be less than at five per cent interest the money to be paid back by them in ten annual payments of ten per cent each two respectable citizens were to become surety for the payment of the money this franklin did because two men helped him when young to begin business in philadelphia by a loan and thus he said laid the foundation of his fortune a bequest somewhat similar was founded in london more than twenty years previously in he wilson loan fund to lend sums of to to young tradesmen of the city of london etc at two per cent per annum dr franklin estimated that his at interest for one hundred years would increase to over and then the managers of the fund were to lay out says the will in public works which may be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants such as fortifications bridges aqueducts public buildings baths pavements or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people and render it more agreeable to strangers resorting hither for health or a temporary residence in philadelphia dr franklin hoped the would be used in bringing by pipes the water of the wissahickon creek to take the place of well water and in making the schuylkill completely navigable if these things had been done by the end of the hundred years the money could be used for other public works the remaining was to be put at interest for another hundred years when it would amount to or of this amount was to be given to philadelphia and the same to boston and the balance or paid to each state the figures are of especial interest as showing how fast money will accumulate if kept at interest the descendants of franklin have tried to break the will but have not succeeded the board of directors of city trusts of philadelphia report for the year ending dec that the fund of for the first hundred years though not equalling the sum which franklin hoped has yet reached the large amount of the boston fund says mr samuel f mccleary the treasurer amounted at the end of a hundred years to of this sum was paid to the city of boston and was put at interest for another hundred years this has already increased to what an amount of good some other man or woman might do with it remains to be seen to what use the two cities will put their gifts perhaps they will provide work for the unemployed in making good roads or in some other useful labor or instead of loaning money to mechanics as franklin intended perhaps they will erect tenement houses for mechanics or other working people as is done by some cities in england and scotland following the example so nobly set by george peabody when he gave his which has now doubled to build houses for the london poor he said if judiciously managed for two hundred years its accumulation will amount to a sum sufficient to buy the city of london if stephen girard to the state of pennsylvania had been given for the making of good roads thousands of the unemployed might have been provided with labor tens of thousands of poor horses saved from useless overork in hauling loads over muddy roads where the wheels sink to the hubs and the farmers saved thousands of dollars in carrying their produce to cities stephen girard had a larger gift in mind than those to his adopted city and state he said in his will i have been for a long time impressed with the importance of educating the poor and of placing them by the early cultivation of their minds and the development of their moral principles above the many temptations to which through poverty and ignorance they are exposed and i am particularly desirous to provide for such a number of poor male white orphan children as can be trained in one institution a better education as well as a more comfortable maintenance than they usually receive from the application of the public funds with this object in view a college for orphan boys mr girard gave to the mayor aldermen and citizens of philadelphia all the residue and remainder of my real and personal estate in trust first to erect and maintain a college for poor white male orphans second to establish a competent police and third to improve the general appearance of the city itself and in effect to diminish the burden of taxation now most oppressive especially on those who are the least able to bear it after providing for the college as my primary object he left allowing as much of that sum as may be necessary in erecting the college which was to be constructed with the most durable materials and in the most permanent manner avoiding needless ornament he gave the most minute directions in his will for its size material marble or granite and the training and education of the inmates this residue and remainder of my real and personal estate had grown in to more than with an income yearly of about truly stephen girard had saved and labored for a magnificent and enduring monument the girard estate is one of the largest owners of real estate in the city of philadelphia outside of the city some of the girard land is valuable in coal production in the year tons of anthracite coal were mined from the girard land more than received from its coal has been invested that the college may be doubly sure of its support when the coalines are exhausted girard college of white marble in the form of a greek temple was begun in may two years after mr girard death and was fourteen years and six months in building a broad platform reached by eleven marble steps supports the main building thirtyour corinthian columns form a colonnade about the structure each column six feet in diameter and fiftyive feet high and each weighing one hundred and three tons and costing about apiece they are beautiful and substantial and yet would support several orphans for a year or more the floors and roof are of marble and the threetory building weighs over tons the average weight on each superficial foot of foundation being according to mr arey about six tons four auxiliary white marble buildings were required by the will of mr girard for dormitories schoolrooms etc the whole fortyive acres in which stand the college buildings are surrounded according to the given instructions by a wall ten feet high and sixteen inches thick covered with a heavy marble capping the five buildings were completed nov at a cost of nearly and on jan girard college was opened with one hundred orphans in the autumn one hundred more were admitted and on april one hundred more those born in the city of philadelphia have the first preference after them those born in the state those born in new york city where mr girard first landed in america and then those born in new orleans where he first traded they must enter between the ages of six and ten be fatherless although the mother may be living and must remain in the college till they are between fourteen and eighteen when they are bound out by the mayor till they are twentyne to learn some suitable trade in the arts manufacture or agriculture their tastes being consulted as far as possible each orphan has three suits of clothing one for every day one better and one usually reserved for sundays the first president of girard college was alexander dallas bache a greatrandson of benjamin franklin and head of the coast survey of the united states he visited similar institutions in europe and purchased the necessary books and apparatus for the school while the college was building the heirs with the not unusual disregard of the testator desires endeavored to break the will mr girard had given the following specific direction in his will i enjoin and require that no ecclesiastic missionary or minister of any sect whatsoever shall ever hold or exercise any station or duty whatever in the said college nor shall any such person ever be admitted for any purpose or as a visitor within the premises appropriated to the purposes of the said college n making this restriction i do not mean to cast any reflection upon any sect or person whatsoever but as there is such a multitude of sects and such a diversity of opinion amongst them i desire to keep the tender minds of the orphans who are to derive advantage from this bequest free from the excitement which clashing doctrines and sectarian controversy are so apt to produce my desire is that all the instructors and teachers in the college shall take pains to instil into the minds of the scholars the purest principles of morality so that on their entrance into active life they may from inclination and habit evince benevolence toward their fellowreatures and a love of truth sobriety and industry adopting at the same time such religious tenets as their matured reason may enable them to prefer the heirs of mr girard claimed that by reason of the above the college was illegal and immoral derogatory and hostile to the christian religion but it was the unanimous decision of the supreme court that there was in the will nothing inconsistent with the christian religion or opposed to any known policy of the state on sept the body of stephen girard was removed from the roman catholic church but not without a lawsuit by the heirs on account of its removal to the college and placed in a sarcophagus in the vestibule the ceremony was entirely masonic the three hundred orphans witnessing it from the steps of the college over fifteen hundred masons were in the procession and each deposited his palmranch upon the coffin in front of the sarcophagus is a statue of mr girard by gevelot of paris costing thirty thousand dollars girard college now has ten white marble auxiliary buildings for its nearly or quite two thousand orphans there are more applicants than there is room to accommodate its handsome gothic chapel is also of white marble erected in here each day the pupils gather for worship morning and evening the exercises nonectarian in character consisting of a hymn reading from the bible and prayer on sundays the pupils assemble in their section rooms at nine in the morning and two in the afternoon for religious reading and instruction and at and they attend worship in the chapel addresses being given by the president a h fetterolf ph or some invited layman in the technical building was erected in the western part of the grounds here instruction is given in metal and woodwork mechanical drawing shoemaking blacksmithing carpentry foundry plumbing steamitting and electrical mechanics here the pupils learn about the dynamo motor lighting by electricity telegraphy and the like about six hundred boys in this department spend five hours a week in this practical work at the world columbian exposition at chicago in the exhibit made by girard college one could see the admirable work of the students in a singlepan bridge a four horseower yacht steamngine a vertical engine etc the whole exhibit was given at the close of the exposition to armour institute to which the founder mr philip armour has given to the west of the main college building is the monument erected by the board of directors to the memory of girard college boys killed in the civil war a lifeize figure of a soldier stands beneath a canopy supported by four columns of ohio sandstone the granite base is overgrown with ivy on one side are the names of the fallen on the other these words from mr girard will and especially do i desire that by every proper means a pure attachment to our republican institutions and to the sacred rights of conscience as guaranteed by our happy constitutions shall be formed and fostered in the minds of the scholars on may each year the anniversary of mr girard birth the graduates of girard college gather from all parts of the country to do honor to the generous giver games are played the cadets parade and a dinner is provided for scholars and guests the pupils seem happy and contented their playgrounds are large and they have a bathingool for swimming in summer and skating in winter they receive a good education in mathematics astronomy geology history chemistry physics french spanish with some latin and greek with a course in business shorthand etc through all the years they have character lessons which every school should have throughout our country amiliar conversations on honesty the dignity of labor perseverance courage selfontrol bad language value and use of time truthfulness temperance good temper the good citizen and his duties kindness to animals patriotism the study of the lives and deeds of noble men and women the golden rule of play no fun unless it is fun on both sides and similar topics oral and written exercises form a part of this work there is also a department of military science a two years course being given with one recitation a week a united states army officer is one of the college faculty and commandant of the battalion the annual cost of clothing and educating each of the two thousand orphans including current repairs on the buildings is a little more than three hundred dollars on leaving college each boy receives a trunk with clothing and books amounting to about seventyive dollars probably mr girard with all his farightedness could not have foreseen the great good to the nation as well as to the individual in thus fitting year after year thousands of poor orphans for useful positions in life mr arey well says when in the fulness of time many homes have been made happy many orphans have been fed clothed and educated and many men rendered useful to their country and themselves each happy home or rescued child or useful citizen will be a living monument to perpetuate the name and embalm the memory of the dead ariner and merchant andrew carnegie and his libraries this then is held to be the duty of the man of wealth first to set an example of modest unostentatious living shunning display or extravagance to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds which he is called upon to administer and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which in his judgment is best calculated to produce the most beneficial results for the community he man of wealth thus becoming the mere trustee and agent for his poorer brethren thus wrote andrew carnegie in his gospel of wealth published in the north american review for june this article so interested mr gladstone that he asked the editor of the review to permit its republication in england which was done when the world follows this gospel and those who have means consider themselves trustees for their poorer brethren and their money as trust funds we shall see little of the heartbreak and the poverty of the present age illustration always your friend andrew carnegi ring in the valiant man and free the larger heart the kindlier hand ring out the darkness of the land ring in the christ that is to be andrew carnegie was born at dunfermline scotland nov into a poor but honest home his father william carnegie was a weaver a man of good sense strongly republican though living under a monarchy and wellead upon the questions of the day the mother was a woman of superior mind and character to whom andrew was unusually devoted till her death in when he had reached middle life when andrew was twelve years of age and his brother thomas five the parents decided to make their home in the new world coming to new york in a sailingessel in they travelled to pittsburg penn and lived for some time in allegheny city andrew had been sent to school in dunfermline and having a fondness for books was a bright ambitious boy at twelve ready to begin the struggle for a living so as to make the family burdens lighter work was not easily found but finally he obtained employment as a bobbinoy in a cotton factory at a week mr carnegie when grown to manhood wrote in the youth companion april i cannot tell you how proud i was when i received my first week own earnings one dollar and twenty cents made by myself and given to me because i had been of some use in the world no longer entirely dependent upon my parents but at last admitted to the family partnership as a contributing member and able to help them i think this makes a man out of a boy sooner than almost anything else and a real man too if there be any germ of true manhood in him it is everything to feel that you are useful i have had to deal with great sums many millions of dollars have since passed through my hands but the genuine satisfaction i had from that one dollar and twenty cents outweighs any subsequent pleasure in moneyetting it was the direct reward of honest manual labor it represented a week of very hard work so hard that but for the aim and end which sanctified it slavery might not be much too strong a term to describe it for a lad of twelve to rise and breakfast every morning except the blessed sunday morning and go into the streets and find his way to the factory and begin work while it was still dark outside and not be released until after darkness came again in the evening forty minutes interval only being allowed at noon was a terrible task but i was young and had my dreams and something within always told me that this would not could not should not last should some day get into a better position besides this i felt myself no longer a mere boy but quite little man and this made me happy another place soon opened for the lad where he was set to fire a boiler in a cellar and to manage the small steamngine which drove the machinery in a bobbin factory the firing of this boiler was all right says mr carnegie for fortunately we did not use coal but the refuse wooden chips and i always liked to work in wood but the responsibility of keeping the water right and of running the engine and the danger of my making a mistake and blowing the whole factory to pieces caused too great a strain and i often awoke and found myself sitting up in bed through the night trying the steamauges but i never told them at home that i was having a ard tussle no no everything must be bright to them this was a point of honor for every member of the family was working hard except of course my little brother who was then a child and we were telling each other only all the bright things besides this no man would whine and give up e would die first there was no servant in our family and several dollars per week were earned by he mother by binding shoes after her daily work was done father was also hard at work in the factory and could i complain wages were small and in every leisure moment andrew looked for something better to do he went one day to the office of the atlantic and ohio telegraph company and asked for work as a messenger james douglas reid the manager was a scotchman and liked the lad manner i liked the boy looks said mr reid afterwards and it was easy to see that though he was little he was full of spirit his pay was a week he had not been with me a full month when he began to ask whether i would teach him to telegraph i began to instruct him and found him an apt pupil he spent all his spare time in practice sending and receiving by sound and not by tape as was largely the custom in those days pretty soon he could do as well as i could at the key and then his ambition carried him away beyond doing the drudgery of messenger work the boy liked his new occupation he once wrote my entrance into the telegraph office was the transition from darkness to light from firing a small engine in a dirty cellar to a clean office where there were books and papers that was a paradise to me and i bless my stars that sent me to be a messengeroy in a pittsburg telegraph office when andrew was fourteen his father died leaving him the only support of his mother and brother seven years old he believed in work and never shirked any duty however hard he soon found employment as telegraph operator with the pennsylvania railroad company at fifteen he was trainespatcher a place of unusual responsibility for a boy but his energy carefulness and industry were equal to the demands on him when he was sixteen andrew had thought out a plan by which trains could be run on single tracks and the telegraph be used to govern their running his scheme was the one now in universal use on the singleracked roads in the country namely to run trains in opposite directions until they approached within comparatively a few miles and then hold one at a station until the other had passed this thought about the telegraph brought andrew into notice among those above him and he was transferred to altoona the headquarters of the general manager young carnegie had done what he recommends others to do in his how to win fortune in the new york tribune april he says george eliot put the matter very pithily tell you how i got on i kept my ears and my eyes open and i made my master interest my own the condition precedent for promotion is that the man must first attract notice he must do something unusual and especially must this be beyond the strict boundary of his duties he must suggest or save or perform some service for his employer which he could not be censured for not having done when he has thus attracted the notice of his immediate superior whether that be only the foreman of a gang it matters not the first great step has been taken for upon his immediate superior promotion depends how high he climbs is his own affair carnegie kept his eyes and ears open in his triumphant democracy he relates the following incident well do i remember that when a clerk in the service of the pennsylvania railroad company a tall spare farmerooking kind of man came to me once when i was sitting on the end seat of the rear car looking over the line he said he had been told by the conductor that i was connected with the railway company and he wished me to look at an invention he had made with that he drew from a green bag as if it were for lawyers brief a small model of a sleepingerth for railway cars he had not spoken a minute before like a flash the whole range of the discovery burst upon me es i said hat is something which this continent must have i promised to address him upon the subject as soon as i had talked over the matter with my superior thomas a scott i could not get that blessed sleepingar out of my head upon my return i laid it before mr scott declaring that it was one of the inventions of the age he remarked ou are enthusiastic young man but you may ask the inventor to come and let me see it i did so and arrangements were made to build two trial cars and run them on the pennsylvania railroad i was offered an interest in the venture which of course i gladly accepted payments were to be made ten per cent per month after the cars were delivered the pennsylvania railroad company guaranteeing to the builders that the cars should be kept upon its line and under its control this was all very satisfactory until the notice came that my share of the first payment was how well i remember the exact sum but two hundred and seventeen dollars and a half were as far beyond my means as if it had been millions i was earning fifty dollars per month however and had prospects or at least i always felt that i had what was to be done i decided to call on the local banker mr state the case and boldly ask him to advance the sum upon my interest in the affair he put his hand on my shoulder and said hy of course andie you are all right go ahead here is the money it is a proud day for a man when he pays his last note but not to be named in comparison with the day in which he makes his first one and gets a banker to take it i have tried both and i know the cars paid the subsequent payments from their earnings i paid my first note from my savings so much per month and thus did i get my foot on fortune ladder it is easy to climb after that a triumphant success was scored and thus came sleepingars into the world lessed be the man who invented sleep says sancho panza thousands upon thousands will echo the sentiment lessed be the man who invented sleepingars let me record his name and testify my gratitude to him my dear quiet modest truthful farmerooking friend t t woodruff one of the benefactors of the age mr pullman later engaged in sleepingar building and carnegie advised his firm to capture mr pullman there was a capture says mr carnegie but it did not quite take that form they found themselves swallowed by this ogre and pullman monopolized everything while a very young man carnegie was appointed superintendent of the western division of the pennsylvania railroad as superintendent he became the friend of colonel scott and together with some others they bought several farms along the line of the road which proved very valuable oilands mr carnegie says of the storey farm oil creek we purchased the farm for and so small was our faith in the ability of the earth to yield for any considerable time the hundred barrels per day which the property was then producing that we decided to make a pond capable of holding one hundred thousand barrels of oil which we estimated would be worth when the supply ceased unfortunately for us the pond leaked fearfully evaporation also caused much loss but we continued to run oil in to make the losses good day after day until several hundred thousand barrels had gone in this fashion our experience with the farm may be worth reciting its value rose to that is the shares of the company sold in the market upon this basis and one year it paid in cash dividends ather a good return upon an investment of so great was the yield in the district that in two years oil became almost valueless often selling as low as thirty cents per barrel and not infrequently it was suffered to run to waste as utterly worthless but as new uses were found for the oil prices rose again and to remove the difficulty of high freights pipes were laid first for short distances and then to the seaboard a distance of about three hundred miles through these pipes of which six thousand two hundred miles have been laid the oil is now pumped from two thousand one hundred wells it costs only ten cents to pump a barrel of oil to the atlantic the value of petroleum and its products exported up to january exceeds in value within ten years from the time when mr carnegie and his friends bought the oilarms their investment had returned them four hundred and one per cent and the young scotchman could count himself a rich man before this however he had entered the iron and steel industry in which his great wealth has been made with a little money which he had saved he borrowed from a bank and with five other persons established the keystone bridge works of pittsburg with the small capital of this was a success from the first and in latter years has had a capital of it has built bridges all over the country and structural frames for many public buildings in new york chicago and other cities from this time forward mr carnegie career has been a most successful one he has become chief owner in the union iron works the edgar thomson steel works the homestead steel works formerly a rival company the duquesne works of the allegheny bessemer steel company and several other iron and coke companies the capital of these companies is about and about twentyive thousand men are employed in carnegie bros co limited says the engineering and mining journal for july had a capacity to produce tons of steel rails per annum or over twentyive per cent of the total capacity of all the rollingills of the united states while its products of steel girders plates nails and other forms of manufactured iron and steel are greater than at any other works in this country and exceed the amount turned out at the famous krupp works in germany the company has supplied the united states government with a large amount of armor plates for our new ships and also filled a large order for the russian government the edgar thomson steel works have an annual capacity of gross tons of ingots gross tons of rails and billets and gross tons of castings the duquesne furnaces have a yearly capacity of gross tons of pigron the lucy furnaces gross tons yearly the duquesne steel works an annual capacity of gross tons of ingots the homestead steel works have an annual capacity of gross tons of bessemer steel and ingots and gross tons of openearth steel ingots the upper union mills have an annual output of gross tons of steel bars and steel universal milllates etc the lower union mills an annual capacity of gross tons of milllates bridgeork carorgings etc the industrious ambitious boy was not satisfied merely to amass wealth he had always been a great reader and thinker in charles scribner sons published a book by this successful telegraph operator and iron manufacturer an american fournand in britain the trip was suggested by mr black novel the strange adventures of a phaeton and extended from brighton to inverness a distance of eight hundred and thirtyne miles mr carnegie and his party of chosen friends made the journey by coach in seven weeks from july to aug and had a most enjoyable as well as instructive trip the critic gives mr carnegie wellerited praise saying that he has produced a book of travel as fresh as though he had been exploring thibet or navigating the river of golden sand the book is dedicated to my favorite heroine my mother who was the queen dowager of the volume and whose happiness during the journey seemed to be the chief concern of her devoted son this book had so cordial a reception that the following year another volume was published round the world covering a trip made in mr carnegie having sailed from san francisco to japan and thence through the lands of the east as he starts his mother puts in his hand shakespeare in thirteen small volumes and these are his company and delight in the long ocean voyage through china india and other countries he observes closely learns much and tells it in a way that is always interesting life at the east he says lacks two of its most important elements he want of intelligent and refined women as the companion of man and a sunday it has been a strange experience to me to be for several months without the society of some of this class of women ometimes many weeks without even speaking to one and often a whole week without even seeing the face of an educated woman and bachelor as i am let me confess what a miserable dark dreary and insipid life this would be without their constant companionship ten years later in mr carnegie published a book that had a very wide reading and at once placed the author prominently before the new world and the old world as well triumphant democracy or fifty years march of the republic the book showed extensive research a deep love for his adopted country america a warm heart and an able mind he wrote to the beloved republic under whose equal laws i am made the peer of any man although denied political equality by my native land i dedicate this book with an intensity of gratitude and admiration which the nativeorn citizen can neither feel nor understand no one can read this book without being amazed at the power and possibilities of the republic and without a deeper love for and pride in the greatness and true worth of his country the style is bright and attractive and the facts stated remarkable americans must always be debtors to the scotchman who has shown them how to prize their native land mr carnegie wrote the book as a labor of love to show the people of the old world the advantages of a republic over a monarchical form of government and to americans a juster estimate than prevails in some quarters of the political and social advantages which they so abundantly possess over the people of the older and less advanced lands that they may be still prouder and even more devoted if possible to their institutions than they are mr carnegie shows by undisputed facts that america so recently a colony of great britain has now become the wealthiest nation in the world the greatest agricultural nation the greatest manufacturing nation the greatest mining nation in the world in the ten years from to says mr carnegie eleven and a half millions were added to the population of america yet these only added three persons to each square mile of territory and should america continue to double her population every thirty years instead of every twentyive years as hitherto seventy years must elapse before she will attain the density of europe the population will then reach two hundred and ninety millions mr carnegie has said in his imperial federation published in the nineteenth century september even if the united states increase is to be much less rapid than it has been hitherto yet the child is born who will see more than under her sway no possible increase of the race can be looked for in all the world combined comparable to this green truly says that its uture home is to be found along the banks of the hudson and the mississippi it will surprise many to know that the whole united kingdom england scotland and irelan could be planted in texas and leave plenty of room around it the farms of america equal the entire territory of the united kingdom france belgium germany austria hungary and portugal the cornields equal the extent of england scotland and belgium while the grainields generally would overlap spain the cottonields cover an area larger than holland and twice as large as belgium the growth of manufactures in america is amazing in thirty years from to mr carnegie says there was an increase of nearly six hundred per cent while the increase in british manufactures was little more than a hundred per cent the total in america in was in the united kingdom probably the most rapid development of an industry that the world has ever seen says mr carnegie is that of bessemer steel in america in america made tons of bessemer in fifteen years later she made tons which was tons more than great britain made this is advancing not by leaps and bounds it is one grand rush rush without pause which has made america the greatest manufacturer of bessemer steel in the world one is startled to find that more yards of carpet are manufactured in and around the city of philadelphia alone than in the whole of great britain it is not twenty years since the american imported his carpets and now he makes more at one point than the greatest european manufacturing nation does in all its territory of the manufacture of boots and shoes by machinery mr carnegie says a man can make three hundred pairs of boots in a day and a single factory in massachusetts turns out as many pairs yearly as thirtywo thousand bootmakers in paris twentyive years ago the american conceived the idea of making watches by machinery upon a gigantic scale the principal establishment made only five watches per day as late as now thirteen hundred per day is the daily task and six thousand watches per month are sent to the london agency the progress in mining has been equally remarkable to the world stock of gold says mr carnegie america has contributed according to mulhall more than fifty per cent in he estimated the amount of gold in the world at tons worth of this the new world contributed tons or more than half one of the most remarkable veins of metal known is the comstock lode in nevada in fourteen years this single vein yielded in one year the product of the lode was in gold and in silver total of here again is something which the world never saw before america also leads the world in copper the united states and chili contributing nearly onealf the world supply on the south shore of lake superior this metal is found almost pure in masses of all sizes up to many tons in weight it was used by the native indians and traces of their rude mining operations are still visible mr carnegie says the anthracite coalields of pennsylvania will produce tons per year for four hundred and thirtyine years and he thinks by that time men will probably be burning the hydrogen of water or be fully utilizing the solar rays or the tidal energy the coal area of the united states comprises square miles and mr carnegie is almost ashamed to confess it she has threeuarters of all the coal area of the earth while mr carnegie admires and loves the republic he is devoted to the mother country and is a most earnest advocate of peace between us he writes of all the desirable political changes which it seems to me possible for this generation to effect i consider it by far the most important for the welfare of the race that every civilized nation should be pledged as the republic is to offer peaceful arbitration to its opponent before the senseless inhuman work of human slaughter begins in his imperial federation he writes war between members of our race may be said to be already banished for englishpeaking men will never again be called upon to destroy each other both parties in america and each successive government are pledged to offer peaceful arbitration for the adjustment of all international difficulties position which it is to be hoped will soon be reached by britain at least in regard to all the differences with members of the same race is it too much to hope that after this stage has been reached and occupied successfully for a period another step forward will be taken and that having jointly banished war between themselves a general council should be evolved by the englishpeaking nations to which may at first only be referred all questions of dispute between them the supreme court of the united states is extolled by the statesmen of all parties in britain and has just received the compliment of being copied in the plan for the australian commonwealth building upon it may we not expect that a still higher supreme court is one day to come which shall judge between the nations of the entire englishpeaking race as the supreme court at washington already judges between states which contain the majority of the race mr carnegie believes that the powers of the council would increase till the commanding position of the englishpeaking race would make other races listen to its demands for peace and so war be forever done away with mr carnegie rightly calls war international murder and like tennyson looks forward to that blessed time when all men good be each man rule and universal peace lie like a shaft of light across the land and like a lane of beams athwart the sea mr carnegie has also written in the north american review for june the a b of money urging the republic to keep its standard in the future as in the past not fluctuating silver but unchanging gold in his articles in the newspapers and in his public addresses he has given good advice to young men in whom he takes the deepest interest he believes there never were so many opportunities to succeed as now for the sober frugal energetic young man real ability the capacity for doing things never was so eagerly searched for as now and never commanded such rewards the great dryoods houses that interest their most capable men in the profits of each department succeed when those fail that endeavor to work with salaried men only even in the management of our great hotels it is found wise to take into partnership the principal men in every branch of business this law is at work and concerns are prosperous generally speaking just in proportion as they succeed in interesting in the profits a larger and larger proportion of their ablest workers coperation in this form is fast coming in all great establishments to young men he says never enter a barroom it is low and common to enter a barroom unworthy of any selfespecting man and sure to fasten upon you a taint which will operate to your disadvantage in life whether you ever become a drunkard or not don smoke the use of tobacco requires young men to withdraw themselves from the society of women to indulge the habit i think the absence of women from any assembly tends to lower the tone of that assembly the habit of smoking tends to carry young men into the society of men whom it is not desirable that they should choose as their intimate associates the practice of chewing tobacco was once common now it is considered offensive i believe the race is soon to take another step forward and that the coming man is to consider smoking as offensive as chewing was formerly considered never speculate never buy or sell grain or stocks upon a margin the man who gambles upon the exchanges is in the condition of the man who gambles at the gamingable he rarely if ever makes a permanent success don indorse there are emergencies no doubt in which men should help their friends but there is a rule that will keep one safe no man should place his name upon the obligation of another if he has not sufficient to pay it without detriment to his own business it is dishonest to do so mr carnegie has not only written books and made money he has distinguished himself as a giver of millions and that while he is alive he has seen too many wills broken and fortunes misapplied when the money was not given away till death he says of mr tilden bequest of over for a free library in the city of new york how much better if mr tilden had devoted the last years of his own life to the proper administration of this immense sum in which case neither legal contest nor any other cause of delay could have interfered with his aims of course money is sometimes so tied up in business that it cannot be given during a man life yet says mr carnegie the day is not far distant when the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth which was free for him to administer during life will pass away nwept unhonored and unsung no matter to what uses he leaves the dross which he cannot take with him of such as these the public verdict will then be he man who dies thus rich dies disgraced he believes large estates left at death should be taxed by the state as is the case in pennsylvania and some other states mr carnegie does not favor large gifts left to families why should men leave great fortunes to their children he asks if this is done from affection is it not misguided affection observation teaches that generally speaking it is not well for the children that they should be so burdened neither is it well for the state beyond providing for the wife and daughters moderate sources of income and very moderate allowances indeed if any for the sons men may well hesitate for it is no longer questionable that great sums bequeathed often work more for the injury than for the good of the recipients there are instances of millionnaires sons unspoiled by wealth who being rich still perform great services to the community such are the very salt of the earth as valuable as unfortunately they are rare again mr carnegie says of wealth left to the young it deadens their energies destroys their ambition tempts them to destruction and renders it almost impossible that they should lead lives creditable to themselves or valuable to the state such as are not deadened by wealth deserve double credit for they have double temptation in the north american review for december mr carnegie suggests what he considers seven of the best uses for surplus wealth the founding of great universities free libraries hospitals or any means to alleviate human suffering public parks and flowerardens for the people conservatories such as mr phipps has given to the park at allegheny city which are visited by thousands suitable halls for lectures elevating music and other gatherings free or rented for a small sum free swimmingaths for the people attractive places of worship especially in poor localities mr carnegie own great gifts have been largely along the line which he believes the best gift to a community free public library he thinks with john bright that it is impossible for any man to bestow a greater benefit upon a young man than to give him access to books in a free library it is no doubt he says possible that my own personal experience may have led me to value a free library beyond all other forms of beneficence when i was a workingoy in pittsburg colonel anderson of allegheny name i can never speak without feelings of devotional gratitude pened his little library of four hundred books to boys every saturday afternoon he was in attendance at his house to exchange books no one but he who has felt it can ever know the intense longing with which the arrival of saturday was awaited that a new book might be had my brother and mr phipps who have been my principal business partners through life shared with me colonel anderson precious generosity and it was when revelling in the treasures which he opened to us that i resolved if ever wealth came to me that it should be used to establish free libraries that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to that noble man how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world again mr carnegie says i also come by heredity to my preference for free libraries the newspaper of my native town recently published a history of the free library in dunfermline and it is there recorded that the first books gathered together and opened to the public were the small collections of three weavers imagine the feelings with which i read that one of these three men was my honored father he founded the first library in dunfermline his native town and his son was privileged to found the last i have never heard of a lineage for which i would exchange that of the libraryounding weaver mr carnegie has given for the edinburgh free library scotland for one in his native town of dunfermline and several thousand dollars each to libraries in aberdeen peterhead inverness ayr elgin wick and kirkwall besides contributions towards public halls and readingooms at newburgh aberdour and many other places abroad mr carnegie mother laid the cornertone for the free library in dunfermline he writes in his american fournand in britain there was something of the fairyale in the fact that she had left her native town poor thirty odd years before with her loved ones to found a new home in the great republic and was toay returning in her coach to be allowed the privilege of linking her name with the annals of her beloved native town in one of the most enduring forms possible when the cornertone

more blessed it is to give than to receive i wish that the masses of working men and women the wagearners of all allegheny will remember and act upon the fact that this is their library their gallery and their hall the poorest citizen the poorest man the poorest woman that toils from morn till night for a livelihood as thank heaven i had that toil to do in my early days as he walks this hall as he

ehold all this is mine i support it and i am proud to support it i am joint proprietor here since the library opened four years ago says mr william stevenson the librarian over books and periodicals have been put into the hands of readers the concerts have been exceedingly popular and incidentally have helped the library by drawing people to the library who might otherwise have remained in ignorance of the popularity and usefulness of the institution mr carnegie greatest gift has been the pittsburg library it is a magnificent building of gray ohio sandstone in the italian renaissance style of architecture with roof of red tile the architects were longfellow alden and harlow their plan being chosen from the one hundred and two sets of plans offered the library building is feet long and feet wide with two graceful towers each feet high and has capacity for volumes the entire stack or set of shelves for books is made of iron in six stories and is as nearly fireproof as possible the lower stories are for the circulatingooks the upper stories for referenceooks the library proper is in the centre of the building reached by a broad flight of stone steps above cut in stone are the words carnegie library free to the people the vestibule finished in marble with mosaic floors is handsomely decorated on the first floor are the circulatingibrary its blueeiling panels bordered with an interlace in orange and white a periodical room on either side one for scientific and technical the other for popular and literary magazines with rooms for cataloguing and for the library officials the reference readingoom on the second floor large beautiful and wellighted says the efficient librarian mr edwin h anderson is for quiet study here referenceooks such as encyclop dias dictionaries atlases etc are at hand on the shelves along the walls to be freely consulted this room is of a greenish tone with ivoryolored pilasters and arches and a fleureis pattern painted in the wallanels from the mark of a famous florentine printer and engraver four centuries ago across the corridor from the reference readingoom are five smaller rooms for special collections of books one is occupied by a musical library of two thousand volumes of the late karl merz which was bought and presented to the library by several citizens of pittsburg another will contain the collection to be purchased from the fund left by mr j bernd and will bear his name another will be used for artooks and another for science the children are to have a readingoom made attractive by juvenile books magazines and copies of good pictures a large and wellighted room in the basement is used for the leading newspapers of the country the library has a wing on either side one containing the artallery and the other the science museum the former has three large pictureooms on the second floor painted in dull red with a wallpace of feet for the exhibition of paintings and prints a corridor feet long in which statuary will be placed is decorated with copies of the frieze of the parthenon the basement of this wing will be devoted to the various departments of the artchools of pittsburg in the science museum three large wellighted rooms on the second floor will be used for collections in zo logy botany and mineralogy the closely allied branches of geology the study of the earth crust paleontology the study of life in former ages anthropology the natural history of the human species arch ology the science of antiquity and ethnology and ethnography treating of the origin relation characteristic costumes and habits of the human races will no doubt receive as much attention as space and funds will permit it is also expected that works of skill and invention will be gathered into an industrial museum for the benefit especially of the many artisans of pittsburg courses of free lectures will be given to teachers to pupils and to the public as in the american museum of natural history of new york below the three rooms in the museum are three lectureooms which can be used separately or as one room in one end of the large library building and separated from it by a thick wall so as to deaden sound is the musicall semiircular in plan with seats for two thousand one hundred persons and a stage for sixty musicians and a chorus of two hundred much sienna marble is used the floor is mosaic the walls are painted a deep roseolor and the architecture proper in a soft ivory tone with gilded ornamentation two free concerts or organ recitals are given each week through the year on the large modern concert organ built expressly for this hall musical lectures are also given free from technicalities illustrated by choir organ and piano this is certainly taking music art and science to the people as a free gift to this noble work mr carnegie has given of this amount was for the main building for the seven branch libraries or distributing stations and as an endowment fund for the artallery from the annual income of this artund which will be about at least three of the pictures purchased are to be the work of american artists exhibited that year preferably in the pittsburg gallery the city of pittsburg agrees to appropriate annually for the maintenance of the library system mr carnegie has always felt that the people should bear a part of the burden he said at the opening of the library nov every citizen of pittsburg even the very humblest now walks into this his own library for the poorest laborer contributes his mite indirectly to its support the man who enters a library is in the best society this world affords the good and the great welcome him surround him and humbly ask to be allowed to become his servants and if he himself from his own earnings contributes to its support he is more of a man than before if library hall gallery or museum be not popular and attract the manual toilers and benefit them it will have failed in its mission for it was chiefly for the wagearners that it was built by one who was himself a wagearner and who has the good of that class at heart mr carnegie has said elsewhere every free library in these days should contain upon its shelves all contributions bearing upon the relations of labor and capital from every point of view ocialistic communistic coperative and individualist and librarians should encourage visitors to read them all the library stands near the entrance of the valuable park of about acres given to the city by mrs schenley in this lady says mr carnegie although born in pittsburg married an english gentleman while yet in her teens it is forty years and more since she took up her residence in london among the titled and wealthy of the world metropolis but still she turns to the home of her childhood and by means of schenley park links her name with it forever a noble use this of great wealth by one who thus becomes her own administrator near the library are the conservatories given to the people by mr phipps and a source of most elevating pleasure mr carnegie gifts in and about pittsburg amount already to yet he is soon to build a library for homestead and one each for duquesne and the town of carnegie such other districts as may need branch libraries says mr carnegie we ardently hope we may be able to supply for to provide free libraries for all the people of pittsburg is a field which we would fain make our own as chief part of our lifeork i have dropped into the plural for there is one always with me to prompt encourage suggest discuss and advise and fortunately sometimes when necessary gently to criticise whose heart is as keenly in this work as my own preferring it to any other as the best possible use of surplus wealth and without whose wise and zealous coperation i often feel little useful work could be done mr carnegie has given to bellevue hospital medical college new york for a histological laboratory he is also the founder of the magnificent music hall on the corner of fiftyecond street and seventh avenue new york city the press says his investment in the music hall company limited equals nineenths of the full cost of the hall it was the dearest wish of the elder damrosch that a grand concertall suitable for oratorio choral and symphony performances might be built in new york the questions of cost endowment etc have been discussed many times by his associates and successors without definite result it was the liberality and public spirit of andrew carnegie which finally made possible the establishment of a completely equipped home for music the main hall exquisite in its decorations of ivory white gold and old rose will seat about three thousand persons with standingoom for a thousand more in the decorations lamps are placed of these are in the ceiling and the walls of the stage around the boxes and balconies and in the main ceiling when the electric current is turned on at night the effect is magical the electricight plant consists of four dynamos each weighing pounds besides the main hall there are several smaller rooms for recitals lectures readings receptions and studios mr carnegie will need no other monument than his great libraries the influence of which will increase in the coming centuries thomas holloway his sanatorium and college thomas holloway one of england most munificent givers was born in devonport england sept his father who had been a warrant officer in a militia regiment had become a baker in devonport finding that he could support his several children better by managing an inn he removed to penzance and took charge of turk head inn on chapel street his son thomas went to school at camborne and penzance until he was sixteen he was a saving lad for the family were obliged to be economical he must also have been energetic for this quality he displayed remarkably through life after his father died he and his mother and his brother henry opened a grocery and bakery shop in the marketplace at penzance mrs holloway the mother was the daughter of a farmer at trelyon lelant parish cornwall and knew how to help her sons make a living in the penzance shop when thomas was twentyight he seems to have tired of this kind of work or of the town for he went to london to struggle with its millions in making a fortune it seemed extremely improbable that he would make money but if he did not make he was too poor to lose much for twelve years he worked in various situations some of the time being secretary to a gentleman showing that he had improved his time while in school to be able to hold such a position in he had established himself as a merchant and foreign commercial agent at broad street buildings one of the men for whom mr holloway then thirtyix years old did business was felix albinolo an italian from turin who sold leeches and the st come et st damien ointment mr holloway introduced the italian to the doctors at st thomas hospital who liked the ointment and gave testimonials in its favor mr holloway hoping that he could make some money out of it prepared an ointment somewhat similar and announced it for sale oct he stated in his advertisement in the paper that holloway family ointment had received the commendation of herbert mayo senior surgeon at middlesex hospital aug albinolo warned the people in the same paper that the surgeon letter was given in connection with his ointment the composition of which was a secret whether this was true or not the surgeon made no denial of mr holloway statement a year later as albinolo could not sell his wares and was in debt he was committed to the debtors prison and nothing more is known of him or his ointment there were various reports about the holloway ointment and the pills which he soon after added to his stock it was said that for the making of one or both of these preparations an old german woman had confided her knowledge to mr holloway mother and she in turn had told her son mr holloway as long as he lived had great faith in his medicines and believed they would sell if they could be brought to the notice of the people every day he took his pills and his ointment to the docks to try to interest the captains and passengers sailing to all parts of the world people as usual were indifferent to an unknown man and unknown medicines and mr holloway went back to his rooms day after day with little money or success he advertised in the press as much as he was able indeed more than he was able for he got into debt and like albinolo was thrust into a debtors prison on white cross street he effected a release by arranging with his creditors whom he afterwards paid in full with ten per cent interest it is said to such as willingly granted his release mr holloway had married an unassuming girl miss jane driver soon after he came to london and she was assisting in his daily work mr holloway used to labor from four olock in the morning till ten at night living with his wife over his patentedicine warehouse at strand he told a friend years afterwards that the only recreation he and his wife had during the week was to take a walk in that crowded thoroughfare speaking of the great labor and anxiety in building up a business he said if i had then offered the business to any one as a gift they would not have accepted it the constant advertising created a demand for the medicines in five years after he began to make his pills and ointment mr holloway spent in advertising in he spent in in in in and later or each year mr holloway published directions for the use of his medicines in nearly every known language hinese turkish armenian arabic and most of the vernaculars of india he said he believed he had advertised in every respectable newspaper in existence the business had begun to pay well evidently in about twelve years after he started it for in that year mr holloway obtained an injunction against his brother who had commenced selling holloway pills and ointment at strand probably the brother thought a partnership in the bakery in their boyish days had fitted him for a partnership in the sale of the patent medicines in mr holloway sent a physician to france to introduce his preparations but the laws not being favorable to secret remedies not much was accomplished when the new law courts were built in london mr holloway moved his business to new oxford street since renumbered where he employed one hundred persons besides the scores in his branch offices of late years says the manchester guardian his business became a vast bankingoncern to which the selling of patent medicines was allied and he was understood to say some few years ago that his profits as a dealer in money approached the enormous sum of a year the groundloor of his large establishment in oxford street was occupied with clerks engaged in bookkeeping on the first and second floors one might gain a notion of the profits of pillaking by seeing young women filling boxes from small hillocks of pills containing a sufficient dose for a whole city on the topmost floor were mr holloway private apartments later in life mr holloway moved to a country home tittenhurst sunninghill which is about six miles from windsor and on the borders of the great park of eighteen hundred acres where he lived without any display and where his wife died sept at the age of seventyne he never had any desire for title or public prominence and when after his gifts had made him known and honored a baronetcy was suggested to him he would not consent to it mr holloway had worked untiringly he had not spent his money in extravagant living and now how should he use it for the best good of his country the noble earl of shaftesbury had been giving much of his early life to the amelioration of the insane he had visited asylums in england and seen lunatics chained to their beds living on bread and water or shut up in dark filthy cells neglected and often abused he ascertained that over seventyive per cent may be cured if treatment is given in the first twelve months only five per cent if given later he was astonished to find that no one seemed to care about these unfortunates he longed to see an asylum built for the insane of the middle classes he addressed public meetings in their behalf and mr holloway was in one of these meetings and listened to lord shaftesbury fervent appeal his heart was greatly moved and he visited shaftesbury and together they conferred about the great gift which was consummated later it is said also that at mr gladstone breakfastable mrs gladstone advised with mr holloway about the need of convalescent homes in the year mr holloway put aside nearly for an institution for the insane of the middle classes such as professional men clerks teachers and governesses as the lower classes were quite well provided for in public asylums a picturesque spot was chosen for the holloway sanatorium orty acres of ground near virginia water which is six miles from windsor though within the royal domains virginia water is a beautiful artificial lake about seven miles in circumference a mile and a half long and onehird of a mile wide the lake was formed in in order to drain the moorland by william duke of cumberland uncle of george near by is an obelisk with this inscription this obelisk was raised by the command of george after the battle of culloden in commemoration of the services of his son william duke of cumberland the success of his arms and the gratitude of his father this lake with its adjacent gardens pavilions and cascades was the favorite summer retreat of george who built there a fishingemple richly decorated a royal barge thirtywo feet long for the use of royalty is stationed on the lake in the midst of this attractive scenery mr holloway caused his forty acres to be laid out with tasteful flowereds walks and thousands of trees and shrubs occupied with his immense business he yet had time to watch the growth of his great benevolent project mr w h crossland who had built the fine town hall at rochdale was chosen as the architect and began at virginia water the stately and handsome sanatorium in the english renaissance style of architecture of red brick with stone trimmings there is a massive and lofty tower in the centre the interior is finished in gray marble which is enriched with cheerful colors and plentiful gilding the great lecture or concert hall adorned with portraits of distinguished persons by mr girardot and other artists has a very richly gilded roof the refectory is decorated by a series of beautiful fancy groups after watteau forming a frieze the six hundred rooms of the building great and small on the four floors are exquisitely finished and furnished all made as attractive as possible that those of both sexes who are weary and broken in mind may have much to interest them in their long days of absence from home and friends students of the national art training school under mr poynter did much of the art work there are no blank walls the holloway sanatorium which is five hundred feet by two hundred feet in extent has a model laundry in a separate building pretty red brick houses for the staff and those who are not obliged to sleep in the building a pleasureouse for rest and recreation for the inmates and a handsome chapel four hundred or more patients can be accommodated a moderate charge is made for those who can afford to pay and only those persons thought to be curable are received as much freedom is allowed as possible that the inmates may not unnecessarily feel the surveillance under which they are obliged to live the sanatorium was opened june by the prince of wales accompanied by the princess their three daughters and the duke of cambridge mr martin holloway the brothernaw of mr thomas holloway spoke of the uses of the sanatorium and the prince of wales replied in a happy manner many inmates were received at once and the institution has proved a great blessing to what other uses should mr holloway put his large fortune he and mrs holloway had long thought of a college for women and after her death he determined to build one as a memorial to her who had helped him through all those days of poverty and selfacrifice in mr holloway held a conference with the blind professor henry fawcett member of parliament and his able wife mrs millicent garrett fawcett mr samuel morley p sir james kayhuttleworth bart mr david chadwick p dr hague of new york and others interested in the higher education of women mr holloway foresaw with these educators that in the future women would seek a university education like their brothers for many years says mr martin holloway his mind was dominated by the idea that if a higher form of education would ennoble women the sons of such mothers would be nobler men on may mr holloway purchased and conveyed in trust to mr henry driver holloway and mr george martin holloway his brothernaw and mr david chadwick p ninetyive acres on the southern slope of egham hill surrey for his college for women it is in the midst of most picturesque and beautiful scenery rich in historical associations egham is five miles from windsor near the thames and on the borders of runnymede so called from the saxon runemede or council meadow where the barons june compelled king john to sign the magna charta a building was erected to commemorate this important event and the table on which the charter was signed is still preserved near by is windsor great park with seven thousand fallow deer in its eighteen hundred acres and its noted long walk an avenue of elms three miles in length extending from the gateway of george the principal entrance to windsor castle to snow hill crowned by a statue of george by westmacott not far away from egham are lovely virginia water and staines from stana the saxon for stone where one sees the city boundary stone on which is inscribed god preserve the city of london a this marks the limit of jurisdiction of the lord mayor of london over the thames after mr holloway had decided to build his college he visited the chief cities of europe with mr martin holloway to ascertain what was possible about the best institutions of learning and the latter made a personal inspection of colleges in the united states mr holloway was seventyix and too old for a long journey to america plans were prepared by mr w h crossland of london who spent much time in france studying the old french ch teaux before he began his work on the college the first brick was laid sept mr holloway wished this structure to be the best of its kind in england if not in the world the annual register says in regard to mr holloway two great gifts when their efficiency or adornment was concerned his customary principle of economy failed to restrain him the college is a magnificent building in the style of the french renaissance reminding one of the louvre in paris of red brick with portland stone dressings with much artistic sculpture it covers says a report prepared by the college authorities more ground than any other college in the world and forms a double quadrangle measuring feet by feet the general design is that of two long lofty blocks running parallel to each other and connected in the middle and at either end by lower cross buildings the quadrangles each measure about feet by feet cloisters run from east to west on two sides of each quadrangle with roofs whose upper sides are constructed as terraces the capitals being arranged as triplets no pains or expense have been spared to finish and furnish this college with every comfort even luxury there are over rooms and accommodations for about students each person has two rooms one for sleeping and one for study and there is a sittingoom for every six persons the diningall is feet long wide and high the semiircular ceiling is richly ornamented the recreationall which is in reality a pictureallery is feet long wide and high with beautiful ceiling and floor of polished marquetry the pictures here were collected by mr martin holloway and cost about or half a million dollars sir edwin landseer famous picture man proposes god disposes was purchased for it was painted in by landseer who received for it it

large swimmingath a lecture theatre museum a library with carved oak bookcases reaching nearly to the ceiling and an immense kitchen which serves for a school for cookery electric lights and steam heat are used throughout the buildings and there are open fireplaces for the students rooms the chapel feet long by feet wide says the london graphic for july is a singularly elaborate building in the renaissance style in its decoration a strong tendency to the italian school of the latter part of the sixteenth century is apparent this is especially the case with the roof which bears a kind of resemblance to that of the sistine chapel at rome though it cannot in any way be said to be a copy of that magnificent work the choir or nave is seated with oak benches arranged stallays as is usual in the college chapels of oxford and cambridge the roof is formed of an elliptic barrelault the lower portions of which are adorned with statues and candelabra in high relief and the upper portion by painted enrichments the former are a very remarkable series of works by the italian sculpture fucigna who had learned his art in the studios of tenerani and rauch at rome these were his last works and he did not live to complete them the figures represent the prophets and other personages from the old testament on the left side and apostles evangelists and saints from the new testament on the right the baldachino is constructed of walnut and oak richly carved and the organ front at the opposite end of the chapel is a beautiful example of woodarving the building and furnishing of the college cost the endowment the pictures making in all about one million sterling or five million dollars the deed of foundation states that the college is founded by the advice and counsel of the founder dear wife when mrs holloway was toiling with her husband over the shop in the strand with no recreation during the week except a walk as he said in that crowded thoroughfare how little she could have realized that this beautiful monument would be built to her memory mr holloway did not live to see his college completed as he died after a brief illness of bronchitis at tittenhurst wednesday dec aged eightyhree and was buried in st michael churchyard sunninghill jan mr martin holloway faithfully carried out his relative wishes and when the college was ready for occupancy it was opened by queen victoria in person on wednesday june the day was fine and egham was gayly decorated for the event with flowers banners and arches the queen with princess beatrice and her husband the late prince henry of battenberg the duke of connaught and other members of the royal family drove over from windsor through frogmore where prince albert is buried and runnymede to egham in open carriages each carriage drawn by four gray horses ridden by postilions outriders in scarlet preceded the procession which was accompanied by an escort of life guards reaching the college at p the queen and princess beatrice were each presented with a bouquet by miss driver holloway and were conducted to the chapel where a throne had been prepared for her majesty princess beatrice prince henry of battenberg and the duke of cambridge stood on her left with the duke of connaught the archbishop of canterbury and others on her right the choir sang an ode composed by mr martin holloway and the archbishop of canterbury offered prayer the queen then admired the decorations of the chapel and proceeded to the picture gallery where the architect presented to her an album with illustrations of the college and the contractor mr j thompson offered her a beautiful key of gold the top of the stem is encircled by two rows of diamonds and the bow at the top is an elegant piece of gold enamel and diamonds a laurel wreath of diamonds surrounds the words opened by h the queen june the queen was then conducted to the upper quadrangle where she seated herself in a chair of state on a dais under a canopy of crimson velvet a great concourse of people were gathered to witness the formal opening of the college the lawn was also crowded six hundred children being among the people after the band of the royal artillery played to the singing of the national anthem god save the queen mr martin holloway presented an address to her majesty in a beautiful casket of gold the casket rests on four pediments on each of which is seated a female figure says the london times which are emblematical of education science music and painting on the front panel is a view of royal holloway college on either side of which is a medallion containing the royal and imperial monogram r i executed in colored enamel underneath the view is the monogram of the founder mr thomas holloway in enamel at one end of the casket are the royal arms and at the opposite end the holloway arms and motto nil desperandum richly emblazoned in enamel the casket is surmounted by a portrait model of mr holloway seated in a classic chair being a reduction from the model from life taken by signor fucigna after the address in the casket was presented to queen victoria the earl of kimberley the minister in attendance stepped forward and said i am commanded by her majesty to declare the college open trumpets were blown by the royal scots greys cheers were given the archbishop pronounced the benediction and the choir sang rule britannia the queen before her departure expressed her pleasure and satisfaction in the arrangement of the institution and commanded that it be styled the royal holloway college more than a year later on friday dec a statue of the queen was unveiled in the upper quadrangle of the college by prince christian a group of the founder and his wife in the lower quadrangle was also unveiled both statues are of tyrolese marble and are the work of prince victor of hohenloheangenburg the rt hon earl granville k g made a very interesting address the college has done admirable work during the ten years since its opening the founder desired that ultimately the college should confer degrees but at present the students qualify for degrees at existing universities in the report for of miss bishop the principal she says we have now among our students past and present fiftyne graduates of the university of london twentyne in honor and twentyne students who have obtained oxford university honors this is the second year that a holloway student has won the gilchrist medal which is awarded to the first woman on the london b a list provided she obtains twohirds of the possible marks in a holloway student was graduated from the royal university of ireland with honors students are received who do not wish to work for a university examination provided they are bona fide students with a definite course of work in view says the college report for they must be over seventeen pass an entrance examination and remain not less than one year there are twelve entrance scholarships of the value of to a year and twelve founder scholarships of a year besides bursaries of the same value the charge for board lodging and instruction is or a year courses of practical instruction are given in cookery ambulanceork sickursing woodarving and dressmaking mr holloway states in his deed the curriculum of the college shall not be such as to discourage students who desire a liberal education apart from the greek and latin languages and proficiency in classics shall not entitle students to rewards of merit over others equally proficient in other branches of knowledge while the governors some of whom rightly must always be women may provide instruction in subjects which seem most suitable mr holloway expresses his sensible belief that the education of women should not be exclusively regulated by the traditions and methods of former ages the students at holloway according to an article in harper bazar march by miss elizabeth barney have a happy as well as busy life she says the girls have a runninglub which requires an entrance examination of each candidate for election the test being a rousing sprint around the college nehird of a mile ithin three minutes or fail after this has been successfully passed the condition of continued membership is a repetition of this performance eight times every two weeks on pain of a penny fine for every run neglected on stormy days the interior corridors are not a bad course inasmuch as each one measures oneenth of a mile in length nor are inoor amusements less in vogue than outoor sports there are the hakespeare evenings and the rench evenings the ire brigade and the ebating society and a host of other more or less social events the debating society is an august body which holds its sittings in the lecture theatre and deals with all the questions of the united kingdom in the most irreproachable parliamentary style they divide into government and opposition and pass and reject bills in a way which would do credit to the nation in parliament assembled the girls also she says have a string orchestra of violins and elli numbering about fifteen performers the girls meet one evening a week in the library for practice and enter into it more as recreation before study than as serious work they play very well indeed together and sometimes give concerts for the rest of the college a writer in the atlanta constitution for april thus describes the drill of the fair fire brigade he holloway volunteer brigade formed in three sections of ten students each representing the occupants of different floors they were drawn up in line at ight turn quick march position then each section went quite through with two full drills a fire in sittingoom no was supposed at command et to work the engine was run down to the doorway a hain of recruits was formed to the nearest source of waterupply and the buckets were handed in line that the engine might be kept in full play the pump was vigorously applied by two girls while another worked the small hose quickly and ingeniously so that the engine was at full speed in less than a minute when the drill was concluded with the orders nock off and ake up everything had been put in its own place then came the ydrant drill which was conducted at the hydrant nearest the point of a supposed outbreak of fire in this six students from each section took part directly the alarm was given one hundred feet of canvas hose was run out and an additional length regulated of course by the distanc was joined to it at the words urn on by the officer known as ranch hoseman the hose was directed so that had there been water in it it must have streamed onto the supposed fire this drill was also accomplished in only a minute and at the commands nock off and ake up the hoseipes were promptly disconnected the pipe that is always kept attached to the hydrant was laked down and an extra one hundred feet oiled up on the bight with astonishing rapidity the drills are genuine realities and the students thoroughly enjoy them there is also a way of escape for the students in case of fire the merryweather chute a large tube of specially woven fireroof canvas is attached to a wroughtron frame that fits the window opening there is also a drill with this chute when the word is given make ready to go down chute the young woman draws her dress around her steps feet foremost into the tube and regulates her speed by means of a rope made fast to the frame and running through the chute to the ground fifty students can descend from a window in five minutes with no fear after they have practised mr holloway and his wife worked hard to accumulate their fortune but they placed it where it will do great good for centuries to come in so doing they made for themselves an honored name and lasting remembrance charles pratt and his institute it is a good thing to be famous provided that the fame has been honestly won it is a good thing to be rich when the image and superscription of god is recognized on every coin but the sweetest thing in the world is to be loved the tears that were shed over the coffin of charles pratt welled up out of loving hearts i count his death to have been the sorest bereavement brooklyn has ever suffered for he was yet in his vigorous prime with large plans and possibilities yet to be accomplished charles pratt belonged to the only true nobility in america he men who do not inherit a great name but make one for themselves thus wrote the rev dr theodore cuyler of brooklyn after mr pratt death in charles pratt the founder of pratt institute was born at watertown mass oct his father asa pratt a cabinetaker had ten children to support so that it became necessary for each child to earn for himself whenever that was possible illustration charles pratt when charles was ten years old he left home and found a place to labor on a neighboring farm for three years the lad slight in physique but ambitious to earn worked faithfully and was allowed to attend school three months in each winter at thirteen he was eager for a broader field and going to boston was employed for a year in a grocery store soon after he went to newton and there learned the machinist trade saving every cent carefully because he had a plan in his mind and that plan was to get an education even if a meagre one that he might do something in the world finally he had saved enough for a year schooling and going to wilbraham academy at wilbraham mass managed as he afterwards said to live on one dollar a week while i studied fifty dollars helped to lay the foundation for a remarkably useful and noble life when the year was over and the money spent having learned already the value of depending upon himself rather than upon outside help the youth became a clerk in a paintndil store in boston here the thirst for knowledge stimulated but only partially satisfied by the short year at the academy led him to the poor man blessing he library here he could read and think and be far removed from evil associations when he was twentyne in charles pratt went to new york as a clerk for messrs schanck downing fulton street in the oil paint and glass business the work was constant but he was happy in it because he believed that work should be the duty and pleasure of all he never changed in this love for labor he said years afterwards when he was worth millions i am convinced that the great problem which we are trying to solve is very much wrapped up in the thought of educating the people to find happiness in a busy active life and that the occupation of the hour is of more importance than the wages received he found happiness in a busy active life when he was earning fifty dollars a year as well as when he was a man of great wealth years later mr pratt son charles relates the following incident which occurred when his father came to visit him at amherst college he was present at a lecture to the senior class in mental science the subject incidentally discussed was ork its necessary drain upon the vital forces and its natural and universal distastefulness on being asked to address the class my father assumed to present the matter from a point of view entirely different from that of the textook and maintained that there was no inherent reason why man should consider his daily labor of whatever nature as necessarily disagreeable and burdensome but that the right view was the one which made of work a delight a source of real satisfaction and even pleasure such indeed it was to him he believed it might prove to be such to all others after mr pratt had worked three years for his new york firm in connection with two other gentlemen he bought the paintndil business of his employers and the new firm became raynolds devoe pratt for thirteen years he worked untiringly at his business and in the firm was divided the oil portion of the business being carried on by charles pratt co in the midst of this busy life the influence of the mercantile library of boston was not lost he had become associated with the mercantile library of new york and both this and the one in boston had a marked influence on his life and his great gifts when the immense oilields of pennsylvania began to be developed about mr pratt was one of the first to see the possibilities of the petroleum trade he began to refine the crude oil and succeeded in producing probably the best upon the market called pratt astral oil mr pratt took a just pride in its wide use and was pleased says a friend when the rev dr buckley told him that he had found that the russian convent on mount tabor was lighted with pratt astral oil he meant that the stamp ratt should be like the stamp of the mint n assurance of quality and quantity for years he was one of the officers of the standard oil company and of course a sharer in its enormous wealth nothing seemed more improbable when he was spending a year at wilbraham academy living on a dollar a week than this ownership of millions now as then he was saving of time as well as money says mr james mcgee of new york he brought to business a hatred of waste he disliked waste of every kind he was not willing that the smallest material should be lost he did not believe in letting time go to waste he was punctual at his engagements or gave good excuse for his tardiness speaking of an evening spent in congratulations he said that it was time lost it would have been better spent in reviewing mistakes that they might be corrected it is said that a youth who had hurried into business applied to mr pratt for advice as to whether he should go west he questioned the young man as to how he occupied his time what he did before business hours and what after what he was reading or doing to improve his mind finding that the young man was taking no pains to educate himself he said emphatically o don go west they don want you active as mr pratt was in the details of a great business he found time for other work desiring an education which he in his early days could not obtain he provided the best for his children he became deeply interested in adelphi academy brooklyn was a trustee and later president of the board in he erected the wing of the main building and six years later in he gave for the erection of a new building he gave generously to the baptist church in brooklyn in which he worshipped and from the pews of which he was seldom absent on the sabbath he bestowed thousands upon struggling churches he generously aided rochester theological seminary he gave to amherst college through his son charles pratt about for a gymnasium and through his son frederick b pratt thirteen acres for athletic grounds he helped foreign missions and missions at home with an open hand there were says dr cuyler innumerable little rills of benevolence that trickled into the homes of the needy and the hearts of the straitened and suffering i never loved charles pratt more than when he was dealing with the needs of a bright orphan girl whose case appealed strongly to his sympathies after inquiring into it carefully he said to me e must be careful when trying to aid this young lady not to cripple her energies or lower her sense of independence the last time his hand ever touched paper was to sign a generous check for the benefit of our brooklyn bureau of charities almost the last words that he ever wrote was this characteristic sentence feel that life is so short that i am not satisfied unless i do each day the best i can mr pratt was not willing to spend his life in accumulating millions except for a purpose he once told dr cuyler the greatest humbug in this world is the idea that the mere possession of money can make any man happy i never got any satisfaction out of mine until i began to do good with it he did not wish his wealth to build fine mansions for himself for he preferred to live simply he had no pleasure in display he needed says his minister dr humpstone neither club nor playhouse to afford him rest his home sufficed for those who use such diversions he had no criticism in these matters he was neither narrow nor ascetic he was the brother of his own children his home was to him the fairest spot on earth he filled it with sunshine outside of his business his church and his philanthropy it was his only sphere he was a man of few words and much selfontrol dr humpstone relates this incident told him by a friend some one made upon mr pratt openly a bitter personal attack the future revealed that this charge was entirely unmerited and the man who made it lived to regret his act but the moment revealed the greatness of our dead friend love he said no word only a face pale with pain revealed how determined was his effort at selfontrol and how keen was his suffering when his accuser turned to go he bade him goodorning as though he had left a blessing and not a bane behind him as i recall the past at this moment i think of no word he ever spoke in my hearing that was proof of an unloving spirit in him for years mr pratt had been thinking about industrial education such education as enables men and women to earn their own living by applied knowledge and the skilful use of their hands in the various productive industries he knew that the majority of young men and women are born poor and must struggle for a livelihood and whether poor or rich ought to know how to be selfupporting and not helpless members of the community the study of algebra and english literature might be a delight but not all can be teachers or clerks in stores some must be machinists carpenters and skilled workmen in various trades mr pratt never forgot that he had been a poor boy he never grew cold in manner and selfish in life he presented says mr james macalister president of the drexel institute philadelphia the rare spectacle of a rich man in strong sympathy with the industrial revolution that was progressing around him his ardent desire was to recognize labor to improve it to elevate it and his own experience taught him that the best way to do this was to put education into the handiwork of the laborer mr pratt gained information from all possible sources about the kind of an institution which should be built to provide the knowledge of books and the knowledge of earning a living he travelled widely in his own country corresponded with the heads of various schools such as the rose polytechnic institute at terre haute ind the institute of technology in boston and with dr john eaton then commissioner of education dr felix adler of new york and others then mr pratt took his son mr f b pratt and his private secretary mr heffley to twenty of the leading cities in england france austria switzerland and germany to see what the old world was doing to educate her people in selfelp he found great industrial schools on the continent supported by the city or state where every boy or girl could learn the theory or practice or both of the trade to be followed for a livelihood on leaving the schools the pupils could earn a dollar or more a day our own country was sadly backward in such matters the public schools had introduced manual training only to a very limited extent mr pratt determined to build an institute where any who wished to engage in mechanical commercial and artistic pursuits should have a thorough theoretic and practical knowledge it should dignify labor because he believed there should be no idlers among rich or poor it should teach that personal character is of greater consequence than material productions mr pratt on sept bought a large piece of land on ryerson street brooklyn a total of square feet and began to carry out in brick and stone his noble thought for the people he not only gave his millions but he gave his time and thought in the midst of his busy life he said the giving which counts is the giving of one self the faithful teacher who gives his strength and life without stint or hope of reward other than the sense of fidelity to duty gives most and so the record will stand when our books are closed at the day of final accounting mr pratt at first erected the main building six stories high feet by brick with terraotta and stone trimmings and the machinehop buildings consisting of metalorking and woodorking shops forge and foundry rooms and a building feet by for bricklaying stonearving plumbing and the like later the highchool building was added and a library building has recently been erected the library having outgrown its rooms in the main building occupying the whole fourth floor as well as parts of several other floors is the art department of the institute here in morning afternoon and evening classes under the best instructors a three years course in art may be taken in drawing painting and clayodelling also courses in architectural and mechanical drawing where in the adjacent shops the properties of materials and their power to bear strain can be learned many students take a course in design and are thus enabled to win good positions as designers of bookovers tiles wallapers carpets etc the normal art course of two years fits for teaching of those who left the institute between and having finished the course seventyix became supervisors of drawing in public schools or teach art elsewhere with salaries aggregating courses are also given in woodarving and art needlework though there were but twelve in the class in the art department at the opening of the institute in in three years the number of pupils had increased to about seven hundred mr pratt instituted another department in the main building hat of domestic science there are morning afternoon and evening classes in sewing cooking and other household matters a year course two lessons a week is given in dressmaking cutting fitting and draping or the course may be taken in six months if time is limited a course in millinery with five lessons a week and the full course in three months if the person has little time to give lectures in hygiene and home nursing that women in their homes may know what to do in cases of sickness classes in laundry work in plain and fancy cooking and preparing food for invalids there are normal courses to fit teachers for schools and colleges to give instruction in house sanitation ventilation heating cooking etc this department of domestic science has been most useful and popular as many as pupils have been enrolled in a single year a club of men came to take lessons in cooking preparatory to campife nurses come from the trainingchools in hospitals to learn how to cook for invalids many teachers have gone out from this department the institute has not been able to supply the demand for sewingomen and dressmakers during the busy season mr pratt rightly thought that a knowledge of household employments is thoroughly consistent with the grace and dignity and true womanliness of every american girl the housewife who knows how to manage the details of her home has more courage than one who is dependent upon servants no matter how faithful they may be she is a better mistress for she can sympathize with them and appreciate their work when well done mr pratt had another object in view as he said to help those families who must live on small incomes ay not over or per year eaching the best disposition of this money in wise purchase economical use of material and little waste one aim of this department is to make the home of the workingman more attractive mr pratt said in the last address which he ever made to his institute home is the centre from which the life of the nation emanates and the highest product of modern civilization is a contented happy home how can we help to secure such homes by teaching the people that happiness to some extent at least consists in having something to occupy the head and hand and in doing some useful work in the department of commerce there are day and evening classes in phonography typewriting bookkeeping commercial law german and spanish as the latter language it is believed will be used more in our commercial relations in the future there is a department of music to encourage singing among the people with courses in vocal music and in the art of teaching music this has over four hundred students in the department of kindergartens in the institute mr pratt took a deep interest a model kindergarten is conducted with traininglasses and classes for mothers who may thus be able to introduce it into their homes the highchool department a four years course combining the academic and the manual training has proved very valuable it was originally intended to make the institute purely manual but later it was felt to be wise to give an opportunity for a completer education by combining headork and handork the school day is from nine olock till three of the seven periods into which this time is divided three are devoted to recitations one to study he lessons are prepared at home ne to drawing and two to the workshop in wood forging tinsmithing machineool work etc when the high school was opened mr pratt said we believe in the value of coducation and are pleased to note the addition of more than twenty young women to this entering class the high school has some excellent methods for making the machinery of national and state elections clear says mr f b pratt the secretary of the institute and son of the founder the school has conducted a campaign and election in close imitation of the actual process every morning the important news of the preceding day has been announced and explained by selected pupils the institute annually awards ten scholarships to ten graduates of the brooklyn grammar schools five boys and five girls who pass the best entrance examinations for the high school of pratt institute the pupils after leaving the high school are fitted to enter any scientific institution of college grade mr pratt was so much impressed with the fareaching influence of good books as distributed through a free library that he established a library in the institute for the use of the pupils and for the public as well it now has fifty thousand volumes with a circulation of over two hundred thousand volumes in connection with it there are library traininglasses graduates of which have found good positions in various libraries a museum was begun by mr pratt in as an aid to the students in their work the finest specimens of glass earthenware bronzes ironork and minerals were obtained from the old world specimens of iron and steel from our own country to illustrate their manufacture in the various articles of use much attention will be given to artistic work in iron after the manner of quentin matsys lace ancient and modern all common cloth with kind of weave and price various wools and woollen goods from many countries in the basement of the main building mr pratt opened a lunchoom a most sensible department especially for those who live at some distance from the institute dinners at a reasonable price are served from twelve to two olock and suppers three nights a week from six to seven p over forty thousand meals are served yearly soups cold meats salads sandwiches tea coffee milk and fruit are usually offered another thought of mr pratt who seemed not to overlook anything was the establishing of an association known as the thrift mr pratt said pupils are taught some useful work by which they can earn money it seems a natural thing that the next step should be to endeavor to teach them how to save this money or in other words how to make a wise use of it it is not enough that one be trained so that he can join the bands of the world workers and become a producer he needs quite as much to learn habits of economy and thrift in order to make his life a success the thrift was divided into the investment branch and the loan branch the investment shares were payable at the rate of one dollar a month for ten years the investor would then have any person could loan money to purchase a home and make small monthly payments instead of rent as many persons were unable to save a dollar a month stamps were sold as in europe and a person could buy them at any time and these could be redeemed for cash in less than four years the thrift had depositors with a total investment of over twentyour loans had been made aggregating over the total deposits up to were most interesting to me of all the departments of pratt institute are the machinehops and the trade school building where boys can learn a trade the aim of these trade classes says mr f b pratt in the independent for april is to afford a thorough grounding in the principles of a mechanical trade and sufficient practice in its different operations to produce a fair amount of hand skill the old apprenticeship system has been abandoned and our boys must learn to earn a living in some other way the trades taught at pratt institute are carpentry forging machineork plastering plumbing blacksmithing bricklaying house and fresco painting etc there is an evening class of sheetetal workers who study patterns for cornices elbows and other designs in sheetetal much attention is given to electrical construction and to electricity in general the day and evening classes are always full some of the masterechanics associations are cordial in their coperation and examination of students through their committees after leaving the institute work seems to be readily obtained at good wages mr pratt wished the instruction here to be of the best he said the demand is for a better and better quality of work and our american artisans must learn that to claim first place in any trade they must be intelligent they must learn to have pride in their work and to love it and believe in our motto e true to your work and your work will be true to you the sons of the founder are alive to the necessities of the young in this direction if it is true that out of the white male prisoners in the prisons and reformatory institutions of the united states in nearly threeourths were native born and had learned no trade whatever it is evident that one of the most pressing needs of our time is the teaching of trades to boys and young men mr charles pratt the president of the institute says in his founder day address in concerning technical instruction our possible service here seems almost limitless the president of the board of education of boston in a recent address congratulated his fellowitizens upon the fact that boston has her system of public schools and kindergartens and now and but lately her public school of manual training but what is needed he said s a school of technical training in the trades such as pratt institute and other similar institutions furnish i sincerely trust that the next five years of life and growth here will develop much in this direction we are willing to enlarge our present special facilities or provide new ones for new tradelass requirements as long as the demand for such opportunities truly exists one rejoices in such institutions as the new york trade schools on first avenue between sixtyeventh and sixtyighth streets with their day and evening classes in plumbing gasfitting bricklaying plastering stoneutting frescoainting woodarving carpentry and the like a printing department has also been added this work owes its inception and success to the brain and devotion of the late lamented richard tylden auchmuty who died in new york july mrs auchmuty the wife of the founder has given the land and buildings to the school valued at and a buildingund of mr j pierpont morgan has endowed the school with a gift of mr pratt did not cease working when his great institute was fairly started he built in greenpoint long island a large apartment building called the astral five stories high of brick and stone with suites of rooms each suite capable of accommodating from three to six persons the building cost and is rented to workingmen and their families the income to be used in helping to maintain the institute a public library was opened in the astral with the thought at first of using it only for the people in the building but it was soon opened to all the inhabitants of greenpoint and has been most heartily appreciated and used cut in stone over the fireplace in the readingoom of the astral are the words waste neither time nor money when mr pratt made his first address to the students of pratt institute on founder day oct his birthday taking the bible from the desk he said before reading it and offering prayer whatever i have done whatever i hope to do i have done trusting in the power from above before he built the institute many persons asked him to use his wealth in other ways some urged a theological school others a medical school but his interest in the workingman and the home led him to found the institute he rejoiced in the work and its outlook for the future he said i am so grateful so grateful that the almighty has inclined my heart to do this thing on the second and third founder days mr pratt spoke with hope and the deepest interest in the work of the institute he had been asked often what he had spent for the work and had prepared a statement at considerable cost of time but with characteristic modesty he could never bring himself to make it public i have asked myself over and over again what good could result from any statement we could make of the amount of money we have spent the quality and amount of service rendered by the institute is the only fair estimate of its real value in closing his address mr pratt said to my sons and corustees who will have this work to carry on when i am gone i wish to say he world will overestimate your ability and will underestimate the value of your work will be exacting of every promise made or implied will be critical of your failings will often misjudge your motives and hold you to strict account for all your doings many pupils will make demands and be forgetful of your service to them ingratitude will often be your reward when the day is dark and full of discouragement and difficulty you will need to look on the other side of the picture which you will find full of hope and gladness when the next founder day came mr pratt was gone and the institute was in the hands of others at the close of a day of work and thought in his new york office mr pratt fell at his post may and was carried to his home in clinton avenue brooklyn after the funeral may memorial services were held in the emmanuel baptist church on sunday afternoon may with addresses by distinguished men who loved and honored him a beautiful memorial chapel was erected by his family on his estate at dosoris glen cove long island and there the body of mr pratt was buried july the chapel is of granite in the romanesque style with exquisite stained glass windows the main room is wainscoted with polished red granite the arching ceiling lined with glass mosaic in blue gold and green at the farther end in a semiircular apse reached by two steps through an imposing arch stands the sarcophagus of siena marble with the name charles pratt and dates of birth and death the campanile contains the chime of bells so admired by everybody who visited the columbian exposition at chicago and heard it ring out from the central clock tower in the building of manufactures and liberal arts few comparatively will ever see this monument erected by a devoted family to a husband and father but thousands upon thousands will see the monument which mr pratt built for himself in his noble institute every year thousands come to learn its methods and to copy some of its features even from africa and south america the earl of meath who has done so much for the improvement of his race said to dr cuyler of all the good things i have seen in america there is none that i would so like to carry back to london as this splendid establishment one may read in baedeker guide book of the united states instructions how to find the extensive buildings of pratt institute one of the bestquipped technical institutions in the world none interested in technical education should fail to visit this institution during his life mr pratt gave to the institute about and thus had the pleasure of seeing it bear fruit of this is the endowment fund small charges are made to the pupils but not nearly enough to pay the running expenses mr pratt sons are nobly carrying forward the work left to their care by their father who died in the midst of his labors playgrounds have been laid out a gymnasium provided new buildings erected and other measures adopted which they feel that their father would approve were he alive courses of free lectures are given at pratt institute to the public as well as the students a summer school is provided at glen cove long island for such as wish to learn about agriculture with instruction given in botany chemistry physiology raising and harvesting crops and the care of animals nurses are trained in the care and development of children a bright monthly magazine is published by the institute a neighborship association has been formed of alumni teachers and pupils which meets for the discussion of such topics as the relation of the rich to the poor the ethics of giving citizenship etc and to carry out the work and spirit of the institute wherever opportunity offers already the influence of pratt institute has been very great public schools all over the country are adopting some form of manual training whereby the pupils shall be better fitted to earn their living mr chas pratt in one of his founder day addresses quotes the words of a successful teacher and merchant there is nothing under god heaven so important to the individual as to acquire the power to earn his own living to be able to stand alone if necessary to be dependent upon no one to be indispensable to some one about four thousand students receive instruction each year at the institute many go out as teachers to other schools all over the country as the founder said in his last address the world goes on and pratt institute if it fulfils the hopes and expectations of its founder must go on and as the years pass the field of its influence should grow wider and wider on the day that he died mr herbert s adams the sculptor had finished a bust of mr pratt in clay it was put into bronze by the teachers and pupils and now stands in the institute with these words of the founder cut in the bronze the giving which counts is the giving of one self thomas guy and his hospital one day the rich matthew vassar stood before the great london hospital founded by thomas guy and read these words on the pedestal of the bronze statue thomas guy sole founder of this hospital in his lifetime a the last three words made a deep impression matthew vassar had no children he wished to leave his fortune where it would be of permanent value and lest something might happen to thwart his plan he had to do it in his lifetime sir isaac newton said they who give nothing till they die never give at all several years before his death matthew vassar built vassar college near poughkeepsie n y for he said there is not in our country there is not in the world so far as known a single fully endowed institution for the education of women it is my hope to be the instrument in the hands of providence of founding and perpetuating an institution which shall accomplish for young women what our colleges are accomplishing for young men to this end he gave a million dollars and was happy in the results his birthday is celebrated each year as founder day on one of these occasions he said this is almost more happiness than i can bear this one day more than repays me for all i have done and what of thomas guy whose example led to matthew vassar noble gift while the latter was alive he was an economical selfade bookbinder and bookseller who became the greatest philanthropist of his day thomas guy was born in horselydown southwark in the outskirts of london in or his father thomas guy was a lighterman and coalmonger one who transferred coal from the colliers to the wharves and also sold it to customers he was a member of the carpenters company of the city of london and probably owned some barges his wife anne vaughton belonged to a family of better social position than her husband as several of her relatives had been mayors in tamworth or held other offices of influence when the boy thomas was eight years old his father died leaving mrs guy to bring up three small children thomas john and anne the eldest probably went to the free grammar school of tamworth and when fifteen or sixteen years of age was apprenticed for eight years to john clarke the younger bookseller and bookbinder in cheapside london john clarke was ruined in the great fire of sept which says h r fox bourne in his london merchants destroyed eightyine churches and more than thirteen thousand houses in four hundred streets of the whole district within the city walls four hundred and thirtyix acres were in ruins and only seventyive acres were left covered property worth was wasted and thousands of starving londoners had to run for their lives and crouch for days and weeks on the bare fields of islington and hampstead southwark and lambeth what thomas guy was in his later life he probably was as a boy ardorking economical of good habits and determined to succeed when the eight years of apprenticeship were over he was admitted a freeman of the stationers company and having a little means he began a business at the junction of cornhill and lombard streets where he resided through his whole life his stock of books at the beginning was worth about two hundred pounds at this time many english bibles were printed in holland on account of the better paper and types found there and vast numbers were imported to england with large profits young guy with business shrewdness soon became an importer of bibles and very probably prayerooks and psalms the king printers were opposed to such importations and caused the arrest of booksellers and publishers so that this holland trade was largely broken up it is said that the king printers so raised the price of bibles that the poor were unable to buy them the privilege of printing was limited to london york and the universities of oxford and cambridge then london and oxford quarrelled over bible printing and each tried to undersell the other illustration thomas guy thomas guy and peter parker printed bibles for oxford had four presses in use within four months of their undertaking the oxford work and showed the greatest activity skill and energy in the enterprise their work was excellent and some of their bibles and other volumes are still found in the english libraries these university printers parker guy had many lawsuits with other firms who claimed that the former had made or even by their connection with oxford doubtless they had made money but they had done their work well and deserved their success concerning oxford bibles a writer in mcclure magazine says in these days the privilege of printing a bible is hardly less jealously guarded in the united kingdom than the privilege of printing a banknote it is accorded by license to the queen printers and by charter to the universities of oxford and cambridge and it is as a matter of fact at the university of oxford that the greatest bulk of the work is done from this famous press there issue annually about one million copies of the sacred book copies ranging in price from tenpence to ten pounds and in form from the brilliant bible which weighs in its most handsome binding less than four ounces and measures by by inches to the superb folio bible for church use the page of which measures by inches which is the only folio bible in existence eventyight editions in all copies in all manner of languages even the most barbarous the choicest paper is used and the utmost care taken with setting the type it is computed that to set up and read a reference bible costs the first step is to make a careful calculation showing what in the particular type employed will be the exact contents of each page from the first page to the last it must be known before a single type is set just what will be the first and last word on each page it is not enough that this calculation shall be approximate it must be exact to the syllable the proofs are then read again by a fresh reader from a fresh model and this process is repeated until before being electrotyped they have been read five times in all any compositor who detects an error in the model gets a reward but only two such rewards have ever been earned any member of the public who is first to detect an error in the authorized text is entitled to one guinea but the average annual outlay of the press under this head is almost nil as soon as thomas guy prospered he gave to various causes he gave five pounds to help rebuild the schoolhouse at tamworth where he had been a student a few years before and when a little over thirty years of age in he bought some land in tamworth and erected an almshouse for seven poor women a goodized room was used for their library the whole cost was a worthy beginning for a young man a little later mr guy gave ten pounds yearly to a spinning school where the children of the poor were taught how to work probably some kind of industrial training also ten pounds yearly to a dissenting minister and the same amount to one of the established church when mr guy was a little over forty he gave another for almshouses for poor men at tamworth and the town called him our incomparable benefactor when mr guy was fortyive years of age in he attempted to enter parliament from tamworth but was defeated this was the second parliament under william and mary in he was elected sheriff of london but refused to serve perhaps on account of the expense as he disliked display and paid the penalty of refusing in the third parliament mr guy tried again and succeeded he was relected after an exciting contest in and again in and and in two parliaments under queen anne while in parliament he built a town hall for the people of tamworth in after thirteen years of service mr guy was rejected it is said that he promised the people of tamworth so much did he enjoy parliamentary life that if they would elect him again he would leave his whole fortune to the town so they should never have a pauper but for once they forgot their incomparable benefactor and thomas guy in turn forgot them the cause of guy rejection says the history of tamworth is said to have been his neglect of the gastronomic propensities of his worthy patriotic and enlightened constituents by whom the virtues of fasting appear to have been entirely forgotten in the anger of the moment he threatened to pull down the town hall which he had built and
