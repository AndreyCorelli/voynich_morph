rebelled against this measure with a beloved wife depending on him for support inaction itself could have procured him little rest his case seemed hard his prospects of innocent felicity had been too banefully obscured yet in this painful and difficult position he did not yield to despondency and at length assistance and partial deliverance reached him from a very unexpected quarter schiller had not long been sick when the hereditary prince now reigning duke of holsteinugustenburg jointly with the count von schimmelmann conferred on him a pension of a thousand crowns for three years no stipulation was added but merely that he should be careful of his health and use every attention to recover this speedy and generous aid moreover was presented with a delicate politeness which as schiller said touched him more than even the gift itself we should remember this count and this duke they deserve some admiration and some envy footnote it was to denmark likewise that klopstock owed the means of completing his messias this disorder introduced a melancholy change into schiller circumstances he had now another enemy to strive with a secret and fearful impediment to vanquish in which much resolute effort must be sunk without producing any positive result pain is not entirely synonymous with evil but bodily pain seems less redeemed by good than almost any other kind of it from the loss of fortune of fame or even of friends philosophy pretends to draw a certain compensating benefit but in general the permanent loss of health will bid defiance to her alchymy it is a universal diminution the diminution equally of our resources and of our capacity to guide them a penalty unmitigated save by love of friends which then first becomes truly dear and precious to us or by comforts brought from beyond this earthly sphere from that serene fountain of peace and hope to which our weak philosophy cannot raise her wing for all men in itself disease is misery but chiefly for men of finer feelings and endowments to whom in return for such superiorities it seems to be sent most frequently and in its most distressing forms it is a cruel fate for the poet to have the sunny land of his imagination often the sole territory he is lord of disfigured and darkened by the shades of pain for one whose highest happiness is the exertion of his mental faculties to have them chained and paralysed in the imprisonment of a distempered frame with external activity with palpable pursuits above all with a suitable placidity of nature much even in certain states of sickness may be performed and enjoyed but for him whose heart is already overeen whose world is of the mind ideal internal when the mildew of lingering disease has struck that world and begun to blacken and consume its beauty nothing seems to remain but despondency and bitterness and desolate sorrow felt and anticipated to the end woe to him if his will likewise falter if his resolution fail and his spirit bend its neck to the yoke of this new enemy idleness and a disturbed imagination will gain the mastery of him and let loose their thousand fiends to harass him to torment him into madness alas the bondage of algiers is freedom compared with this of the sick man of genius whose heart has fainted and sunk beneath its load his clay dwelling is changed into a gloomy prison every nerve is become an avenue of disgust or anguish and the soul sits within in her melancholy loneliness a prey to the spectres of despair or stupefied with excess of suffering doomed as it were to a ife in death to a consciousness of agonised existence without the consciousness of power which should accompany it happily death or entire fatuity at length puts an end to such scenes of ignoble misery which however ignoble as they are we ought to view with pity rather than contempt such are frequently the fruits of protracted sickness in men otherwise of estimable qualities and gifts but whose sensibility exceeds their strength of mind in schiller its worst effects were resisted by the only availing antidote a strenuous determination to neglect them his spirit was too vigorous and ardent to yield even in this emergency he disdained to dwindle into a pining valetudinarian in the midst of his infirmities he persevered with unabated zeal in the great business of his life as he partially recovered he returned as strenuously as ever to his intellectual occupations and often in the glow of poetical conception he almost forgot his maladies by such resolute and manly conduct he disarmed sickness of its cruelest power to wound his frame might be in pain but his spirit retained its force unextinguished almost unimpeded he did not lose his relish for the beautiful the grand or the good in any of their shapes he loved his friends as formerly and wrote his finest and sublimest works when his health was gone perhaps no period of his life displayed more heroism than the present one after this severe attack and the kind provision which he had received from denmark schiller seems to have relaxed his connexion with the university of jena the weightiest duties of his class appear to have been discharged by proxy and his historical studies to have been forsaken yet this was but a change not an abatement in the activity of his mind once partially free from pain all his former diligence awoke and being also free from the more pressing calls of duty and economy he was now allowed to turn his attention to objects which attracted it more among these one of the most alluring was the philosophy of kant the transcendental system of the k nigsberg professor had for the last ten years been spreading over germany which it had now filled with the most violent contentions the powers and accomplishments of kant were universally acknowledged the high pretensions of his system pretensions it is true such as had been a thousand times put forth a thousand times found wanting still excited notice when so backed by ability and reputation the air of mysticism connected with these doctrines was attractive to the german mind with which the vague and the vast are always pleasing qualities the dreadful array of first principles the forest huge of terminology and definitions where the panting intellect of weaker men wanders as in pathless thickets and at length sinks powerless to the earth oppressed with fatigue and suffocated with scholastic miasma seemed sublime rather than appalling to the germans men who shrink not at toil and to whom a certain degree of darkness appears a native element essential for giving play to that deep meditative enthusiasm which forms so important a feature in their character kant philosophy accordingly found numerous disciples and possessed them with a zeal unexampled since the days of pythagoras this in fact resembled spiritual fanaticism rather than a calm ardour in the cause of science kant warmest admirers seemed to regard him more in the light of a prophet than of a mere earthly sage such admiration was of course opposed by corresponding censure the transcendental neophytes had to encounter sceptical gainsayers as determined as themselves of this latter class the most remarkable were herder and wieland herder then a clergyman of weimar seems never to have comprehended what he fought against so keenly he denounced and condemned the kantean metaphysics because he found them heterodox the young divines came back from the university of jena with their minds well nigh delirious full of strange doctrines which they explained to the examinators of the weimar consistorium in phrases that excited no idea in the heads of these reverend persons but much horror in their hearts hence reprimands and objurgations and excessive bitterness between the applicants for ordination and those appointed to confer it one young clergyman at weimar shot himself on this account heresy and jarring and unprofitable logic were universal hence herder vehement attacks on this ernicious quackery this delusive and destructive ystem of words wieland strove against it for another reason he had all his life been labouring to give currency among his countrymen to a species of diluted epicurism to erect a certain smooth and elegant and very slender scheme of taste and morals borrowed from our shaftesbury and the french all this feeble edifice the new doctrine was sweeping before it to utter ruin with the violence of a tornado it grieved wieland to see the work of half a century destroyed he fondly imagined that but for kant philosophy it might have been perennial with scepticism quickened into action by such motives herder and he went forth as brother champions against the transcendental metaphysics they were not long without a multitude of hot assailants the uproar produced among thinking men by the conflict has scarcely been equalled in germany since the days of luther fields were fought and victories lost and won nearly all the minds of the nation were in secret or openly arrayed on this side or on that goethe alone seemed altogether to retain his wonted composure he was clear for allowing the kantean scheme to ave its day as all things have goethe has already lived to see the wisdom of this sentiment so characteristic of his genius and turn of thought footnote schelling has a book on the oul of the world fichte expression to his students tomorrow gentlemen i shall create god is known to most readers footnote see herder leben by his widow that herder was not usually troubled with any unphilosophical scepticism or aversion to novelty may be inferred from his patronising dr gall system of phrenology or kulloctrine as they call it in germany but gall had referred with acknowledgment and admiration to the philosophie der geschichte der menschheit here lay a difference in these controversies soon pushed beyond the bounds of temperate or wholesome discussion schiller took no part but the noise they made afforded him a fresh inducement to investigate a set of doctrines so important in the general estimation a system which promised even with a very little plausibility to accomplish all that kant asserted his complete performance of to explain the difference between matter and spirit to unravel the perplexities of necessity and freeill to show us the true grounds of our belief in god and what hope nature gives us of the soul immortality and thus at length after a thousand failures to interpret the enigma of our being hardly needed that additional inducement to make such a man as schiller grasp at it with eager curiosity his progress also was facilitated by his present circumstances jena had now become the chief wellpring of kantean doctrine a distinction or disgrace it has ever since continued to deserve reinhold one of kant ablest followers was at this time schiller felloweacher and daily companion he did not fail to encourage and assist his friend in a path of study which as he believed conducted to such glorious results under this tuition schiller was not long in discovering that at least the ew philosophy was more poetical than that of leibnitz and had a grander character persuasions which of course confirmed him in his resolution to examine it how far schiller penetrated into the arcana of transcendentalism it is impossible for us to say the metaphysical and logical branches of it seem to have afforded him no solid satisfaction or taken no firm hold of his thoughts their influence is scarcely to be traced in any of his subsequent writings the only department to which he attached himself with his ordinary zeal was that which relates to the principles of the imitative arts with their moral influences and which in the kantean nomenclature has been designated by the term sthetics or the doctrine of sentiments and emotions on these subjects he had already amassed a multitude of thoughts to see which expressed by new symbols and arranged in systematic form and held together by some common theory would necessarily yield enjoyment to his intellect and inspire him with fresh alacrity in prosecuting such researches the new light which dawned or seemed to dawn upon him in the course of these investigations is reflected in various treatises evincing at least the honest diligence with which he studied and the fertility with which he could produce of these the largest and most elaborate are the essays on grace and dignity on na ve and sentimental poetry and the letters on the sthetic culture of man the other pieces are on tragic art on the pathetic on the cause of our delight in tragic objects on employing the low and common in art footnote from the verb to feel the term is baumgarten prior to kant being cast in the mould of kantism or at least clothed in its garments these productions to readers unacquainted with that system are encumbered here and there with difficulties greater than belong intrinsically to the subject in perusing them the uninitiated student is mortified at seeing so much powerful thought distorted as he thinks into such fantastic forms the principles of reasoning on which they rest are apparently not those of common logic a dimness and doubt overhangs their conclusions scarcely anything is proved in a convincing manner but this is no strange quality in such writings to an exoteric reader the philosophy of kant almost always appears to invert the common maxim its end and aim seem not to be o make abstruse things simple but to make simple things abstruse often a proposition of inscrutable and dread aspect when resolutely grappled with and torn from its shady den and its bristling entrenchments of uncouth terminology and dragged forth into the open light of day to be seen by the natural eye and tried by merely human understanding proves to be a very harmless truth familiar to us from of old sometimes so familiar as to be a truism too frequently the anxious novice is reminded of dryden in the battle of the books there is a helmet of rusty iron dark grim gigantic and within it at the farthest corner is a head no bigger than a walnut these are the general errors of kantean criticism in the present works they are by no means of the worst or most pervading kind and there is a fundamental merit which does more than counterbalance them by the aid of study the doctrine set before us can in general at length be comprehended and schiller fine intellect recognisable even in its masquerade is ever and anon peering forth in its native form which all may understand which all must relish and presenting us with passages that show like bright verdant islands in the misty sea of metaphysics we have been compelled to offer these remarks on kant philosophy but it is right to add that they are the result of only very limited acquaintance with the subject we cannot wish that any influence of ours should add a note however feeble to the loud and not at all melodious cry which has been raised against it in this country when a class of doctrines so involved in difficulties yet so sanctioned by illustrious names is set before us curiosity must have a theory respecting them and indolence and other humbler feelings are too ready to afford her one to call kant system a laborious dream and its adherents crazy mystics is a brief method brief but false the critic whose philosophy includes the craziness of men like these so easily and smoothly in its formulas should render thanks to heaven for having gifted him with science and acumen as few in any age or country have been gifted meaner men however ought to recollect that where we do not understand we should postpone deciding or at least keep our decision for our own exclusive benefit we of england may reject this kantean system perhaps with reason but it ought to be on other grounds than are yet before us philosophy is science and science as schiller has observed cannot always be explained in onversations by the parlour fire or in written treatises that resemble such the cui bono of these doctrines may not it is true be expressible by arithmetical computations the subject also is perplexed with obscurities and probably with manifold delusions and too often its interpreters with us have been like enebrific stars that id ray out darkness on a matter itself sufficiently dark but what then is the jewel always to be found among the common dust of the highway and always to be estimated by its value in the common judgment it lies embosomed in the depths of the mine rocks must be rent before it can be reached skilful eyes and hands must separate it from the rubbish where it lies concealed and kingly purchasers alone can prize it and buy it this law of ostracism is as dangerous in science as it was of old in politics let us not forget that many things are true which cannot be demonstrated by the rules of watts logic that many truths are valuable for which no price is given in paternoster row and no preferment offered at st stephen whoever reads these treatises of schiller with attention will perceive that they depend on principles of an immensely higher and more complex character than our on taste and our nquiries concerning the freedom of the will the laws of criticism which it is their purpose to establish are derived from the inmost nature of man the scheme of morality which they inculcate soars into a brighter region very far beyond the ken of our tilities and eflexenses they do not teach us o judge of poetry and art as we judge of dinner merely by observing the impressions it produced in us and they do derive the duties and chief end of man from other grounds than the philosophy of profit and loss these letters on sthetic culture without the aid of anything which the most sceptical could designate as superstition trace out and attempt to sanction for us a system of morality in which the sublimest feelings of the stoic and the christian are represented but as stages in our progress to the pinnacle of true human grandeur and man isolated on this fragment of the universe encompassed with the boundless desolate unknown at war with fate without help or the hope of help is confidently called upon to rise into a calm cloudless height of internal activity and peace and be what he has fondly named himself the god of this lower world when such are the results who would not make an effort for the steps by which they are attained in schiller treatises it must be owned the reader after all exertions will be fortunate if he can find them yet a second perusal will satisfy him better than the first and among the shapeless immensities which fill the night of kantism and the meteoric coruscations which perplex him rather than enlighten he will fancy he descries some streaks of a serener radiance which he will pray devoutly that time may purify and ripen into perfect day the philosophy of kant is probably combined with errors to its very core but perhaps also this ponderous unmanageable dross may bear in it the everlasting gold of truth mighty spirits have already laboured in refining it is it wise in us to take up with the base pewter of utility and renounce such projects altogether we trust not footnote are our hopes from mr coleridge always to be fruitless sneers at the commonense philosophy of the scotch are of little use it is a poor philosophy perhaps but not so poor as none at all which seems to be the state of matters here at present that schiller genius profited by this laborious and ardent study of sthetic metaphysics has frequently been doubted and sometimes denied that after such investigations the process of composition would become more difficult might be inferred from the nature of the case that also the principles of this critical theory were in part erroneous in still greater part too faretched and finepun for application to the business of writing we may farther venture to assert but excellence not ease of composition is the thing to be desired and in a mind like schiller so full of energy of images and thoughts and creative power the more sedulous practice of selection was little likely to be detrimental and though considerable errors might mingle with the rules by which he judged himself the habit of judging carelessly or not at all is far worse than that of sometimes judging wrong besides once accustomed to attend strictly to the operations of his genius and rigorously to try its products such a man as schiller could not fail in time to discover what was false in the principles by which he tried them and consequently in the end to retain the benefits of this procedure without its evils there is doubtless a purism in taste a rigid fantastical demand of perfection a horror at approaching the limits of impropriety which obstructs the free impulse of the faculties and if excessive would altogether deaden them but the excess on the other side is much more frequent and for high endowments infinitely more pernicious after the strongest efforts there may be little realised without strong efforts there must be little that too much care does hurt in any of our tasks is a doctrine so flattering to indolence that we ought to receive it with extreme caution in works impressed with the stamp of true genius their quality not their extent is what we value a dull man may spend his lifetime writing little better so than writing much but a man of powerful mind is liable to no such danger of all our authors gray is perhaps the only one that from fastidiousness of taste has written less than he should have done there are thousands that have erred the other way what would a spanish reader give had lope de vega composed a hundred times as little and that little a hundred times as well schiller own ideas on these points appear to be sufficiently sound they are sketched in the following extract of a letter interesting also as a record of his purposes and intellectual condition at this period riticism must now make good to me the damage she herself has done and damaged me she most certainly has for the boldness the living glow which i felt before a rule was known to me have for several years been wanting i now see myself create and form i watch the play of inspiration and my fancy knowing she is not without witnesses of her movements no longer moves with equal freedom i hope however ultimately to advance so far that art shall become a second nature as polished manners are to wellred men then imagination will regain her former freedom and submit to none but voluntary limitations schiller subsequent writings are the best proof that in these expectations he had not miscalculated the historical and critical studies in which he had been so extensively and seriously engaged could not remain without effect on schiller general intellectual character he had spent five active years in studies directed almost solely to the understanding or the faculties connected with it and such industry united to such ardour had produced an immense accession of ideas history had furnished him with pictures of manners and events of strange conjunctures and conditions of existence it had given him more minute and truer conceptions of human nature in its many forms new and more accurate opinions on the character and end of man the domain of his mind was both enlarged and enlightened a multitude of images and detached facts and perceptions had been laid up in his memory and his intellect was at once enriched by acquired thoughts and strengthened by increased exercise on a wider circle of knowledge but to understand was not enough for schiller there were in him faculties which this could not employ and therefore could not satisfy the primary vocation of his nature was poetry the acquisitions of his other faculties served but as the materials for his poetic faculty to act upon and seemed imperfect till they had been sublimated into the pure and perfect forms of beauty which it is the business of this to elicit from them new thoughts gave birth to new feelings and both of these he was now called upon to body forth to represent by visible types to animate and adorn with the magic of creative genius the first youthful blaze of poetic ardour had long since passed away but this large increase of knowledge awakened it anew refined by years and experience into a steadier and clearer flame vague shadows of unaccomplished excellence gleams of ideal beauty were now hovering fitfully across his mind he longed to turn them into shape and give them a local habitation and a name criticism likewise had exalted his notions of art the modern writers on subjects of taste aristotle the ancient poets he had lately studied he had carefully endeavoured to extract the truth from each and to amalgamate their principles with his own in choosing he was now more difficult to satisfy minor poems had all along been partly occupying his attention but they yielded no space for the intensity of his impulses and the magnificent ideas that were rising in his fancy conscious of his strength he dreaded not engaging with the highest species of his art the perusal of the greek tragedians had given rise to some late translations the perusal of homer seems now to have suggested the idea of an epic poem the hero whom he first contemplated was gustavus adolphus he afterwards changed to frederick the great of prussia footnote these were a fine version of euripides iphigenia in aulide and a few scenes of his ph niss epic poems since the time of the epigoniad and leonidas and especially since that of some more recent attempts have with us become a mighty dull affair that schiller aimed at something infinitely higher than these faint and superannuated imitations far higher than even klopstock has attained will appear by the following extract from one of his letters n epic poem in the eighteenth century should be quite a different thing from such a poem in the childhood of the world and it is that very circumstance which attracts me so much towards this project our manners the finest essence of our philosophies our politics economy arts in short of all we know and do would require to be introduced without constraint and interwoven in such a composition to live there in beautiful harmonious freedom as all the branches of greek culture live and are made visible in homer iliad nor am i disinclined to invent a species of machinery for this purpose being anxious to fulfil with hairsbreadth accuracy all the requisitions that are made of epic poets even on the side of form besides this machinery which in a subject so modern in an age so prosaic appears to present the greatest difficulty might exalt the interest in a high degree were it suitably adapted to this same modern spirit crowds of confused ideas on this matter are rolling to and fro within my head something distinct will come out of them at last s for the sort of metre i would choose this i think you will hardly guess no other than ottave rime all the rest except iambic are become insufferable to me and how beautifully might the earnest and the lofty be made to play in these light fetters what attractions might the epic substance gain by the soft yielding form of this fine rhyme for the poem must not in name only but in very deed be capable of being sung as the iliad was sung by the peasants of greece as the stanzas of jerusalem delivered are still sung by the venetian gondoliers he epoch of frederick life that would fit me best i have considered also i should wish to select some unhappy situation it would allow me to unfold his mind far more poetically the chief action should if possible be very simple perplexed with no complicated circumstances that the whole might easily be comprehended at a glance though the episodes were never so numerous in this respect there is no better model than the iliad schiller did not execute or even commence the project he has here so philosophically sketched the constraints of his present situation the greatness of the enterprise compared with the uncertainty of its success were sufficient to deter him besides he felt that after all his wide excursions the true home of his genius was the drama the department where its powers had first been tried and were now by habit or nature best qualified to act to the drama he accordingly returned the history of the thirtyears war had once suggested the idea of gustavus adolphus as the hero of an epic poem the same work afforded him a subject for a tragedy he now decided on beginning wallenstein in this undertaking it was no easy task that he contemplated a common play did not now comprise his aim he required some magnificent and comprehensive object in which he could expend to advantage the new poetical and intellectual treasures which he had for years been amassing something that should at once exemplify his enlarged ideas of art and give room and shape to his fresh stores of knowledge and sentiment as he studied the history of wallenstein and viewed its capabilities on every side new ideas gathered round it the subject grew in magnitude and often changed in form his progress in actual composition was of course irregular and small yet the difficulties of the subject increasing with his own wider more ambitious conceptions did not abate his diligence wallenstein with many interruptions and many alterations sometimes stationary sometimes retrograde continued on the whole though slowly to advance this was for several years his chosen occupation the task to which he consecrated his brightest hours and the finest part of his faculties for humbler employments demanding rather industry than inspiration there still remained abundant leisure of which it was inconsistent with his habits to waste a single hour his occasional labours accordingly were numerous varied and sometimes of considerable extent in the end of a new object seemed to call for his attention he once about this time seriously meditated mingling in politics the french revolution had from the first affected him with no ordinary hopes which however the course of events particularly the imprisonment of louis were now fast converting into fears for the illated monarch and the cause of freedom which seemed threatened with disgrace in the treatment he was likely to receive schiller felt so deeply interested that he had determined in his case a determination not without its risks to address an appeal on these subjects to the french people and the world at large the voice of reason advocating liberty as well as order might still he conceived make a salutary impression in this period of terror and delusion the voice of a distinguished man would at first sound like the voice of the nation which he seemed to represent schiller was inquiring for a proper french translator and revolving in his mind the various arguments that might be used and the comparative propriety of using or forbearing to use them but the progress of things superseded the necessity of such deliberation in a few months louis perished on the scaffold the bourbon family were murdered or scattered over europe and the french government was changed into a frightful chaos amid the tumultuous and bloody horrors of which calm truth had no longer a chance to be heard schiller turned away from these repulsive and appalling scenes into other regions where his heart was more familiar and his powers more likely to produce effect the french revolution had distressed and shocked him but it did not lessen his attachment to liberty the name of which had been so desecrated in its wild convulsions perhaps in his subsequent writings we can trace a more respectful feeling towards old establishments more reverence for the majesty of custom and with an equal zeal a weaker faith in human perfectibility changes indeed which are the common fruit of years themselves in whatever age or climate of the world our experience may be gathered among the number of fluctuating engagements one which for ten years had been constant with him was the editing of the thalia the principles and performances of that work he had long looked upon as insufficient in particular ever since his settlement at jena it had been among his favourite projects to exchange it for some other conducted on a more liberal scheme uniting more ability in its support and embracing a much wider compass of literary interests many of the most distinguished persons in germany had agreed to assist him in executing such a plan goethe himself a host undertook to go hand in hand with him the thalia was in consequence relinquished at the end of and the first number of the horen came out early in the following year this publication was enriched with many valuable pieces on points of philosophy and criticism some of schiller finest essays first appeared here even without the foreign aids which had been promised him it already bade fair to outdo as he had meant it should every previous work of that description the musenlmanach of which he likewise undertook the superintendence did not aim so high like other works of the same title which are numerous in germany it was intended for preserving and annually delivering to the world a series of short poetical effusions or other fugitive compositions collected from various quarters and often having no connexion but their juxtaposition in this work as well as in the horen some of schiller finest smaller poems made their first appearance many of these pieces being written about this period especially the greater part of his ballads the idea of attempting which took its rise in a friendly rivalry with goethe but the most noted composition sent forth in the pages of the musenlmanach was the xenien a collection of epigrams which originated partly as it seems in the mean or irritating conduct of various contemporary authors in spite of the most flattering promises and of its own intrinsic character the horen at its first appearance instead of being hailed with welcome by the leading minds of the country for whom it was intended as a rallying point met in many quarters with no sentiment but coldness or hostility the controversies of the day had sown discord among literary men schiller and goethe associating together had provoked illill from a host of persons who felt the justice of such mutual preference but liked not the inferences to be drawn from it and eyed this intellectual duumvirate however meek in the discharge of its functions and the wearing of its honours with jealousy and discontent footnote so called from munus hospitale a title borrowed from martial who has thus designated a series of personal epigrams in his thirteenth book the cavilling of these people awkwardly contrasted with their personal absurdity and insipidity at length provoked the serious notice of the two illustrious associates the result was this german dunciad a production of which the plan was that it should comprise an immense multitude of detached couplets each conveying a complete thought within itself and furnished by one of the joint operators the subjects were of unlimited variety he most as schiller says ere wild satire glancing at writers and writings intermixed with here and there a flash of poetical or philosophic thought it was at first intended to provide about a thousand of these pointed monodistichs unity in such a work appearing to consist in a certain boundlessness of size which should hide the heterogeneous nature of the individual parts the whole were then to be arranged and elaborated till they had acquired the proper degree of consistency and symmetry each sacrificing something of its own peculiar spirit to preserve the spirit of the rest this number never was completed and goethe being now busy with his wilhelm meister the project of completing it was at length renounced and the xenien were published as unconnected particles not pretending to constitute a whole enough appeared to create unbounded commotion among the parties implicated the xenien were exclaimed against abused and replied to on all hands but as they declared war not on persons but on actions not against gleim nicolai manso but against bad taste dulness and affectation nothing criminal could be sufficiently made out against them the musenlmanach where they appeared in continued to be published till the time of schiller leaving jena the horen ceased some months before footnote this is but a lame account of the faramed xenien and their results see more of the matter in franz horn poesie und beredtsamkeit in carlyle miscellanies i note of the co peration of goethe which schiller had obtained so readily in these pursuits was of singular use to him in many others both possessing minds of the first order yet constructed and trained in the most opposite modes each had much that was valuable to learn of the other and suggest to him cultivating different kinds of excellence they could joyfully admit each other merit connected by mutual services and now by community of literary interests few unkindly feelings could have place between them for a man of high equalities it is rare to find a meet companion painful and injurious to want one solitude exasperates or deadens the heart perverts or enervates the faculties association with inferiors leads to dogmatism in thought and selfill even in affections rousseau never should have lived in the val de montmorenci it had been good for warburton that hurd had not existed for johnson never to have known boswell or davies from such evils schiller and goethe were delivered their intimacy seems to have been equal frank and cordial from the contrasts and the endowments of their minds it must have had peculiar charms in his critical theories schiller had derived much profit from communicating with an intellect as excursive as his own but far cooler and more sceptical as he lopped off from his creed the excrescences of kantism goethe and he on comparing their ideas often found in them a striking similarity more striking and more gratifying when it was considered from what diverse premises these harmonious conclusions had been drawn on such subjects they often corresponded when absent and conversed when together they were in the habit of paying long visits to each other houses frequently they used to travel in company between jena and weimar t triesnitz a couple of english miles from jena goethe and he we are told ight sometimes be observed sitting at table beneath the shade of a spreading tree talking and looking at the current of passengers there are some who would have ravelled fifty miles on foot to join the party besides this intercourse with goethe he was happy in a kindly connexion with many other estimable men both in literary and in active life dalberg at a distance was to the last his friend and warmest admirer at jena he had sch tz paul hufland reinhold wilhelm von humboldt also brother of the celebrated traveller had come thither about this time and was now among his closest associates at weimar excluding less important persons there were still herder and wieland to divide his attention with goethe and what to his affectionate heart must have been the most grateful circumstance of all his aged parents were yet living to participate in the splendid fortune of the son whom they had once lamented and despaired of but never ceased to love in he paid them a visit in swabia and passed nine cheerful months among the scenes dearest to his recollection enjoying the kindness of those unalterable friends whom nature had given him and the admiring deference of those by whom it was most delightful to be honoured those who had known him in adverse and humbler circumstances whether they might have respected or contemned him by the grand duke his ancient censor and patron he was not interfered with that prince in answer to a previous application on the subject having indirectly engaged to take no notice of this journey the grand duke had already interfered too much with him and bitterly repented of his interference next year he died an event which schiller who had long forgotten past illreatment did not learn without true sorrow and grateful recollections of bygone kindness the new sovereign anxious to repair the injustice of his predecessor almost instantly made offer of a vacant t bingen professorship to schiller a proposal flattering to the latter but which by the persuasion of the duke of weimar he respectfully declined amid labours and amusements so multiplied amid such variety of intellectual exertion and of intercourse with men schiller it was clear had not suffered the encroachments of bodily disease to undermine the vigour of his mental or moral powers no period of his life displayed in stronger colours the lofty and determined zeal of his character he had already written much his fame stood upon a firm basis domestic wants no longer called upon him for incessant effort and his frame was pining under the slow canker of an incurable malady yet he never loitered never rested his fervid spirit which had vanquished opposition and oppression in his youth which had struggled against harassing uncertainties and passed unsullied through many temptations in his earlier manhood did not now yield to this last and most fatal enemy the present was the busiest most productive season of his literary life and with all its drawbacks it was probably the happiest violent attacks from his disorder were of rare occurrence and its constant influence the dark vapours with which it would have overshadowed the faculties of his head and heart were repelled by diligence and a courageous exertion of his will in other points he had little to complain of and much to rejoice in he was happy in his family the chosen scene of his sweetest most lasting satisfaction by the world he was honoured and admired his wants were provided for he had tasks which inspired and occupied him friends who loved him and whom he loved schiller had much to enjoy and most of it he owed to himself in his mode of life at jena simplicity and uniformity were the most conspicuous qualities the single excess which he admitted being that of zeal in the pursuits of literature the sin which all his life had most easily beset him his health had suffered much and principally it was thought from the practice of composing by night yet the charms of this practice were still too great for his selfenial and except in severe fits of sickness he could not discontinue it the highest proudest pleasure of his mind was that glow of intellectual production that ine frenzy which makes the poet while it lasts a new and nobler creature exalting him into brighter regions adorned by visions of magnificence and beauty and delighting all his faculties by the intense consciousness of their exerted power to enjoy this pleasure in perfection the solitary stillness of night diffusing its solemn influence over thought as well as earth and air had at length in schiller case grown indispensable for this purpose accordingly he was accustomed in the present as in former periods to invert the common order of things by day he read refreshed himself with the aspect of nature conversed or corresponded with his friends but he wrote and studied in the night and as his bodily feelings were too often those of languor and exhaustion he adopted in impatience of such mean impediments the pernicious expedient of stimulants which yield a momentary strength only to waste our remaining fund of it more speedily and surely uring summer his place of study was in a garden which at length he purchased in the suburbs of jena not far from the weselh fts house where at that time was the office of the allgemeine litteratureitung reckoning from the marketlace of jena it lies on the southest border of the town between the engelgatter and the neuthor in a hollow defile through which a part of the leutrabach flows round the city on the top of the acclivity from which there is a beautiful prospect into the valley of the saal and the fir mountains of the neighbouring forest schiller built himself a small house with a single chamber it was his favourite abode during hours of composition a great part of the works he then wrote were written here in winter he likewise dwelt apart from the noise of men in the griesbachs house on the outside of the cityrench on sitting down to his desk at night he was wont to keep some strong coffee or winehocolate but more frequently a flask of old rhenish or champagne standing by him that he might from time to time repair the exhaustion of nature often the neighbours used to hear him earnestly declaiming in the silence of the night and whoever had an opportunity of watching him on such occasions a thing very easy to be done from the heights lying opposite his little gardenouse on the other side of the dell might see him now speaking aloud and walking swiftly to and fro in his chamber then suddenly throwing himself down into his chair and writing and drinking the while sometimes more than once from the glass standing near him in winter he was to be found at his desk till four or even five olock in the morning in summer till towards three he then went to bed from which he seldom rose till nine or ten footnote he street leading from schiller dwellingouse to this was by some wags named the xenienasse a name not yet entirely disused footnote doering had prudence been the dominant quality in schiller character this practice would undoubtedly have been abandoned or rather never taken up it was an error so to waste his strength but one of those which increase rather than diminish our respect originating as it did in generous ardour for what was best and grandest they must be cold censurers that can condemn it harshly for ourselves we but lament and honour this excess of zeal its effects were mournful but its origin was noble who can picture schiller feelings in this solitude without participating in some faint reflection of their grandeur the toilorn but devoted soul alone under the silent starry canopy of night offering up the troubled moments of existence on the altar of eternity for here the splendour that gleamed across the spirit of a mortal transient as one of us was made to be perpetual these images and thoughts were to pass into other ages and distant lands to glow in human hearts when the heart that conceived them had long been mouldered into common dust to the lovers of genius this little gardenouse might have been a place to visit as a chosen shrine nor will they learn without regret that the walls of it yielding to the hand of time have already crumbled into ruin and are now no longer to be traced the piece of ground that it stood on is itself hallowed with a glory that is bright pure and abiding but the literary pilgrim could not have surveyed without peculiar emotion the simple chamber in which schiller wrote the reich der schatten the spaziergang the ideal and the immortal scenes of wallenstein the lastamed work had cost him many an anxious given him many a pleasant hour for seven years it had continued in a state of irregular and oftuspended progress sometimes ying endless and formless before him sometimes on the point of being given up altogether the multitude of ideas which he wished to incorporate in the structure of the piece retarded him and the difficulty of contenting his taste respecting the manner of effecting this retarded him still more in wallenstein he wished to embody the more enlarged notions which experience had given him of men especially which history had given him of generals and statesmen and while putting such characters in action to represent whatever was or could be made poetical in the stormy period of the thirtyears war as he meditated on the subject it continued to expand in his fancy it assumed successively a thousand forms and after all due strictness of selection such was still the extent of materials remaining on his hands that he found it necessary to divide the play into three parts distinct in their arrangements but in truth forming a continuous drama of eleven acts in this shape it was sent forth to the world in a work of labour and persevering anxiety but of anxiety and labour as it then appeared which had not been bestowed in vain wallenstein is by far the best performance he had yet produced it merits a long chapter of criticism by itself and a few hurried pages are all that we can spend on it as a porch to the great edifice stands part first entitled wallenstein camp a piece in one act it paints with much humour and graphical felicity the manners of that rude tumultuous host which wallenstein presided over and had made the engine of his ambitious schemes schiller early experience of a military life seems now to have stood him in good stead his soldiers are delineated with the distinctness of actual observation in rugged sharpness of feature they sometimes remind us of smollett seamen here are all the wild lawless spirits of europe assembled within the circuit of a single trench violent tempestuous unstable is the life they lead ishmaelites their hands against every man and every man hand against them the instruments of rapine tarnished with almost every vice and knowing scarcely any virtue but those of reckless bravery and uncalculating obedience to their leader their situation still presents some aspects which affect or amuse us and these the poet has seized with his accustomed skill much of the cruelty and repulsive harshness of these soldiers we are taught to forget in contemplating their forlorn houseless wanderings and the practical magnanimity with which even they contrive to wring from fortune a tolerable scantling of enjoyment their manner of existence wallenstein has at an after period of the action rather movingly expressed ur life was but a battle and a march and like the wind blast neveresting homeless we storm across the waronvulsed earth still farther to soften the asperities of the scene the dialogue is cast into a rude hudibrastic metre full of forced rhymes and strange doublendings with a rhythm ever changing ever rough and lively which might almost be compared to the hard irregular fluctuating sound of the regimental drum in this ludicrous doggrel with phrases and figures of a correspondent cast homely ridiculous graphic these men of service paint their hopes and doings there are ranks and kinds among them representatives of all the constituent parts of the motley multitude which followed this prince of condottieri the solemn pedantry of the ancient wachtmeister is faithfully given no less so are the jocund ferocity and heedless daring of holky j gers or the iron courage and stern camphilosophy of pappenheim cuirassiers of the j ger the sole principle is military obedience he does not reflect or calculate his business is to do whatever he is ordered and to enjoy whatever he can reach ree wished i to live he says ree wished i to live and easy and gay and see something new on each new day in the joys of the moment lustily sharing out the past or the future not thinking or caring to the kaiser therefore i sold my bacon and by him good charge of the whole is taken order me on id the whistling fiery shot over the rhinetream rapid and roaring wide a third of the troop must go to pot without loss of time i mount and ride but farther i beg very much do you see that in all things else you would leave me free the pappenheimer is an older man more sedate and more indomitable he has wandered over europe and gathered settled maxims of soldierly principle and soldierly privilege he is not without a rationale of life the various professions of men have passed in review before him but no coat that he has seen has pleased him like his own teel doublet cased in which it is his wish down on the world poor restless scramble careless through it astride of his nag to ramble yet at times with this military stoicism there is blended a dash of homely pathos he admits his sword of ours is no plough or spade you cannot delve or reap with the iron blade for us there falls no seed no cornield grows neither home nor kindred the soldier knows wandering over the face of the earth warming his hands at another hearth from the pomp of towns he must onward roam in the villagereen with its cheerful game in the mirth of the vintage or harvestome no part or lot can the soldier claim tell me then in the place of goods or pelf what has he unless to honour himself leave not even this his own what wonder the man should burn and kill and plunder but the camp of wallenstein is fall of bustle as well as speculation there are gamblers peasants sutlers soldiers recruits capuchin friars moving to and fro in restless pursuit of their several purposes the sermon of the capuchin is an unparalleled composition a medley of texts puns nicknames and verbal logic conglutinated by a stupid judgment and a fiery catholic zeal it seems to be delivered with great unction and to find fit audience in the camp towards the conclusion they rush upon him and he narrowly escapes killing or ducking for having ventured to glance a censure at the general the soldiers themselves are jeering wrangling jostling discussing their wishes and expectations and at last they combine in a profound deliberation on the state of their affairs a vague exaggerated outline of the coming events and personages is imaged to us in their coarse conceptions we dimly discover the precarious position of wallenstein the plots which threaten him which he is meditating we trace the leading qualities of the principal officers and form a high estimate of the potent spirit which binds this fierce discordant mass together and seems to be the object of universal reverence where nothing else is revered footnote said to be by goethe the materials faithfully extracted from a real sermon by the jesuit santa clar of the period it refers to there were various jesuits santa clara of that period this is the german one abraham by name specimens of whose sermons a fervent kind of preachingunad have been reprinted in late years for dilettante purposes note of in the two piccolomini the next division of the work the generals for whom we have thus been prepared appear in person on the scene and spread out before us their plots and counterplots wallenstein through personal ambition and evil counsel slowly resolving to revolt and octavio piccolomini in secret undermining his influence among the leaders and preparing for him that pit of ruin into which in the third part wallenstein death we see him sink with all his fortunes the military spirit which pervades the former piece is here well sustained the ruling motives of these captains and colonels are a little more refined or more disguised than those of the cuirassiers and j gers but they are the same in substance the love of present or future pleasure of action reputation money power selfishness but selfishness distinguished by a superficial external propriety and gilded over with the splendour of military honour of courage inflexible yet light cool and unassuming these are not imaginary heroes but genuine hired men of war we do not love them yet there is a pomp about their operations which agreeably fills up the scene this din of war this clash of tumultuous conflicting interests is felt as a suitable accompaniment to the affecting or commanding movements of the chief characters whom it envelops or obeys of the individuals that figure in this world of war wallenstein himself the strong atlas which supports it all is by far the most imposing wallenstein is the model of a highouled great accomplished man whose ruling passion is ambition he is daring to the utmost pitch of manhood he is enthusiastic and vehement but the fire of his soul burns hid beneath a deep stratum of prudence guiding itself by calculations which extend to the extreme limits of his most minute concerns this prudence sometimes almost bordering on irresolution forms the outward rind of his character and for a while is the only quality which we discover in it the immense influence which his genius appears to exert on every individual of his many followers prepares us to expect a great man and when wallenstein after long delay and much forewarning is in fine presented to us we at first experience something like a disappointment we find him indeed possessed of a staid grandeur yet involved in mystery wavering between two opinions and as it seems with all his wisdom blindly credulous in matters of the highest import it is only when events have forced decision on him that he rises in his native might that his giant spirit stands unfolded in its strength before us ight must it be ere friedland star will beam amid difficulties darkness and impending ruin at which the boldest of his followers grow pale he himself is calm and first in this awful crisis feels the serenity and conscious strength of his soul return wallenstein in fact though preeminent in power both external and internal of high intellect and commanding will skilled in war and statesmanship beyond the best in europe the idol of sixty thousand fearless hearts is not yet removed above our sympathy we are united with him by feelings which he reckons weak though they belong to the most generous parts of his nature his indecision partly takes its rise in the sensibilities of his heart as well as in the caution of his judgment his belief in astrology which gives force and confirmation to this tendency originates in some soft kindly emotions and adds a new interest to the spirit of the warrior it humbles him to whom the earth is subject before those mysterious powers which weigh the destinies of man in their balance in whose eyes the greatest and the least of mortals scarcely differ in littleness wallenstein confidence in the friendship of octavio his disinterested love for max piccolomini his paternal and brotherly kindness are feelings which cast an affecting lustre over the harsher more heroic qualities wherewith they are combined his treason to the emperor is a crime for which provoked and tempted as he was we do not greatly blame him it is forgotten in our admiration of his nobleness or recollected only as a venial trespass schiller has succeeded well with wallenstein where it was not easy to succeed the truth of history has been but little violated yet we are compelled to feel that wallenstein whose actions individually are trifling unsuccessful and unlawful is a strong sublime commanding character we look at him with interest our concern at his fate is tinged with a shade of kindly pity in octavio piccolomini his warompanion we can find less fault yet we take less pleasure octavio qualities are chiefly negative he rather walks by the letter of the moral law than by its spirit his conduct is externally correct but there is no touch of generosity within he is more of the courtier than of the soldier his weapon is intrigue not force believing firmly that hatever is is best he distrusts all new and extraordinary things he has no faith in human nature and seems to be virtuous himself more by calculation than by impulse we scarcely thank him for his loyalty serving his emperor he ruins and betrays his friend and besides though he does not own it personal ambition is among his leading motives he wishes to be general and prince and wallenstein is not only a traitor to his sovereign but a bar to this advancement it is true octavio does not personally tempt him towards his destruction but neither does he warn him from it and perhaps he knew that fresh temptation was superfluous wallenstein did not deserve such treatment from a man whom he had trusted as a brother even though such confidence was blind and guided by visions and starry omens octavio is a skilful prudent managing statesman of the kind praised loudly if not sincerely by their friends and detested deeply by their enemies his object may be lawful or even laudable but his ways are crooked we dislike him but the more that we know not positively how to blame him octavio piccolomini and wallenstein are as it were the two opposing forces by which this whole universe of military politics is kept in motion the struggle of magnanimity and strength combined with treason against cunning and apparent virtue aided by law gives rise to a series of great actions which are here vividly presented to our view we mingle in the clashing interests of these men of war we see them at their gorgeous festivals and stormy consultations and participate in the hopes or fears that agitate them the subject had many capabilities and schiller has turned them all to profit our minds are kept alert by a constant succession of animating scenes of spectacle dialogue incident the plot thickens and darkens as we advance the interest deepens and deepens to the very end but among the tumults of this busy multitude there are two forms of celestial beauty that solicit our attention and whose destiny involved with that of those around them gives it an importance in our eyes which it could not otherwise have had max piccolomini octavio son and thekla the daughter of wallenstein diffuse an ethereal radiance over all this tragedy they call forth the finest feelings of the heart where other feelings had already been aroused they superadd to the stirring pomp of scenes which had already kindled our imaginations the enthusiasm of bright unworn humanity he bloom of young desire the purple light of love the history of max and thekla is not a rare one in poetry but schiller has treated it with a skill which is extremely rare both of them are represented as combining every excellence their affection is instantaneous and unbounded yet the coolest most sceptical reader is forced to admire them and believe in them of max we are taught from the first to form the highest expectations the common soldiers and their captains speak of him as of a perfect hero the cuirassiers had at pappenheim death on the field of tzen appointed him their colonel by unanimous election his appearance answers these ideas max is the very spirit of honour and integrity and young ardour personified though but passing into maturer age he has already seen and suffered much but the experience of the man has not yet deadened or dulled the enthusiasm of the boy he has lived since his very childhood constantly amid the clang of war and with few ideas but those of camps yet here by a native instinct his heart has attracted to it all that was noble and graceful in the trade of arms rejecting all that was repulsive or ferocious he loves wallenstein his patron his gallant and majestic leader he loves his present way of life because it is one of peril and excitement because he knows no other but chiefly because his young unsullied spirit can shed a resplendent beauty over even the wastest region in the destiny of man yet though a soldier and the bravest of soldiers he is not this alone he feels that there are fairer scenes in life which these scenes of havoc and distress but deform or destroy his first acquaintance with the princess thekla unveils to him another world which till then he had not dreamed of a land of peace and serene elysian felicity the charms of which he paints with simple and unrivalled eloquence max is not more daring than affectionate he is merciful and gentle though his training has been under tents modest and altogether unpretending though young and universally admired we conceive his aspect to be thoughtful but fervid dauntless but mild he is the very poetry of war the essence of a youthful hero we should have loved him anywhere but here amid barren scenes of strife and danger he is doubly dear to us his first appearance wins our favour his eloquence in sentiment prepares us to expect no common magnanimity in action it is as follows octavio and questenberg are consulting on affairs of state max enters he is just returned from convoying the princess thekla and her mother the daughter and the wife of friedland to the camp at pilsen act i scene max piccolomini octavio piccolomini questenberg max is he himself my father welcome welcome he embraces him on turning round he observes questenberg and draws coldly back busied i perceive i will not interrupt you oct how now max view this stranger better an old friend deserves regard and kindness the kaiser messenger should be rever max drily von questenberg if it is good that brings you to our headuarters welcome quest has taken his hand nay draw not your hand away count piccolomini not on mine own account alone i grasp it and nothing common will i say therewith octavio max piccolomini taking both their hands names of benignant solemn import never can austria fortune fail while two such stars to guide and guard her gleam above our hosts max you play it wrong sir minister to praise i wot you come not hither to blame and censure you are come let me be no exception oct to max he comes from court where every one is not so well contented with the duke as here max and what new fault have they to charge him with that he alone decides what he alone can understand well should it not be so it should and must this man was never made to ply and mould himself like wax to others it goes against his heart he cannot do it he has the spirit of a ruler and the station of a ruler well for us it is so few can rule themselves can use their wisdom wisely happy for the whole where there is one among them that can be a centre and a hold for many thousands that can plant himself like a firm column for the whole to lean on safely such a one is wallenstein some other man might better serve the court none else could serve the army quest the army truly max and it is a pleasure to behold how all awakes and strengthens and revives around him how men faculties come forth their gifts grow plainer to themselves from each he can elicit his endowment his peculiar power and does it wisely leaving each to be the man he found him watching only that he always be so i th proper place and thus he makes the talents of all mankind his own quest no one denies him skill in men and skill to use them his fault is that in the ruler he forgets the servant as if he had been born to be commander max and is he not by birth he is invested with all gifts for it and with the farther gift of finding scope to use them of acquiring for the ruler faculties the ruler office quest so that how far the rest of us have rights or influence if any lies with friedland max he is no common person he requires no common confidence allow him space the proper limit he himself will set quest the trial shows it max ay thus it is with them still so all frights them that has any depth nowhere are they at ease but in the shallows oct to quest let him have his way my friend the argument will not avail us max they invoke the spirit i th hour of need and shudder when he rises the great the wonderful must be accomplished like a thing of course in war in battle a moment is decisive on the spot must be determin in the instant done with evy noble quality of nature the leader must be gifted let him live then in their noble sphere the oracle within him the living spirit not dead books old forms not moulding parchments must he take to counsel oct my son despise not these old narrow forms they are as barriers precious walls and fences which oppressed mortals have erected to modate the rash will of their oppressors for the uncontrolled has ever been destructive the way of order though it lead through windings is the best right forward goes the lightning and the cannonall quick by the nearest path they come oping with murderous crash their way to blast and ruin my son the quiet road which men frequent where peace and blessings travel follows the river course the valley bendings modest skirts the cornfield and the vineyard revering property appointed bounds and leading safe though slower to the mark quest o hear your father him who is at once a hero and a man oct it is the child o th camp that speaks in thee my son a war of fifteen years has nursed and taught thee peace thou hast never seen my son there is a worth beyond the worth of warriors ev in war itself the object is not war the rapid deeds of power th astounding wonders of the moment it is not these that minister to man aught useful aught benignant or enduring in haste the wandering soldier comes and builds with canvas his light town here in a moment is a rushing concourse markets open roads and rivers crowd with merchandise and people traffic stirs his hundred arms ere long some morning look and it is gone the tents are struck the host has marched away dead as a churchyard lies the trampled seedield and wasted is the harvest of the year max o father that the kaiser would make peace the bloody laurel i would gladly change for the first violet spring should offer us the tiny pledge that earth again was young oct how this what is it that affects thee so max peace i have never seen yes i have seen it ev now i come from it my journey led me through lands as yet unvisited by war o father life has charms of which we know not we have but seen the barren coasts of life like some wild roving crew of lawless pirates who crowded in their narrow noisome ship upon the rude sea with rude manners dwell naught of the fair land knowing but the bays where they may risk their hurried thievish landing of the loveliness that in its peaceful dales the land conceals o father o of this in our wild voyage we have seen no glimpse oct gives increased attention and did this journey show thee much of it max was the first holiday of my existence tell me where the end of all this labour this grinding labour that has stolen my youth and left my heart uncheer and void my spirit uncultivated as a wilderness this camp unceasing din the neighing steeds the trumpet clang the neverhanging round of service discipline parade give nothing to the heart the heart that longs for nourishment there is no soul in this insipid busess life has another fate and other joys oct much hast thou learn my son in this short journey max o blessed bright day when at last the soldier shall turn back to life and be again a man through th merry lines the colours are unfurl and homeward beats the thrilling soft peacearch all hats and helmets deck with leafy sprays the last spoil of the fields the city gates fly up now needs not the petard to burst them the walls are crowded with rejoicing people their shouts ring through the air from every tower blithe bells are pealing forth the merry vesper of that bloody day from town and hamlet flow the jocund thousands with their hearty kind impetuosity our march impeding the old man weeping that he sees this day embraces his longost son a stranger he revisits his old home with spreading boughs the tree orshadows him at his return which waver as a twig when he departed and modest blushing comes a maid to meet him whom on her nurse breast he left o happy for whom some kindly door like this for whom soft arms to clasp him shall be open quest with emotion o that the times you speak of should be so far distant should not be tomorrow be today max and who to blame for it but you at court i will deal plainly with you questenberg when i observ you here a twinge of spleen and bitterness went through me it is you that hinder peace yes you the general must force it and you ever keep tormenting him obstructing all his steps abusing him for what because the good of europe lies nearer his heart than whether certain acres more or less of dirty land be austria you call him traitor rebel god knows what because he spares the saxons as if that were not the only way to peace for how if during war war end not can peace follow go to go to as i love goodness so i hate this paltry work of yours and here i vow to god for him this rebel traitor wallenstein to shed my blood my heart blood drop by drop ere i will see you triumph in his fall the princess thekla is perhaps still dearer to us thekla just entering on life with imid steps with the brilliant visions of a cloister yet undisturbed by the contradictions of reality beholds in max not merely her protector and escort to her father camp but the living emblem of her shapeless yet glowing dreams she knows not deception she trusts and is trusted their spirits meet and mingle and lasp each other firmly and forever all this is described by the poet with a quiet inspiration which finds its way into our deepest sympathies such beautiful simplicity is irresistible ow long the countess terzky asks how long is it since you disclosed your heart max this morning first i risked a word of it coun not till this morning during twenty days max was at the castle where you met us wixt this and nepomuk the last stage of the journey on a balcony she and i were standing our looks in silence turn upon the vacant landscape and before us the dragoons were riding whom the duke had sent to be her escort heavy on my heart lay thoughts of parting and with a faltering voice at last i said all this reminds me fr ulein that today i must be parted from my happiness in few hours you will find a father will see yourself encircled by new friends and i shall be to you nought but a stranger forgotten in the crowd speak with aunt terzky quick she interrupted me i noticed a quiving in her voice a glowing blush spread or her cheeks slow rising from the ground her eyes met mine i could control myself no longer the princess appears at the door and stops the countess but not piccolomini observing her i clasp her wildly in my arms my lips were join with hers some footsteps stirring i th next room parted us was you what then took place you know coun and can you be so modest or incurious as not once to ask me for my secret in return max your secret coun yes sure on coming in the moment after how my niece receiv me what i th instant of her first surprise she max ha thekla enters hastily spare yourself the trouble aunt that he can learn from me we rejoice in the ardent pure and confiding affection of these two angelic beings but our feeling is changed and made more poignant when we think that the inexorable hand of destiny is already lifted to smite their world with blackness and desolation thekla has enjoyed wo little hours of heavenly beauty but her native gaiety gives place to serious anticipations and alarms she feels that the camp of wallenstein is not a place for hope to dwell in the instructions and explanations of her aunt disclose the secret she is not to love max a higher it may be a royal fate awaits her but she is to tempt him from his duty and make him lend his influence to her father whose daring projects she now for the first time discovers from that moment her hopes of happiness have vanished never more to return yet her own sorrows touch her less than the ruin which she sees about to overwhelm her tender and affectionate mother for herself she waits with gloomy patience the stroke that is to crush her she is meek and soft and maidenike but she is friedland daughter and does not shrink from what is unavoidable there is often a rectitude and quick inflexibility of resolution about thekla which contrasts beautifully with her inexperience and timorous acuteness of feeling on discovering her father treason she herself decides that max hall obey his first impulse and forsake her there are few scenes in poetry more sublimely pathetic than this we behold the sinking but still fiery glory of wallenstein opposed to the impetuous despair of max piccolomini torn asunder by the claims of duty and of love the calm but brokenearted thekla beside her brokenearted mother and surrounded by the blank faces of wallenstein desponding followers there is a physical pomp corresponding to the moral grandeur of the action the successive revolt and departure of the troops is heard without the walls of the palace the trumpets of the pappenheimers re cho the wild feelings of their leader what follows too is equally affecting max being forced away by his soldiers from the side of thekla rides forth at their head in a state bordering on frenzy next day come tidings of his fate which no heart is hard enough to hear unmoved the effect it produces upon thekla displays all the hidden energies of her soul the first accidental hearing of the news had almost overwhelmed her but she summons up her strength she sends for the messenger that she may question him more closely and listen to his stern details with the heroism of a spartan virgin act scene thekla the swedish captain fr ulein neubrunn capt

no surprise we lay slightly entrench when towards night a cloud of dust rose from the forest and our outposts rush into the camp and cried the foe was there scarce had we time to spring on horseback when the pappenheimers coming at full gallop dash or the palisado and next moment these fierce troopers pass our camprench also but thoughtlessly their courage had impelled them to advance without support their infantry was far behind only the pappenheimers boldly following their bold leader thekla makes a movement the captain pauses for a moment till she beckons him to proceed on front and flank with all our horse we charged them and ere long forc them back upon the trench where rank in haste our infantry presented an iron hedge of pikes to stop their passage advance they could not nor

lover grave the heartending emotions which this amiable creature has to undergo are described with an almost painful effect the fate of max and thekla might draw tears from the eyes of a stoic less tender but not less sublimely poetical is the fate of wallenstein himself we do not pity wallenstein even in ruin he seems too great for pity his daughter having vanished like a fair vision from the scene we look forward to wallenstein inevitable fate with little feeling save expectant awe this kingly wallenstein whener he falls will drag a world to ruin down with him and as a ship that in the midst of ocean catches fire and shiving springs into the air and in a moment scatters between sea and sky the crew it bore so will he hurry to destruction evy one whose fate was join with his yet still there is some touch of pathos in his gloomy fall some visitings of nature in the austere grandeur of his slowlyoming but inevitable and annihilating doom the last scene of his life is among the finest which poetry can boast of thekla death is still unknown to him but he thinks of max and almost weeps he looks at the stars dim shadows of superstitious dread pass fitfully across his spirit as he views these fountains of light and compares their glorious and enduring existence with the fleeting troubled life of man the strong spirit of his sister is subdued by dark forebodings omens are against him his astrologer entreats one of the relenting conspirators entreats his own feelings call upon him to watch and beware but he refuses to let the resolution of his mind be overmastered he casts away these warnings and goes cheerfully to sleep with dreams of hope about his pillow unconscious that the javelins are already grasped which will send him to his long and dreamless sleep the death of wallenstein does not cause tears but it is perhaps the most highrought scene of the play a shade of horror of fateful dreariness hangs over it and gives additional effect to the fire of that brilliant poetry which glows in every line of it except in macbeth or the conclusion of othello we know not where to match it schiller genius is of a kind much narrower than shakspeare but in his own peculiar province the exciting of lofty earnest strong emotion he admits of no superior others are finer more piercing varied thrilling in their influence schiller in his finest mood is overwhelming this tragedy of wallenstein published at the close of the eighteenth century may safely be rated as the greatest dramatic work of which that century can boast france never rose into the sphere of schiller even in the days of her corneille nor can our own country since the times of elizabeth name any dramatist to be compared with him in general strength of mind and feeling and acquired accomplishment about the time of wallenstein appearance we of this gifted land were shuddering at the castle spectre germany indeed boasts of goethe and on some rare occasions it must be owned that goethe has shown talents of a higher order than are here manifested but he has made no equally regular or powerful exertion of them faust is but a careless effusion compared with wallenstein the latter is in truth a vast and magnificent work what an assemblage of images ideas emotions disposed in the most felicitous and impressive order we have conquerors statesmen ambitious generals marauding soldiers heroes and heroines all acting and feeling as they would in nature all faithfully depicted yet all embellished by the spirit of poetry and all made conducive to heighten one paramount impression our sympathy with the three chief characters of the piece footnote wallenstein has been translated into french by benjamin constant and the last two parts of it have been faithfully rendered into english by mr coleridge as to the french version we know nothing save that it is an improved one but that little is enough schiller as a dramatist improved by constant is a spectacle we feel no wish to witness mr coleridge translation is also as a whole unknown to us but judging from many large specimens we should pronounce it excepting sotheby oberon to be the best indeed the only sufferable translation from the german with which our literature has yet been enriched soon after the publication of wallenstein schiller once more changed his abode the ountain air of jena was conceived by his physicians to be prejudicial in disorders of the lungs and partly in consequence of this opinion he determined henceforth to spend his winters in weimar perhaps a weightier reason in favour of this new arrangement was the opportunity it gave him of being near the theatre a constant attendance on which now that he had once more become a dramatist seemed highly useful for his farther improvement the summer he for several years continued still to spend in jena to which especially its beautiful environs he declared himself particularly attached his little gardenouse was still his place of study during summer till at last he settled constantly at weimar even then he used frequently to visit jena to which there was a fresh attraction in later years when goethe chose it for his residence which we understand it still occasionally is with goethe he often stayed for months this change of place produced little change in schiller habits or employment he was now as formerly in the pay of the duke of weimar now as formerly engaged in dramatic composition as the great object of his life what the amount of his pension was we know not that the prince behaved to him in a princely manner we have proof sufficient four years before when invited to the university of t bingen schiller had received a promise that in case of sickness or any other cause preventing the continuance of his literary labour his salary should be doubled it was actually increased on occasion of the present removal and again still farther in some advantageous offers being made to him from berlin schiller seems to have been what he might have wished to be neither poor nor rich his simple unostentatious economy went on without embarrassment and this was all that he required to avoid pecuniary perplexities was constantly among his aims to amass wealth never we ought also to add that in by the voluntary solicitation of the duke he was ennobled a fact which we mention for his sake by whose kindness this honour was procured not for the sake of schiller who accepted it with gratitude but had neither needed nor desired it the official services expected of him in return for so much kindness seem to have been slight if any chiefly or altogether of his own accord he appears to have applied himself to a close inspection of the theatre and to have shared with goethe the task of superintending its concerns the rehearsals of new pieces commonly took place at the house of one of these friends they consulted together on all such subjects frankly and copiously schiller was not slow to profit by the means of improvement thus afforded him in the mechanical details of his art he grew more skilful by a constant observation of the stage he became more acquainted with its capabilities and its laws it was not long till with his characteristic expansiveness of enterprise he set about turning this new knowledge to account in conjunction with goethe he remodelled his own don carlos and his friend count egmont altering both according to his latest views of scenic propriety it was farther intended to treat in the same manner the whole series of leading german plays and thus to produce a national stock of dramatic pieces formed according to the best rules a vast project in which some progress continued to be made though other labours often interrupted it for the present schiller was engaged with his maria stuart it appeared in this tragedy will not detain us long it is upon a subject the incidents of which are now getting trite and the moral of which has little that can peculiarly recommend it to exhibit the repentance of a lovely but erring woman to show us how her soul may be restored to its primitive nobleness by sufferings devotion and death is the object of maria stuart it is a tragedy of sombre and mournful feelings with an air of melancholy and obstruction pervading it a looking backward on objects of remorse around on imprisonment and forward on the grave its object is undoubtedly attained we are forced to pardon and to love the heroine she is beautiful and miserable and loftyinded and her crimes however dark have been expiated by long years of weeping and woe considering also that they were the fruit not of calculation but of passion acting on a heart not dead though blinded for a time to their enormity they seem less hateful than the cold premeditated villany of which she is the victim elizabeth is selfish heartless envious she violates no law but she has no virtue and she lives triumphant her arid artificial character serves by contrast to heighten our sympathy with her warmearted forlorn illated rival these two queens particularly mary are well delineated their respective qualities are vividly brought out and the feelings they were meant to excite arise within us there is also mortimer a fierce impetuous impassioned lover driven onward chiefly by the heat of his blood but still interesting by his vehemence and unbounded daring the dialogue moreover has many beauties there are scenes which have merited peculiar commendation of this kind is the interview between the queens and more especially the first entrance of mary when after long seclusion she is once more permitted to behold the cheerful sky in the joy of a momentary freedom she forgets that she is still a captive she addresses the clouds the ailors of the air who re not subjects of elizabeth and bids them carry tidings of her to the hearts that love her in other lands without doubt in all that he intended schiller has succeeded maria stuart is a beautiful tragedy it would have formed the glory of a meaner man but it cannot materially alter his compared with wallenstein its purpose is narrow and its result is common we have no manners or true historical delineation the figure of the english court is not given and elizabeth is depicted more like one of the french medici than like our own politic capricious coquettish imperious yet on the whole trueearted queen bess with abundant proofs of genius this tragedy produces a comparatively small effect especially on english readers we have already wept enough for mary stuart both over prose and verse and the persons likely to be deeply touched with the moral or the interest of her story as it is recorded here are rather a separate class than men in general madame de sta we observe is her principal admirer next year schiller took possession of a province more peculiarly his own in appeared his maid of orleans jungfrau von orleans the first hint of which was suggested to him by a series of documents relating to the sentence of jeanne drc and its reversal first published about this time by de lverdy of the acad mie des inscriptions schiller had been moved in perusing them this tragedy gave voice to his feelings considered as an object of poetry or history jeanne drc the most singular personage of modern times presents a character capable of being viewed under a great variety of aspects and with a corresponding variety of emotions to the english of her own age bigoted in their creed and baffled by her prowess she appeared inspired by the devil and was naturally burnt as a sorceress in this light too she is painted in the poems of shakspeare to voltaire again whose trade it was to war with every kind of superstition this child of fanatic ardour seemed no better than a moonstruck zealot and the people who followed her and believed in her something worse than lunatics the glory of what she had achieved was forgotten when the means of achieving it were recollected and the maid of orleans was deemed the fit subject of a poem the wittiest and most profligate for which literature has to blush our illustrious don juan hides his head when contrasted with voltaire pucelle juan biographer with all his zeal is but an innocent and a novice by the side of this archcorner such a manner of considering the maid of orleans is evidently not the right one feelings so deep and earnest as hers can never be an object of ridicule whoever pursues a purpose of any sort with such fervid devotedness is entitled to awaken emotions at least of a serious kind in the hearts of others enthusiasm puts on a different shape in every different age always in some degree sublime often it is dangerous its very essence is a tendency to error and exaggeration yet it is the fundamental quality of strong souls the true nobility of blood in which all greatness of thought or action has its rise quicquid vult vald vult is ever the first and surest test of mental capability this peasant girl who felt within her such fiery vehemence of resolution that she could subdue the minds of kings and captains to her will and lead armies on to battle conquering till her country was cleared of its invaders must evidently have possessed the elements of a majestic character benevolent feelings sublime ideas and above all an overpowering will are here indubitably marked nor does the form which her activity assumed seem less adapted for displaying these qualities than many other forms in which we praise them the gorgeous inspirations of the catholic religion are as real as the phantom of posthumous renown the love of our native soil is as laudable as ambition or the principle of military honour jeanne drc must have been a creature of shadowy yet farlancing dreams of unutterable feelings of houghts that wandered through eternity who can tell the trials and the triumphs the splendours and the terrors of which her simple spirit was the scene eartless sneering godorgetting french as old suwarrow called them they are not worthy of this noble maiden hers were errors but errors which a generous soul alone could have committed and which generous souls would have done more than pardon her darkness and delusions were of the understanding only they but make the radiance of her heart more touching and apparent as clouds are gilded by the orient light into something more beautiful than azure itself it is under this aspect that schiller has contemplated the maid of orleans and endeavoured to make us contemplate her for the latter purpose it appears that more than one plan had occurred to him his first idea was to represent joanna and the times she lived in as they actually were to exhibit the superstition ferocity and wretchedness of the period in all their aggravation and to show us this patriotic and religious enthusiast beautifying the tempestuous scene by her presence swaying the fierce passions of her countrymen directing their fury against the invaders of france till at length forsaken and condemned to die she perished at the stake retaining the same steadfast and lofty faith which had ennobled and redeemed the errors of her life and was now to glorify the ignominy of her death this project after much deliberation he relinquished as too difficult by a new mode of management much of the homeliness and rude horror that defaced and encumbered the reality is thrown away the dauphin is not here a voluptuous weakling nor is his court the centre of vice and cruelty and imbecility the misery of the time is touched but lightly and the maid of arc herself is invested with a certain faint degree of mysterious dignity ultimately represented as being in truth a preternatural gift though whether preternatural and if so whether sent from above or from below neither we nor she except by faith are absolutely sure till the conclusion the propriety of this arrangement is liable to question indeed it has been more than questioned but external blemishes are lost in the intrinsic grandeur of the piece the spirit of joanna is presented to us with an exalting and pathetic force sufficient to make us blind to far greater improprieties joanna is a pure creation of halfelestial origin combining the mild charms of female loveliness with the awful majesty of a prophetess and a sacrifice doomed to perish for her country she resembled in schiller view the iphigenia of the greeks and as such in some respects he has treated her the woes and desolation of the land have kindled in joanna keen and fervent heart a fire which the loneliness of her life and her deep feelings of religion have nourished and fanned into a holy flame she sits in solitude with her flocks beside the mountain chapel of the virgin under the ancient druid oak a wizard spot the haunt of evil spirits as well as of good and visions are revealed to her such as human eyes behold not it seems the force of her own spirit expressing its feelings in forms which react upon itself the strength of her impulses persuades her that she is called from on high to deliver her native france the intensity of her own faith persuades others she goes forth on her mission all bends to the fiery vehemence of her will she is inspired because she thinks herself so there is something beautiful and moving in the aspect of a noble enthusiasm fostered in the secret soul amid obstructions and depressions and at length bursting forth with an overwhelming force to accomplish its appointed end the impediments which long hid it are now become testimonies of its power the very ignorance and meanness and error which still in part adhere to it increase our sympathy without diminishing our admiration it seems the triumph hardly contested and not wholly carried but still the triumph of mind over fate of human volition over material necessity all this schiller felt and has presented with even more than his usual skill the secret mechanism of joanna mind is concealed from us in a dim religious obscurity but its active movements are distinct we behold the lofty heroism of her feelings she affects us to the very heart the quiet devout innocence of her early years when she lived silent shrouded in herself meek and kindly though not communing with others makes us love her the celestial splendour which illuminates her afterife adds reverence to our love her words and actions combine an overpowering force with a calm unpretending dignity we seem to understand how they must have carried in their favour the universal conviction joanna is the most noble being in tragedy we figure her with her slender lovely form her mild but spiritpeaking countenance eautiful and terrible bearing the banner of the virgin before the hosts of her country travelling in the strength of a rapt soul irresistible by faith he lowly herdsmaid greater in the grandeur of her simple spirit than the kings and queens of this world yet her breast is not entirely insensible to human feeling nor her faith never liable to waver when that inexorable vengeance which had shut her ear against the voice of mercy to the enemies of france is suspended at the sight of lionel and her heart experiences the first touch of mortal affection a baleful cloud overspreads the serene of her mind it seems as if heaven had forsaken her or from the beginning permitted demons or earthly dreams to deceive her the agony of her spirit involved in endless and horrid labyrinths of doubt is powerfully portrayed she has crowned the king at rheims and all is joy and pomp and jubilee and almost adoration of joanna but joanna thoughts are not of joy the sight of her poor but kind and trueearted sisters in the crowd moves her to the soul amid the tumult and magnificence of this royal pageant she sinks into a reverie her small native dale of arc between its quiet hills rises on her mind eye with its strawoofed huts and its clear greensward where the sun is even then shining so brightly and the sky is so blue and all is so calm and motherly and safe she sighs for the peace of that sequestered home then shudders to think that she shall never see it more accused of witchcraft by her own ascetic melancholic father she utters no word of denial to the charge for her heart is dark it is tarnished by earthly love she dare not raise her thoughts to heaven parted from her sisters cast out with horror by the people she had lately saved from despair she wanders forth desolate forlorn not knowing whither yet she does not sink under this sore trial as she suffers from without and is forsaken of men her mind grows clear and strong her confidence returns she is now more firmly fixed in our admiration than before tenderness is united to our other feelings and her faith has been proved by sharp vicissitudes her countrymen recognise their error joanna closes her career by a glorious death we take farewell of her in a solemn mood of heroic pity joanna is the animating principle of this tragedy the scenes employed in developing her character and feelings constitute its great charm yet there are other personages in it that leave a distinct and pleasing impression of themselves in our memory agnes sorel the soft languishing generous mistress of the dauphin relieves and heightens by comparison the sterner beauty of the maid dunois the bastard of orleans the lover of joanna is a blunt frank sagacious soldier and well described and talbot the gray veteran delineates his dark unbelieving indomitable soul by a few slight but expressive touches he sternly passes down to the land as he thinks of utter nothingness contemptuous even of the fate that destroys him and n the soil of france he sleeps as does a hero on the shield he would not quit a few scattered extracts may in part exhibit some of these inferior personages to our readers though they can afford us no impression of the maid herself joanna character like every finished piece of art to be judged of must be seen in all its bearings it is not in parts but as a whole that the delineation moves us by light and manifold touches it works upon our hearts till they melt before it into that mild rapture free alike from the violence and the impurities of nature which it is the highest triumph of the artist to communicate act scene the dauphin charles with his suite afterwards joanna she is in armour but without her helmet and wears a garland in her hair dunois steps forward my heart made choice of her while she was lowly this new honour raises not her

schlegel we recollect calls joanna end a osy death in this dramaturgic discussion the mere reader need take no great interest to require our belief in apparitions and miracles things which we cannot now believe no doubt for a moment disturbs our submission to the poet illusions but the miracles in this story are rare and transient and of small account in the general result they give our reason little trouble and perhaps contribute to exalt the heroine in our imaginations it is still the mere human grandeur of joanna spirit that we love and reverence the lofty devotedness with which she is transported the generous benevolence the irresistible determination the heavenly mandate is but the means of unfolding these qualities and furnishing them with a proper passport to the minds of her age to have produced without the aid of fictions like these a joanna so beautified and exalted would undoubtedly have yielded greater satisfaction but it may be questioned whether the difficulty would not have increased in a still higher ratio the sentiments the characters are not only accurate but exquisitely beautiful the incidents excepting the very last are possible or even probable what remains is but a very slender evil after all objections have been urged and this among others has certainly a little weight the maid of orleans will remain one of the very finest of modern dramas perhaps among all schiller plays it is the one which evinces most of that quality denominated genius in the strictest meaning of the word wallenstein embodies more thought more knowledge more conception but it is only in parts illuminated by that ethereal brightness which shines over every part of this the spirit of the romantic ages is here imaged forth but the whole is exalted embellished ennobled it is what the critics call idealised the heart must be cold the imagination dull which the jungfrau von orleans will not move in germany this case did not occur the reception of the work was beyond example flattering the leading idea suited the german mind the execution of it inflamed the hearts and imaginations of the people they felt proud of their great poet and delighted to enthusiasm with his poetry at the first exhibition of the play in leipzig schiller being in the theatre though not among the audience this feeling was displayed in a rather singular manner when the curtain dropped at the end of the first act there arose on all sides a shout of es lebe friedrich schiller accompanied by the sound of trumpets and other military music at the conclusion of the piece the whole assembly left their places went out and crowded round the door through which the poet was expected to come and no sooner did he show himself than his admiring spectators uncovering their heads made an avenue for him to pass and as he waited along many we are told held up their children and exclaimed that is he footnote doering p who adds as follows nother testimony of approval very different in its nature he received at the first production of the play in weimar knowing and valuing as he did the public of that city it could not but surprise him greatly when a certain young doctor s called out to him bravo schiller from the gallery in a very loud tone of voice offended at such impertinence the poet hissed strongly in which the audience joined him he likewise expressed in words his displeasure at this conduct and the youthful sprig of medicine was by direction of the court farther punished for his indiscreet applause by some admonitions from the police this must have been a proud moment for schiller but also an agitating painful one and perhaps on the whole the latter feeling for the time prevailed such noisy formal and tumultuous plaudits were little to his taste the triumph they confer though plentiful is coarse and schiller modest nature made him shun the public gaze not seek it he loved men and did not affect to despise their approbation but neither did this form his leading motive to him art like virtue was its own reward he delighted in his tasks for the sake of the fascinating feelings which they yielded him in their performance poetry was the chosen gift of his mind which his pleasure lay in cultivating in other things he wished not that his habits or enjoyments should be different from those of other men at weimar his present way of life was like his former one at jena his business was to study and compose his recreations were in the circle of his family where he could abandon himself to affections grave or trifling and in frank and cheerful intercourse with a few friends of the latter he had lately formed a social club the meetings of which afforded him a regular and innocent amusement he still loved solitary walks in the park at weimar he might frequently be seen wandering among the groves and remote avenues with a noteook in his hand now loitering slowly along now standing still now moving rapidly on if any one appeared in sight he would dart into another alley that his dream might not be broken ne of his favourite resorts we are told as the thicklyvershadowed rocky path which leads to the r mische haus a pleasureouse of the duke built under the direction of goethe there he would often sit in the gloom of the crags overgrown with cypresses and boxwood shady hedges before him not far from the murmur of a little brook which there gushes in a smooth slaty channel and where some verses of goethe are cut upon a brown plate of stone and fixed in the rock he still continued to study in the night the morning was spent with his children and his wife or in pastimes such as we have noticed in the afternoon he revised what had been last composed wrote letters or visited his friends his evenings were often passed in the theatre it was the only public place of amusement which he ever visited nor was it for the purpose of amusement that he visited this it was his observatory where he watched the effect of scenes and situations devised new schemes of art or corrected old ones to the players he was kind friendly on nights when any of his pieces had been acted successfully or for the first time he used to invite the leaders of the company to a supper in the stadthaus where the time was spent in mirthful diversions one of which was frequently a recitation by genast of the capuchin sermon in wallenstein camp except on such rare occasions he returned home directly from the theatre to light his midnight lamp and commence the most earnest of his labours footnote hatever he intended to write he first composed in his head before putting down a line of it on paper he used to call a work ready so soon as its existence in his spirit was complete hence in the public there often were reports that such and such a piece of his was finished when in the common sense it was not even begun j rdens lexicon schiller the assiduity with which he struggled for improvement in dramatic composition had now produced its natural result the requisitions of his taste no longer hindered the operation of his genius art had at length become a second nature a new proof at once of his fertility and of his solicitude for farther improvement appeared in the braut von messina was an experiment an attempt to exhibit a modern subject and modern sentiments in an antique garb the principle on which the interest of this play rests is the fatalism of the ancients the plot is of extreme simplicity a chorus also is introduced an elaborate discussion of the nature and uses of that accompaniment being prefixed by way of preface the experiment was not successful with a multitude of individual beauties this bride of messina is found to be ineffectual as a whole it does not move us the great object of every tragedy is not attained the chorus which schiller swerving from the greek models has divided into two contending parts and made to enter and depart with the principals to whom they are attached has in his hands become the medium of conveying many beautiful effusions of poetry but it retards the progress of the plot it dissipates and diffuses our sympathies the interest we should take in the fate and prospects of manuel and sar is expended on the fate and prospects of man for beautiful and touching delineations of life for pensive and pathetic reflections sentiments and images conveyed in language simple but nervous and emphatic this tragedy stands high in the rank of modern compositions there is in it a breath of young tenderness and ardour mingled impressively with the feelings of grayaired experience whose recollections are darkened with melancholy whose very hopes are chequered and solemn the implacable destiny which consigns the brothers to mutual enmity and mutual destruction for the guilt of a past generation involving a mother and a sister in their ruin spreads a sombre hue over all the poem we are not unmoved by the characters of the hostile brothers and we pity the hapless and amiable beatrice the victim of their feud still there is too little action in the play the incidents are too abundantly diluted with reflection the interest pauses flags and fails to produce its full effect for its specimens of lyrical poetry tender affecting sometimes exquisitely beautiful the bride of messina will long deserve a careful perusal but as exemplifying a new form of the drama it has found no imitators and is likely to find none the slight degree of failure or miscalculation which occurred in the present instance was next year abundantly redeemed wilhelm tell sent out in is one of schiller very finest dramas it exhibits some of the highest triumphs which his genius combined with his art ever realised the first descent of freedom to our modern world the first unfurling of her standard on the rocky pinnacle of europe is here celebrated in the style which it deserved there is no false timselecoration about tell no sickly refinement no declamatory sentimentality all is downright simple and agreeable to nature yet all is adorned and purified and rendered beautiful without losing its resemblance an air of freshness and wholesomeness breathes over it we are among honest inoffensive yet fearless peasants untainted by the vices undazzled by the theories of more complex and perverted conditions of society the opening of the first scene sets us down among the alps it is high rocky shore of the luzern lake opposite to schwytz the lake makes a little bight in the land a hut stands at a short distance from the bank the fisheroy is rowing himself about in his boat beyond the lake on the other side we see the green meadows the hamlets and farms of schwytz lying in the clear sunshine on our left are observed the peaks of the hacken surrounded with clouds to the right and far in the distance appear the glaciers we hear the rance des vaches and the tinkling of cattleells this first impression never leaves us we are in a scene where all is grand and lovely but it is the loveliness and grandeur of unpretending unadulterated nature these switzers are not arcadian shepherds or speculative patriots there is not one crook or beechen bowl among them and they never mention the social contract or the rights of man they are honest people driven by oppression to assert their privileges and they go to work like men in earnest bent on the despatch of business not on the display of sentiment they are not philosophers or tribunes but frank stalwart landmen even in the field of r tli they do not forget their common feelings the party that arrive first indulge in a harmless little ebullition of parish vanity we are first here they say we unterwaldeners they have not charters or written laws to which they can appeal but they have the traditionary rights of their fathers and bold hearts and strong arms to make them good the rules by which they steer are not deduced from remote premises by a fine process of thought they are the accumulated result of experience transmitted from peasant sire to peasant son there is something singularly pleasing in this exhibition of genuine humanity of wisdom embodied in old adages and practical maxims of prudence of magnanimity displayed in the quiet unpretending discharge of the humblest everyay duties truth is superior to fiction we feel at home among these brave good people their fortune interests us more than that of all the brawling vapid sentimental heroes in creation yet to make them interest us was the very highest problem of art it was to copy lowly nature to give us a copy of it embellished and refined by the agency of genius yet preserving the likeness in every lineament the highest quality of art is to conceal itself these peasants of schiller are what every one imagines he could imitate successfully yet in the hands of any but a true and stronginded poet they dwindle into repulsive coarseness or mawkish insipidity among our own writers who have tried such subjects we remember none that has succeeded equally with schiller one potent but illated genius has in far different circumstances and with far other means shown that he could have equalled him the cotter saturday night of burns is in its own humble way as quietly beautiful as simplex munditiis as the scenes of tell no other has even approached them though some gifted persons have attempted it mr wordsworth is no ordinary man nor are his pedlars and leechatherers and dalesmen without their attractions and their moral but they sink into whining drivellers beside r the priest ulric the smith hans of the wall and the other sturdy confederates of r tli the skill with which the events are concatenated in this play corresponds to the truth of its delineation of character the incidents of the swiss revolution as detailed in tschudi or are here faithfully preserved even to their minutest branches the beauty of schiller descriptions all can relish their fidelity is what surprises every reader who has been in switzerland schiller never saw the scene of his play but his diligence his quickness and intensity of conception supplied this defect mountain and mountaineer conspiracy and action are all brought before us in their true forms all glowing in the mild sunshine of the poet fancy the tyranny of gessler and the misery to which it has reduced the land the exasperation yet patient courage of the people their characters and those of their leaders f rst stauffacher and melchthal their exertions and ultimate success described as they are here keep up a constant interest in the piece it abounds in action as much as the bride of messina is defective in that point but the finest delineation is undoubtedly the character of wilhelm tell the hero of the swiss revolt and of the present drama in tell are combined all the attributes of a great man without the help of education or of great occasions to develop them his knowledge has been gathered chiefly from his own experience and this is bounded by his native mountains he has had no lessons or examples of splendid virtue no wish or opportunity to earn renown he has grown up to manhood a simple yeoman of the alps among simple yeomen and has never aimed at being more yet we trace in him a deep reflective earnest spirit thirsting for activity yet bound in by the wholesome dictates of prudence a heart benevolent generous unconscious alike of boasting or of fear it is this salubrious air of rustic unpretending honesty that forms the great beauty in tell character all is native all is genuine he does not declaim he dislikes to talk of noble conduct he exhibits it he speaks little of his freedom because he has always enjoyed it and feels that he can always defend it his reasons for destroying gessler are not drawn from jurisconsults and writers on morality but from the everlasting instincts of nature the austrian vogt must die because if not the wife and children of tell will be destroyed by him the scene where the peaceful but indomitable archer sits waiting for gessler in the hollow way among the rocks of k presents him in a striking light former scenes had shown us tell under many amiable and attractive aspects we knew that he was tender as well as brave that he loved to haunt the mountain tops and inhale in silent dreams the influence of their wild and magnificent beauty we had seen him the most manly and warmearted of fathers and husbands intrepid modest and decisive in the midst of peril and venturing his life to bring help to the oppressed but here his mind is exalted into stern solemnity its principles of action come before us with greater clearness in this its fiery contest the name of murder strikes a damp across his frank and fearless spirit while the recollection of his children and their mother proclaims emphatically that there is no remedy gessler must perish tell swore it darkly in his secret soul when the monster forced him to aim at the head of his boy and he will keep his oath his thoughts wander to and fro but his volition is unalterable the free and peaceful mountaineer is to become a shedder of blood woe to them that have made him so travellers come along the pass the unconcern of their everyay existence is strikingly contrasted with the dark and fateful purposes of tell the shallow innocent garrulity of st the forester the maternal vehemence of armgart wife the hardearted haughtiness of gessler successively presented to us give an air of truth to the delineation and deepen the impressiveness of the result act scene the hollow way at k you descend from behind amid rocks and travellers before appearing on the scene are seen from the height above rocks encircle the whole space on one of the foremost is a projecting crag overgrown with brushwood tell enters with his bow here through the hollow way hel pass there is no other road to k here il do it the opportunity is good the bushes of alder there will hide me from that point my arrow hits him the strait pass prevents pursuit now gessler balance thy account with heaven thou must be gone thy sand is run remote and harmless i have my bow ner bent save on the wild beast of the forest my thoughts were free of murder thou hast scar me from my peace to fell aspoison hast thou changed the milk of kindly temper in me thou hast accustom me to horrors gessler the archer who could aim at his boy head can send an arrow to his enemy heart poor little boys my kind true wife i will protect them from thee landvogt when i drew that bowstring and my hand was quiving and with devilish joy thou madt me point it at the child and i in fainting anguish entreated thee in vain then with a grim irrevocable oath deep in my soul i vow to god in heav that the next aim i took should be thy heart the vow i made in that despairing moment agony became a holy debt and i will pay it thou art my master and my kaiser vogt yet would the kaiser not have suffer thee to do as thou hast done he sent thee hither to judge us rigorously for he is angry but not to glut thy savage appetite with murder and thyself be safe among us there is a god to punish them that wrong

piercing now or never fail this there is no second in my quiver travellers cross the scene here let me sit on this stone bench set up for brief rest to the wayfarer for here there is no home each pushes on quick transient regarding not the other or his sorrows here goes the anxious merchant and the light unmoneyed pilgrim the pale pious monk the gloomy robber and the mirthful showman the carrier with his heavyaden horse who comes from farff lands for every road will lead one to the end o th world they pass each hastening forward on his path pursuing his own business mine is death sits down erewhile my children were your father out there was a merriment at his return for still on coming home he brought you somewhat might be an alpine flower rare bird or elfolt such as the wander finds upon the mountains now he is gone in quest of other spoil on the wild way he sits with thoughts of murder is for his enemy life he lies in wait and yet on you dear children you alone he thinks as then for your sake is he here to guard you from the tyrant vengeful mood he bends his peaceful bow for work of blood rises no common game i watch for does the hunter think it nought to roam the livelong day in winter cold to risk the despate leap from crag to crag to climb the slippy face o th dizzy steep glueing his steps in blood and all to catch a pitiful chamois here is a richer prize

took the bullye many a prize brought home from merry shooting but today i will perform my mastereat and win me the best prize in the circuit of the hills
