several times barefoot and computing by the scale measured it pretty exactly the king s palace is no regular edifice but a heap of buildings about seven miles round the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty feet high and broad and long in proportion a coach was allowed to glumdalclitch and me wherein her governess frequently took her out to see the town or go among the shops and i was always of the party carried in my box although the girl at my own desire would often take me out and hold me in her hand that i might more conveniently view the houses and the people as we passed along the streets i reckoned our coach to be about a square of westminsterall but not altogether so high however i cannot be very exact one day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops where the beggars watching their opportunity crowded to the sides of the coach and gave me the most horrible spectacle that ever a european eye beheld there was a woman with a cancer in her breast swelled to a monstrous size full of holes in two or three of which i could have easily crept and covered my whole body there was a fellow with a wen in his neck larger than five woolacks and another with a couple of wooden legs each about twenty feet high but the most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes i could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye much better than those of a european louse through a microscope and their snouts with which they rooted like swine they were the first i had ever beheld and i should have been curious enough to dissect one of them if i had had proper instruments which i unluckily left behind me in the ship although indeed the sight was so nauseous that it perfectly turned my stomach besides the large box in which i was usually carried the queen ordered a smaller one to be made for me of about twelve feet square and ten high for the convenience of travelling because the other was somewhat too large for glumdalclitch s lap and cumbersome in the coach it was made by the same artist whom i directed in the whole contrivance this travellingloset was an exact square with a window in the middle of three of the squares and each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside to prevent accidents in long journeys on the fourth side which had no window two strong staples were fixed through which the person that carried me when i had a mind to be on horseback put a leathern belt and buckled it about his waist this was always the office of some grave trusty servant in whom i could confide whether i attended the king and queen in their progresses or were disposed to see the gardens or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order for i soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers i suppose more upon account of their majesties favour than any merit of my own in journeys when i was weary of the coach a servant on horseback would buckle on my box and place it upon a cushion before him and there i had a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows i had in this closet a fielded and a hammock hung from the ceiling two chairs and a table neatly screwed to the floor to prevent being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach and having been long used to seaoyages those motions although sometimes very violent did not much discompose me whenever i had a mind to see the town it was always in my travellingloset which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan after the fashion of the country borne by four men and attended by two others in the queen s livery the people who had often heard of me were very curious to crowd about the sedan and the girl was complaisant enough to make the bearers stop and to take me in her hand that i might be more conveniently seen i was very desirous to see the chief temple and particularly the tower belonging to it which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither but i may truly say i came back disappointed for the height is not above three thousand feet reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top which allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in europe is no great matter for admiration nor at all equal in proportion if i rightly remembe to salisbury steeple but not to detract from a nation to which during my life i shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength for the walls are near a hundred feet thick built of hewn stone whereof each is about forty feet square and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life placed in their several niches i measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues and lay unperceived among some rubbish and found it exactly four feet and an inch in length glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief and carried it home in her pocket to keep among other trinkets of which the girl was very fond as children at her age usually are the king s kitchen is indeed a noble building vaulted at top and about six hundred feet high the great oven is not so wide by ten paces as the cupola at st paul s for i measured the latter on purpose after my return but if i should describe the kitchen grate the prodigious pots and kettles the joints of meat turning on the spits with many other particulars perhaps i should be hardly believed at least a severe critic would be apt to think i enlarged a little as travellers are often suspected to do to avoid which censure i fear i have run too much into the other extreme and that if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of brobdingnag which is the general name of that kingdom and transmitted thither the king and his people would have reason to complain that i had done them an injury by a false and diminutive representation his majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables they are generally from fiftyour to sixty feet high but when he goes abroad on solemn days he is attended for state by a military guard of five hundred horse which indeed i thought was the most splendid sight that could be ever beheld till i saw part of his army in battalia whereof i shall find another occasion to speak chapter several adventurers that happened to the author the execution of a criminal the author shows his skill in navigation i should have lived happy enough in that country if my littleness had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents some of which i shall venture to relate glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box and would sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand or set me down to walk i remember before the dwarf left the queen he followed us one day into those gardens and my nurse having set me down he and i being close together near some dwarf apple trees i must needs show my wit by a silly allusion between him and the trees which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours whereupon the malicious rogue watching his opportunity when i was walking under one of them shook it directly over my head by which a dozen apples each of them near as large as a bristol barrel came tumbling about my ears one of them hit me on the back as i chanced to stoop and knocked me down flat on my face but i received no other hurt and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire because i had given the provocation another day glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grasslot to divert myself while she walked at some distance with her governess in the meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail that i was immediately by the force of it struck to the ground and when i was down the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if i had been pelted with tennisalls however i made a shift to creep on all fours and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the leeide of a border of lemonhyme but so bruised from head to foot that i could not go abroad in ten days neither is this at all to be wondered at because nature in that country observing the same proportion through all her operations a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as one in europe which i can assert upon experience having been so curious as to weigh and measure them but a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden when my little nurse believing she had put me in a secure place which i often entreated her to do that i might enjoy my own thoughts and having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it went to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance while she was absent and out of hearing a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners having got by accident into the garden happened to range near the place where i lay the dog following the scent came directly up and taking me in his mouth ran straight to his master wagging his tail and set me gently on the ground by good fortune he had been so well taught that i was carried between his teeth without the least hurt or even tearing my clothes but the poor gardener who knew me well and had a great kindness for me was in a terrible fright he gently took me up in both his hands and asked me how i did but i was so amazed and out of breath that i could not speak a word in a few minutes i came to myself and he carried me safe to my little nurse who by this time had returned to the place where she left me and was in cruel agonies when i did not appear nor answer when she called she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog but the thing was hushed up and never known at court for the girl was afraid of the queen s anger and truly as to myself i thought it would not be for my reputation that such a story should go about this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight i had been long afraid of this resolution and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky adventures that happened in those times when i was left by myself once a kite hovering over the garden made a stoop at me and if i had not resolutely drawn my hanger and run under a thick espalier he would have certainly carried me away in his talons another time walking to the top of a fresh moleill i fell to my neck in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth and coined some lie not worth remembering to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes i likewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail which i happened to stumble over as i was walking alone and thinking on poor england i cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid of me but would hop about within a yard s distance looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and security as if no creature at all were near them i remember a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a of cake that glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast when i attempted to catch any of these birds they would boldly turn against me endeavouring to peck my fingers which i durst not venture within their reach and then they would hop back unconcerned to hunt for worms or snails as they did before but one day i took a thick cudgel and threw it with all my strength so luckily at a linnet that i knocked him down and seizing him by the neck with both my hands ran with him in triumph to my nurse however the bird who had only been stunned recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body though i held him at arm sength and was out of the reach of his claws that i was twenty times thinking to let him go but i was soon relieved by one of our servants who wrung off the bird s neck and i had him next day for dinner by the queen s command this linnet as near as i can remember seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swan the maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments and desired she would bring me along with her on purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me they would often strip me naked from top to toe and lay me at full length in their bosoms wherewith i was much disgusted because to say the truth a very offensive smell came from their skins which i do not mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies for whom i have all manner of respect but i conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness and that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers or to each other than people of the same quality are with us in england and after all i found their natural smell was much more supportable than when they used perfumes under which i immediately swooned away i cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput took the freedom in a warm day when i had used a good deal of exercise to complain of a strong smell about me although i am as little faulty that way as most of my sex but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me as mine was to that of this people upon this point i cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress and glumdalclitch my nurse whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady in england that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour when my nurse carried me to visit the was to see them use me without any manner of ceremony like a creature who had no sort of consequence for they would strip themselves to the skin and put on their smocks in my presence while i was placed on their toilet directly before their naked bodies which i am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust their skins appeared so coarse and uneven so variously coloured when i saw them near with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads to say nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons neither did they at all scruple while i was by to discharge what they had drank to the quantity of at least two hogsheads in a vessel that held above three tuns the handsomest among these maids of honour a pleasant frolicsome girl of sixteen would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples with many other tricks wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular but i was so much displeased that i entreated glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more one day a young gentleman who was nephew to my nurse s governess came and pressed them both to see an execution it was of a man who had murdered one of that gentleman s intimate acquaintance glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company very much against her inclination for she was naturally tenderearted and as for myself although i abhorred such kind of spectacles yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that i thought must be extraordinary the malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose and his head cut off at one blow with a sword of about forty feet long the veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood and so high in the air that the great jet eau at versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted and the head when it fell on the scaffold floor gave such a bounce as made me start although i was at least half an english mile distant the queen who often used to hear me talk of my seaoyages and took all occasions to divert me when i was melancholy asked me whether i understood how to handle a sail or an oar and whether a little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health i answered that i understood both very well for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship yet often upon a pinch i was forced to work like a common mariner but i could not see how this could be done in their country where the smallest wherry was equal to a firstate man of war among us and such a boat as i could manage would never live in any of their rivers her majesty said if i would contrive a boat her own joiner should make it and she would provide a place for me to sail in the fellow was an ingenious workman and by my instructions in ten days finished a pleasureoat with all its tackling able conveniently to hold eight europeans when it was finished the queen was so delighted that she ran with it in her lap to the king who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water with me in it by way of trial where i could not manage my two sculls or little oars for want of room but the queen had before contrived another project she ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long fifty broad and eight deep which being well pitched to prevent leaking was placed on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the palace it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour here i often used to row for my own diversion as well as that of the queen and her ladies who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility sometimes i would put up my sail and then my business was only to steer while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans and when they were weary some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath while i showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as i pleased when i had done glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet and hung it on a nail to dry in this exercise i once met an accident which had like to have cost me my life for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough the governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up to place me in the boat but i happened to slip through her fingers and should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor if by the luckiest chance in the world i had not been stopped by a corkingin that stuck in the good gentlewoman s stomacher the head of the pin passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches and thus i was held by the middle in the air till glumdalclitch ran to my relief another time one of the servants whose office it was to fill my trough every third day with fresh water was so careless as to let a huge frog not perceiving i slip out of his pail the frog lay concealed till i was put into my boat but then seeing a restinglace climbed up and made it lean so much on one side that i was forced to balance it with all my weight on the other to prevent overturning when the frog was got in it hopped at once half the length of the boat and then over my head backward and forward daubing my face and clothes with its odious slime the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be conceived however i desired glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone i banged it a good while with one of my sculls and at last forced it to leap out of the boat but the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom was from a monkey who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet while she went somewhere upon business or a visit the weather being very warm the closetindow was left open as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box in which i usually lived because of its largeness and conveniency as i sat quietly meditating at my table i heard something bounce in at the closetindow and skip about from one side to the other whereat although i was much alarmed yet i ventured to look out but not stirring from my seat and then i saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down till at last he came to my box which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity peeping in at the door and every window i retreated to the farther corner of my room or box but the monkey looking in at every side put me in such a fright that i wanted presence of mind to conceal myself under the bed as i might easily have done after some time spent in peeping grinning and chattering he at last espied me and reaching one of his paws in at the door as a cat does when she plays with a mouse although i often shifted place to avoid him he at length seized the lappet of my coat which being made of that country silk was very thick and stron and dragged me out he took me up in his right foreoot and held me as a nurse does a child she is going to suckle just as i have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in europe and when i offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard that i thought it more prudent to submit i have good reason to believe that he took me for a young one of his own species by his often stroking my face very gently with his other paw in these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the closet door as if somebody were opening it whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in and thence upon the leads and gutters walking upon three legs and holding me in the fourth till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out the poor girl was almost distracted that quarter of the palace was all in an uproar the servants ran for ladders the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court sitting upon the ridge of a building holding me like a baby in one of his forepaws and feeding me with the other by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his chaps and patting me when i would not eat whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing neither do i think they justly ought to be blamed for without question the sight was ridiculous enough to every body but myself some of the people threw up stones hoping to drive the monkey down but this was strictly forbidden or else very probably my brains had been dashed out the ladders were now applied and mounted by several men which the monkey observing and finding himself almost encompassed not being able to make speed enough with his three legs let me drop on a ridge tile and made his escape here i sat for some time five hundred yards from the ground expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind or to fall by my own giddiness and come tumbling over and over from the ridge to the eaves but an honest lad one of my nurse s footmen climbed up and putting me into his breeches pocket brought me down safe i was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle and then i fell aomiting which gave me great relief yet i was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal that i was forced to keep my bed a fortnight the king queen and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness the monkey was killed and an order made that no such animal should be kept about the palace when i attended the king after my recovery to return him thanks for his favours he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure he asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while i lay in the monkey s paw how i liked the victuals he gave me his manner of feeding and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach he desired to know what i would have done upon such an occasion in my own country i told his majesty that in europe we had no monkeys except such as were brought for curiosity from other places and so small that i could deal with a dozen of them together if they presumed to attack me and as for that monstrous animal with whom i was so lately engaged it was indeed as large as an elephan if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger looking fiercely and clapping my hand on the hilt as i spok when he poked his paw into my chamber perhaps i should have given him such a wound as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in this i delivered in a firm tone like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be called in question however my speech produced nothing else beside a loud laughter which all the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make them contain this made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him and yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england since my return where a little contemptible varlet without the least title to birth person wit or common sense shall presume to look with importance and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom i was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story and glumdalclitch although she loved me to excess yet was arch enough to inform the queen whenever i committed any folly that she thought would be diverting to her majesty the girl who had been out of order was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour s distance or thirty miles from town they alighted out of the coach near a small footath in a field and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box i went out of it to walk there was a cowung in the path and i must need try my activity by attempting to leap over it i took a run but unfortunately jumped short and found myself just in the middle up to my knees i waded through with some difficulty and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief for i was filthily bemired and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned home where the queen was soon informed of what had passed and the footmen spread it about the court so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense chapter several contrivances of the author to please the king and queen he shows his skill in music the king inquires into the state of england which the author relates to him the king s observations thereon i used to attend the king s levee once or twice a week and had often seen him under the barber s hand which indeed was at first very terrible to behold for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe his majesty according to the custom of the country was only shaved twice aeek i once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair i then took a piece of fine wood and cut it like the back of a comb making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a needle as i could get from glumdalclitch i fixed in the stumps so artificially scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points that i made a very tolerable comb which was a seasonable supply my own being so much broken in the teeth that it was almost useless neither did i know any artist in that country so nice and exact as would undertake to make me another and this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein i spent many of my leisure hours i desired the queen s woman to save for me the combings of her majesty s hair whereof in time i got a good quantity and consulting with my friend the cabinetaker who had received general orders to do little jobs for me i directed him to make two chairrames no larger than those i had in my box and to bore little holes with a fine awl round those parts where i designed the backs and seats through these holes i wove the strongest hairs i could pick out just after the manner of cane chairs in england when they were finished i made a present of them to her majesty who kept them in her cabinet and used to show them for curiosities as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them the queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs but i absolutely refused to obey her protesting i would rather die than place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs that once adorned her majesty s head of these hairs as i had always a mechanical geniu i likewise made a neat little purse about five feet long with her majesty s name deciphered in gold letters which i gave to glumdalclitch by the queen s consent to say the truth it was more for show than use being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger coins and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that girls are fond of the king who delighted in music had frequent concerts at court to which i was sometimes carried and set in my box on a table to hear them but the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes i am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army beating and sounding together just at your ears could not equal it my practice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat as far as i could then to shut the doors and windows of it and draw the window curtains after which i found their music not disagreeable i had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber and a master attended twice aeek to teach her i called it a spinet because it somewhat resembled that instrument and was played upon in the same manner a fancy came into my head that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon this instrument but this appeared extremely difficult for the spinet was near sixty feet long each key being almost a foot wide so that with my arms extended i could not reach to above five keys and to press them down required a good smart stroke with my fist which would be too great a labour and to no purpose the method i contrived was this i prepared two round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels they were thicker at one end than the other and i covered the thicker ends with pieces of a mouse s skin that by rapping on them i might neither damage the tops of the keys nor interrupt the sound before the spinet a bench was placed about four feet below the keys and i was put upon the bench i ran sideling upon it that way and this as fast as i could banging the proper keys with my two sticks and made a shift to play a jig to the great satisfaction of both their majesties but it was the most violent exercise i ever underwent and yet i could not strike above sixteen keys nor consequently play the bass and treble together as other artists do which was a great disadvantage to my performance the king who as i before observed was a prince of excellent understanding would frequently order that i should be brought in my box and set upon the table in his closet he would then command me to bring one of my chairs out of the box and sit down within three yards distance upon the top of the cabinet which brought me almost to a level with his face in this manner i had several conversations with him i one day took the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt he discovered towards europe and the rest of the world did not seem answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of that reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body on the contrary we observed in our country that the tallest persons were usually the least provided with it that among other animals bees and ants had the reputation of more industry art and sagacity than many of the larger kinds and that as inconsiderable as he took me to be i hoped i might live to do his majesty some signal service the king heard me with attention and began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before he desired i would give him as exact an account of the government of england as i possibly could because as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my former discourse he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation imagine with thyself courteous reader how often i then wished for the tongue of demosthenes or cicero that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits and felicity i began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions consisted of two islands which composed three mighty kingdoms under one sovereign beside our plantations in america i dwelt long upon the fertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate i then spoke at large upon the constitution of an english parliament partly made up of an illustrious body called the house of peers persons of the noblest blood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies i described that extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom to have a share in the legislature to be members of the highest court of judicature whence there can be no appeal and to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country by their valour conduct and fidelity that these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors whose honour had been the reward of their virtue from which their posterity were never once known to degenerate to these were joined several holy persons as part of that assembly under the title of bishops whose peculiar business is to take care of religion and of those who instruct the people therein these were searched and sought out through the whole nation by the prince and his wisest counsellors among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of their lives and the depth of their erudition who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people that the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly called the house of commons who were all principal gentlemen freely picked and culled out by the people themselves for their great abilities and love of their country to represent the wisdom of the whole nation and that these two bodies made up the most august assembly in europe to whom in conjunction with the prince the whole legislature is committed i then descended to the courts of justice over which the judges those venerable sages and interpreters of the law presided for determining the disputed rights and properties of men as well as for the punishment of vice and protection of innocence i mentioned the prudent management of our treasury the valour and achievements of our forces by sea and land i computed the number of our people by reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect or political party among us i did not omit even our sports and pastimes or any other particular which i thought might redound to the honour of my country and i finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in england for about a hundred years past this conversation was not ended under five audiences each of several hours and the king heard the whole with great attention frequently taking notes of what i spoke as well as memorandums of what questions he intended to ask me when i had put an end to these long discources his majesty in a sixth audience consulting his notes proposed many doubts queries and objections upon every article he asked what methods were used to cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility and in what kind of business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their lives what course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble family became extinct what qualifications were necessary in those who are to be created new lords whether the humour of the prince a sum of money to a court lady or a design of strengthening a party opposite to the public interest ever happened to be the motive in those advancements what share of knowledge these lords had in the laws of their country and how they came by it so as to enable them to decide the properties of their fellowubjects in the last resort whether they were always so free from avarice partialities or want that a bribe or some other sinister view could have no place among them whether those holy lords i spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of their lives had never been compliers with the times while they were common priests or slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman whose opinions they continued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that assembly he then desired to know what arts were practised in electing those whom i called commoners whether a stranger with a strong purse might not influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord or the most considerable gentleman in the neighbourhood how it came to pass that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly which i allowed to be a great trouble and expense often to the ruin of their families without any salary or pension because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit that his majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere and he desired to know whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges and trouble they were at by sacrificing the public good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction with a corrupted ministry he multiplied his questions and sifted me thoroughly upon every part of this head proposing numberless inquiries and objections which i think it not prudent or convenient to repeat upon what i said in relation to our courts of justice his majesty desired to be satisfied in several points and this i was the better able to do having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery which was decreed for me with costs he asked what time was usually spent in determining between right and wrong and what degree of expense whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust vexatious or oppressive whether party in religion or politics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice whether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity or only in provincial national and other local customs whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing upon at their pleasure whether they had ever at different times pleaded for and against the same cause and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions whether they were a rich or a poor corporation whether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering their opinions and particularly whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate he fell next upon the management of our treasury and said he thought my memory had failed me because i computed our taxes at about five or six millions aear and when i came to mention the issues he found they sometimes amounted to more than double for the notes he had taken were very particular in this point because he hoped as he told me that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him and he could not be deceived in his calculations but if what i told him were true he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a private person he asked me who were our creditors and where we found money to pay them he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive wars that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people or live among very bad neighbours and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings he asked what business we had out of our own islands unless upon the score of trade or treaty or to defend the coasts with our fleet above all he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing army in the midst of peace and among a free people he said if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our representatives he could not imagine of whom we were afraid or against whom we were to fight and would hear my opinion whether a private man s house might not be better defended by himself his children and family than by halfozen rascals picked up at a venture in the streets for small wages who might get a hundred times more by cutting their throats he laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic as he was pleased to call it in reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from the several sects among us in religion and politics he said he knew no reason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public should be obliged to change or should not be obliged to conceal them and as it was tyranny in any government to require the first so it was weakness not to enforce the second for a man may be allowed to keep poisons in his closet but not to vend them about for cordials he observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry i had mentioned gaming he desired to know at what age this entertainment was usually taken up and when it was laid down how much of their time it employed whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes whether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might not arrive at great riches and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence as well as habituate them to vile companions wholly take them from the improvement of their minds and force them by the losses they received to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon others he was perfectly astonished with the historical account gave him of our affairs during the last century protesting it was only a heap of conspiracies rebellions murders massacres revolutions banishments the very worst effects that avarice faction hypocrisy perfidiousness cruelty rage madness hatred envy lust malice and ambition could produce his majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the sum of all i had spoken compared the questions he made with the answers i had given then taking me into his hands and stroking me gently delivered himself in these words which i shall never forget nor the manner he spoke them in my little friend grildrig you have made a most admirable panegyric upon your country you have clearly proved that ignorance idleness and vice are the proper ingredients for qualifying a legislator that laws are best explained interpreted and applied by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting confounding and eluding them i observe among you some lines of an institution which in its original might have been tolerable but these half erased and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions it does not appear from all you have said how any one perfection is required toward the procurement of any one station among you much less that men are ennobled on account of their virtue that priests are advanced for their piety or learning soldiers for their conduct or valour judges for their integrity senators for the love of their country or counsellors for their wisdom as for yourself continued the king who have spent the greatest part of your life in travelling i am well disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country but by what i have gathered from your own relation and the answers i have with much pains wrung and extorted from you i cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth chapter the author s love of his country he makes a proposal of much advantage to the king which is rejected the king s great ignorance in politics the learning of that country very imperfect and confined the laws and military affairs and parties in the state nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from concealing this part of my story it was in vain to discover my resentments which were always turned into ridicule and i was forced to rest with patience while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously treated i am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be that such an occasion was given but this prince happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him what satisfaction i was able yet thus much i may be allowed to say in my own vindication that i artfully eluded many of his questions and gave to every point a more favourable turn by many degrees than the strictness of truth would allow for i have always borne that laudable partiality to my own country which dionysius halicarnassensis with so much justice recommends to an historian i would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother and place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light this was my sincere endeavour in those many discourses i had with that monarch although it unfortunately failed of success but great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly secluded from the rest of the world and must therefore be altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices and a certain narrowness of thinking from which we and the politer countries of europe are wholly exempted and it would be hard indeed if so remote a prince s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for all mankind to confirm what i have now said and further to show the miserable effects of a confined education i shall here insert a passage which will hardly obtain belief in hopes to ingratiate myself further into his majesty s favour i told him of an invention discovered between three and four hundred years ago to make a certain powder into a heap of which the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in a moment although it were as big as a mountain and make it all fly up in the air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder that a proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or iron according to its bigness would drive a ball of iron or lead with such violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force that the largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once but batter the strongest walls to the ground sink down ships with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea and when linked together by a chain would cut through masts and rigging divide hundreds of bodies in the middle and lay all waste before them that we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron and discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging which would rip up the pavements tear the houses to pieces burst and throw splinters on every side dashing out the brains of all who came near that i knew the ingredients very well which were cheap and common i understood the manner of compounding them and could direct his workmen how to make those tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in his majesty s kingdom and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long twenty or thirty of which tubes charged with the proper quantity of powder and balls would batter down the walls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours or destroy the whole metropolis if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands this i humbly offered to his majesty as a small tribute of acknowledgment in turn for so many marks that i had received of his royal favour and protection the king was struck with horror at the description i had given of those terrible engines and the proposal i had made he was amazed how so impotent and grovelling an insect as i these were his expression could entertain such inhuman ideas and in so familiar a manner as to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which i had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines whereof he said some evil genius enemy to mankind must have been the first contriver as for himself he protested that although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature yet he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secret which he commanded me as i valued any life never to mention any more a strange effect of narrow principles and views that a prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration love and esteem of strong parts great wisdom and profound learning endowed with admirable talents and almost adored by his subjects should from a nice unnecessary scruple whereof in europe we can have no conception let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives the liberties and the fortunes of his people neither do i say this with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that excellent king whose character i am sensible will on this account be very much lessened in the opinion of an english reader but i take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance by not having hitherto reduced politics into a science as the more acute wits of europe have done for i remember very well in a discourse one day with the king when i happened to say there were several thousand books among us written upon the art of government it gave him directly contrary to my intentio a very mean opinion of our understandings he professed both to abominate and despise all mystery refinement and intrigue either in a prince or a minister he could not tell what i meant by secrets of state where an enemy or some rival nation were not in the case he confined the knowledge of governing within very narrow bounds to common sense and reason to justice and lenity to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes with some other obvious topics which are not worth considering and he gave it for his opinion that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together the learning of this people is very defective consisting only in morality history poetry and mathematics wherein they must be allowed to excel but the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in life to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts so that among us it would be little esteemed and as to ideas entities abstractions and transcendentals i could never drive the least conception into their heads no law in that country must exceed in words the number of letters in their alphabet which consists only of two and twenty but indeed few of them extend even to that length they are expressed in the most plain and simple terms wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover above one interpretation and to write a comment upon any law is a capital crime as to the decision of civil causes or proceedings against criminals their precedents are so few that they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either they have had the art of printing as well as the chinese time out of mind but their libraries are not very large for that of the king which is reckoned the largest does not amount to above a thousand volumes placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long whence i had liberty to borrow what books i pleased the queen s joiner had contrived in one of glumdalclitch s rooms a kind of wooden machine fivendwenty feet high formed like a standing ladder the steps were each fifty feet long it was indeed a moveable pair of stairs the lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber the book i had a mind to read was put up leaning against the wall i first mounted to the upper step of the ladder and turning my face towards the book began at the top of the page and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten paces according to the length of the lines till i had gotten a little below the level of mine eyes and then descending gradually till i came to the bottom after which i mounted again and began the other page in the same manner and so turned over the leaf which i could easily do with both my hands for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard and in the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long their style is clear masculine and smooth but not florid for they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words or using various expressions i have perused many of their books especially those in history and morality among the rest i was much diverted with a little old treatise which always lay in glumdalclitch s bed chamber and belonged to her governess a grave elderly gentlewoman who dealt in writings of morality and devotion the book treats of the weakness of human kind and is in little esteem except among the women and the vulgar however i was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such a subject this writer went through all the usual topics of european moralists showing how diminutive contemptible and helpless an animal was man in his own nature how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air or the fury of wild beasts how much he was excelled by one creature in strength by another in speed by a third in foresight by a fourth in industry he added that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world and could now produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancient times he said it was very reasonable to think not only that the species of men were originally much larger but also that there must have been giants in former ages which as it is asserted by history and tradition so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom far exceeding the common dwindled race of men in our days he argued that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made in the beginning of a size more large and robust not so liable to destruction from every little accident of a tile falling from a house or a stone cast from the hand of a boy or being drowned in a little brook from this way of reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the conduct of life but needless here to repeat for my own part i could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread of drawing lectures in morality or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining from the quarrels we raise with nature and i believe upon a strict inquiry those quarrels might be shown as illrounded among us as they are among that people as to their military affairs they boast that the king s army consists of a hundred and seventyix thousand foot and thirtywo thousand horse if that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in the several cities and farmers in the country whose commanders are only the nobility and gentry without pay or reward they are indeed perfect enough in their exercises and under very good discipline wherein i saw no great merit for how should it be otherwise where every farmer is under the command of his own landlord and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own city chosen after the manner of venice by ballot i have often seen the militia of lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in a great field near the city of twenty miles square they were in all not above twentyive thousand foot and six thousand horse but it was impossible for me to compute their number considering the space of ground they took up a cavalier mounted on a large steed might be about ninety feet high i have seen this whole body of horse upon a word of command draw their swords at once and brandish them in the air imagination can figure nothing so grand so surprising and so astonishing it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky i was curious to know how this prince to whose dominions there is no access from any other country came to think of armies or to teach his people the practice of military discipline but i was soon informed both by conversation and reading their histories for in the course of many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which the whole race of mankind is subject the nobility often contending for power the people for liberty and the king for absolute dominion all which however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom have been sometimes violated by each of the three parties and have more than once occasioned civil wars the last whereof was happily put an end to by this prince s grandather in a general composition and the militia then settled with common consent has been ever since kept in the strictest duty chapter the king and queen make a progress to the frontiers the author attends them the manner in which he leaves the country very particularly related he returns to england i had always a strong impulse that i should some time recover my liberty though it was impossible to conjecture by what means or to form any project with the least hope of succeeding the ship in which i sailed was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast and the king had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared it should be taken ashore and with all its crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to lorbrulgrud he was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own size by whom i might propagate the breed but i think i should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages like tame canaryirds and perhaps in time sold about the kingdom to persons of quality for curiosities i was indeed treated with much kindness i was the favourite of a great king and queen and the delight of the whole court but it was upon such a foot as ill became the dignity of humankind i could never forget those domestic pledges i had left behind me i wanted to be among people with whom i could converse upon even terms and walk about the streets and fields without being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy but my deliverance came sooner than i expected and in a manner not very common the whole story and circumstances of which i shall faithfully relate i had now been two years in this country and about the beginning of the third glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen in a progress to the south coast of the kingdom i was carried as usual in my travellingox which as i have already described was a very convenient closet of twelve feet wide and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed by silken ropes from the four corners at the top to break the jolts when a servant carried me before him on horseback as i sometimes desired and would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road on the roof of my closet not directly over the middle of the hammock i ordered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square to give me air in hot weather as i slept which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drew backward and forward through a groove when we came to our journey s end the king thought proper to pass a few days at a palace he has near flanflasnic a city within eighteen english miles of the seaside glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued i had gotten a small cold but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to her chamber i longed to see the ocean which must be the only scene of my escape if ever it should happen i pretended to be worse than i really was and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with a page whom i was very fond of and who had sometimes been trusted with me i shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitch consented nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me bursting at the same time into a flood of tears as if she had some forboding of what was to happen the boy took me out in my box about half an hours walk from the palace towards the rocks on the seahore i ordered him to set me down and lifting up one of my sashes cast many a wistful melancholy look towards the sea i found myself not very well and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock which i hoped would do me good i got in and the boy shut the window close down to keep out the cold i soon fell asleep and all i can conjecture is while i slept the page thinking no danger could happen went among the rocks to look for birds eggs having before observed him from my window searching about and picking up one or two in the clefts be that as it will i found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage i felt my box raised very high in the air and then borne forward with prodigious speed the first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock but afterward the motion was easy enough i called out several times as loud as i could raise my voice but all to no purpose i looked towards my windows and could see nothing but the clouds and sky i heard a noise just over my head like the clapping of wings and then began to perceive the woful condition i was in that some eagle had got the ring of my box in his beak with an intent to let it fall on a rock like a tortoise in a shell and then pick out my body and devour it for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance though better concealed than i could be within a twonch board in a little time i observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase very fast and my box was tossed up and down like a sign in a windy day i heard several bangs or buffets as i thought given to the eagle for such i am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his bea and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly down for above a minute but with such incredible swiftness that i almost lost my breath my fall was stopped by a terrible squash that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of niagara after which i was quite in the dark for another minute and then my box began to rise so high that i could see light from the tops of the windows i now perceived i was fallen into the sea my box by the weight of my body the goods that were in and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four corners of the top and bottom floated about five feet deep in water i did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three others and forced to let me drop while he defended himself against the rest who hoped to share in the prey the plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box for those were the stronges preserved the balance while it fell and hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water every joint of it was well grooved and the door did not move on hinges but up and down like a sash which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in i got with much difficulty out of my hammock having first ventured to draw back the slipoard on the roof already mentioned contrived on purpose to let in air for want of which i found myself almost stifled how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch from whom one single hour had so far divided me and i may say with truth that in the midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear lamenting my poor nurse the grief she would suffer for my loss the displeasure of the queen and the ruin of her fortune perhaps many travellers have not been under greater difficulties and distress than i was at this juncture expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces or at least overset by the first violent blast or rising wave a breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate death nor could any thing have preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside against accidents in travelling i saw the water in at several crannies although the leaks were not considerable and i endeavoured to stop them as well as i could i was not able to lift up the roof of my closet which otherwise i certainly should have done and sat on the top of it where i might at least preserve myself some hours longer than by being shut up as i may call i in the hold or if i escaped these dangers for a day or two what could i expect but a miserable death of cold and hunger i was four hours under these circumstances expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my last i have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window and into which the servant who used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt and buckle it about his waist being in this disconsolate state i heard or at least thought i heard some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed and soon after i began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea for i now and then felt a sort of tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows leaving me almost in the dark this gave me some faint hopes of relief although i was not able to imagine how it could be brought about i ventured to unscrew one of my chairs which were always fastened to the floor and having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly under the slippingoard that i had lately opened i mounted on the chair and putting my mouth as near as i could to the hole i called for help in a loud voice and in all the languages i understood i then fastened my handkerchief to a stick i usually carried and thrusting it up the hole waved it several times in the air that if any boat or ship were near the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box i found no effect from all i could do but plainly perceived my closet to be moved along and in the space of an hour or better that side of the box where the staples were and had no windows struck against something that was hard i apprehended it to be a rock and found myself tossed more than ever i plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet like that of a cable and the grating of it as it passed through the ring i then found myself hoisted up by degrees at least three feet higher than i was before whereupon i again thrust up my stick and handkerchief calling for help till i was almost hoarse in return to which i heard a great shout repeated three times giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them i now heard a trampling over my head and somebody calling through the hole with a loud voice in the english tongue if there be any body below let them speak i answered i was an englishman drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent and begged by all that was moving to be delivered out of the dungeon i was in the voice replied i was safe for my box was fastened to their ship and the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover large enough to pull me out i answered that was needless and would take up too much time for there was no more to be done but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring and take the box out of the sea into the ship and so into the captain s cabin some of them upon hearing me talk so wildly thought i was mad others laughed for indeed it never came into my head that i was now got among people of my own stature and strength the carpenter came and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet square then let down a small ladder upon which i mounted and thence was taken into the ship in a very weak condition the sailors were all in amazement and asked me a thousand questions which i had no inclination to answer i was equally confounded at the sight of so many pigmies for such i took them to be after having so long accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects i had left but the captain mr thomas wilcocks an honest worthy shropshire man observing i was ready to faint took me into his cabin gave me a cordial to comfort me and made me turn in upon his own bed advising me to take a little rest of which i had great need before i went to sleep i gave him to understand that i had some valuable furniture in my box too good to be lost a fine hammock a handsome fielded two chairs a table and a cabinet that my closet was hung on all sides or rather quilted with silk and cotton that if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin i would open it there before him and show him my goods the captain hearing me utter these absurdities concluded i was raving however i suppose to pacify he promised to give order as i desired and going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closet whence as i afterwards foun they drew up all my goods and stripped off the quilting but the chairs cabinet and bedstead being screwed to the floor were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen who tore them up by force then they knocked off some of the boards for the use of the ship and when they had got all they had a mind for let the hull drop into the sea which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom and sides sunk to rights and indeed i was glad not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made because i am confident it would have sensibly touched me by bringing former passages into my mind which i would rather have forgot i slept some hours but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place i had left and the dangers i had escaped however upon waking i found myself much recovered it was now about eight o clock at night and the captain ordered supper immediately thinking i had already fasted too long he entertained me with great kindness observing me not to look wildly or talk inconsistently and when we were left alone desired i would give him a relation of my travels and by what accident i came to be set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest he said that about twelve o clock at noon as he was looking through his glass he spied it at a distance and thought it was a sail which he had a mind to make being not much out of his course in hopes of buying some biscuit his own beginning to fall short that upon coming nearer and finding his error he sent out his longoat to discover what it was that his men came back in a fright swearing they had seen a swimming house that he laughed at their folly and went himself in the boat ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them that the weather being calm he rowed round me several times observed my windows and wire lattices that defended them that he discovered two staples upon one side which was all of boards without any passage for light he then commanded his men to row up to that side and fastening a cable to one of the staples ordered them to tow my chest as they called it toward the ship when it was there he gave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover and to raise up my chest with pulleys which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet he said they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity i asked whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air about the time he first discovered me to which he answered that discoursing this matter with the sailors while i was asleep one of them said he had observed three eagles flying towards the north but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size which i suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at and he could not guess the reason of my question i then asked the captain how far he reckoned we might be from land he said by the best computation he could make we were at least a hundred leagues i assured him that he must be mistaken by almost half for i had not left the country whence i came above two hours before i dropped into the sea whereupon he began again to think that my brain was disturbed of which he gave me a hint and advised me to go to bed in a cabin he had provided i assured him i was well refreshed with his good entertainment and company and as much in my senses as ever i was in my life he then grew serious and desired to ask me freely whether i were not troubled in my mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime for which i was punished at the command of some prince by exposing me in that chest as great criminals in other countries have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel without provisions for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship yet he would engage his word to set me safe ashore in the first port where we arrived he added that his suspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches i had delivered at first to his sailors and afterwards to himself in relation to my closet or chest as well as by my odd looks and behaviour while i was at supper i begged his patience to hear me tell my story which i faithfully did from the last time i left england to the moment he first discovered me and as truth always forces its way into rational minds so this honest worthy gentleman who had some tincture of learning and very good sense was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity but further to confirm all i had said i entreated him to give order that my cabinet should be brought of which i had the key in my pocket for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet i opened it in his own presence and showed him the small collection of rarities i made in the country from which i had been so strangely delivered there was the comb i had contrived out of the stumps of the king s beard and another of the same materials but fixed into a paring of her majesty s thumbail which served for the back there was a collection of needles and pins from a foot to half a yard long four wasp stings like joiner s tacks some combings of the queen s hair a gold ring which one day she made me a present of in a most obliging manner taking it from her little finger and throwing it over my head like a collar i desired the captain would please to accept this ring in return for his civilities which he absolutely refused i showed him a corn that i had cut off with my own hand from a maid of honour s toe it was about the bigness of kentish pippin and grown so hard that when i returned england i got it hollowed into a cup and set in silver lastly i desired him to see the breeches i had then on which were made of a mouse s skin i could force nothing on him but a footman s tooth which i observed him to examine with great curiosity and found he had a fancy for it he received it with abundance of thanks more than such a trifle could deserve it was drawn by an unskilful surgeon in a mistake from one of glumdalclitch s men who was afflicted with the toothche but it was as sound as any in his head i got it cleaned and put it into my cabinet it was about a foot long and four inches in diameter the captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had given him and said he hoped when we returned to england i would oblige the world by putting it on paper and making it public my answer was that we were overstocked with books of travels that nothing could now pass which was not extraordinary wherein i doubted some authors less consulted truth than their own vanity or interest or the diversion of ignorant readers that my story could contain little beside common events without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants trees birds and other animals or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of savage people with which most writers abound however i thanked him for his good opinion and promised to take the matter into my thoughts he said he wondered at one thing very much which was to hear me speak so loud asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing i told him it was what i had been used to for above two years past and that i admired as much at the voices of him and his men who seemed to me only to whisper and yet i could hear them well enough but when i spoke in that country it was like a man talking in the streets to another looking out from the top of a steeple unless when i was placed on a table or held in any person s hand i told him i had likewise observed another thing that when i first got into the ship and the sailors stood all about me i thought they were the most little contemptible creatures i had ever beheld for indeed while i was in that prince s country i could never endure to look in a glass after mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects because the comparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself the captain said that while we were at supper he observed me to look at every thing with a sort of wonder and that i often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter which he knew not well how to take but imputed it to some disorder in my brain i answered it was very true and i wondered how i could forbear when i saw his dishes of the size of a silver threeence a leg of pork hardly a mouthful a cup not so big as a nuthell and so i went on describing the rest of his householdtuff and provisions after the same manner for although he queen had ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me while i was in her service yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what i saw on every side of me and i winked at my own littleness as people do at their own faults the captain understood my raillery very well and merrily replied with the old english proverb that he doubted mine eyes were bigger than my belly for he did not observe my stomach so good although i had fasted all day and continuing in his mirth protested he would have gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen my closet in the eagle s bill and afterwards in its fall from so great a height into the sea which would certainly have been a most astonishing object worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages and the comparison of pha ton was so obvious that he could not forbear applying it although i did not much admire the conceit the captain having been at tonquin was in his return to england driven northastward to the latitude of degrees and longitude of but meeting a tradeind two days after i came on board him we sailed southward a long time and coasting new holland kept our course westouthest and then southouthest till we doubled the cape of good hope our voyage was very prosperous but i shall not trouble the reader with a journal of it the captain called in at one or two ports and sent in his longoat for provisions and fresh water but i never went out of the ship till we came into the downs which was on the third day of june about nine months after my escape i offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight but the captain protested he would not receive one farthing we took a kind leave of each other and i made him promise he would come to see me at my house in redriff i hired a horse and guide for five shillings which i borrowed of the captain as i was on the road observing the littleness of the houses the trees the cattle and the people i began to think myself in lilliput i was afraid of trampling on every traveller i met and often called aloud to have them stand out of the way so that i had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence when i came to my own house for which i was forced to inquire one of the servants opening the door i bent down to go in like a goose under a gate for fear of striking my head my wife run out to embrace me but i stooped lower than her knees thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my mouth my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing but i could not see her till she arose having been so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet and then i went to take her up with one hand by the waist i looked down upon the servants and one or two friends who were in the house as if they had been pigmies and i a giant i told my wife she had been too thrifty for i found she had starved herself and her daughter to nothing in short i behaved myself so unaccountably that they were all of the captain s opinion when he first saw me and concluded i had lost my wits this i mention as an instance of the great power of habit and prejudice in a little time i and my family and friends came to a right understanding but my wife protested i should never go to sea any more although my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder me as the reader may know hereafter in the mean time i here conclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages part a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and japan chapter i the author sets out on his third voyage is taken by pirates the malice of a dutchman his arrival at an island he is received into laputa i had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson a cornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundred tons came to my house i had formerly been surgeon of another ship where he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levant he had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer and hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out of friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long absences but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find i me in good health asking whether i were now settled for life adding that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months at last he plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the ship that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two mates that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having experienced my knowledge in seaffairs to be at least equal to his he would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i had shared in the command he said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest a man that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeing the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as ever the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose consent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she proposed to her children we set out the th day of august and arrived at fort st george the th of april we staid there three weeks to refresh our crew many of whom were sick from thence we went to tonquin where the captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in several months therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands and putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he transacted his affairs at tonquin we had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we were driven five days to the northorthast and then to the east after which we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from the west upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon overtook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slow neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our faces for so i gave orde they pinioned us with strong ropes and setting guard upon us went to search the sloop i observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authority though he was not commander of either ship he knew us by our countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea i spoke dutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him in consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take some pity on us this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese language as i suppose often using the word christianos the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly he came up to me and after several questions which i answered in great humility he said we should not die i made the captain a very low bow and then turning to the dutchman said i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in a brother christian but i had soon reason to repent those foolish words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea which they would not yield to after the promise made me that i should not however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me worse in all human appearance than death itself my men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned as to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a small canoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which last the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and would permit no man to search me i got down into the canoe while the dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could afford about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation and found we were in the latitude of n and longitude of when i was at some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocketlass several islands to the southast i set up my sail the wind being fair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made a shift to do in about three hours it was all rocky however i got many birds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry seaeed by which i roasted my eggs i ate no other supper being resolved to spare my provisions as much as i could i passed the night under the shelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty well the next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third and fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles but not to trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let it suffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sight which lay southouthast to the former this island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did not reach it in less than five hours i encompassed it almost round before i could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creek about three times the wideness of my canoe i found the island to be all rocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweetmelling herbs i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself i secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers i gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dry seaeed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day and roast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel match and burninglass i lay all night in the cave where i had lodged my provisions my bed was the same dry grass and seaeed which i intended for fuel i slept very little for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake i considered how impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and how miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding that i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced i walked awhile among the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i was forced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscure as i thought in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud i turned back and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but i did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than if i had stood under the shade of a mountain as it approached nearer over the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance the bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the sea below i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at less than an english mile distance i took out my pocket perspective and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of it which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i was not able to distinguish the natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or other help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in but at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as it should see to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they pleased but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the island would take because it seemed for awhile to stand still yet soon after it advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to descend from one to the other in the lowest gallery i beheld some people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on i waved my cap for my hat was long since worn ou and my handkerchief toward the island and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view i found by their pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me although they made no return to my shouting but i could see four or five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island who then disappeared i happened rightly to conjecture that these were sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion the number of people increased and in less than half an hour the island was moved and raised in such a manner that the lowest gallery appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the height where i stood i then put myself in the most supplicating posture and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer those who stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinction as i supposed by their habit they conferred earnestly with each other looking often upon me at length one of them called out in a clear polite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and therefore i returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadence might be more agreeable to his ears although neither of us understood the other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw the distress i was in they made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the shore which i accordingly did and the flying island being raised to a convenient height the verge directly over me a chain was let down from the lowest gallery with a seat fastened to the bottom to which i fixed myself and was drawn up by pulleys chapter the humours and dispositions of the laputians described an account of their learning of the king and his court the author s reception there the inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes an account of the women at my alighting i was surrounded with a crowd of people but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better quality they beheld me with all the marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was i much in their debt having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their shapes habits and countenances their heads were all reclined either to the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the other directly up to the zenith their outward garments were adorned with the figures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddles flutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many other instruments of music unknown to us in europe i observed here and there many in the habit of servants with a blown bladder fastened like a flail to the end of a stick which they carried in their hands in each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas or little pebbles as i was afterwards informed with these bladders they now and then flapped the mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice i could not then conceive the meaning it seems the minds of these people are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speak nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by some external action upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reason those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper the original is climenol in their family as one of their domestics nor ever walk abroad or make visits without him and the business of this officer is when two three or more persons are in company gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself this flapper is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks and upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and in the streets of justling others or being justled himself into the kennel it was necessary to give the reader this information without which he would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these people as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island and from thence to the royal palace while we were ascending they forgot several times what they were about and left me to myself till their memories were again roused by their flappers for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance and by the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged at last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber of presence where i saw the king seated on his throne attended on each side by persons of prime quality before the throne was a large table filled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of all kinds his majesty took not the least notice of us although our entrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court but he was then deep in a problem and we attended at least an hour before he could solve it there stood by him on each side a young page with flaps in their hands and when they saw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the other his right ear at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden and looking towards me and the company i was in recollected the occasion of our coming whereof he had been informed before he spoke some words whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side and flapped me gently on the right ear but i made signs as well as i could that i had no occasion for such an instrument which as i afterwards found gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of my understanding the king as far as i could conjecture asked me several questions and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i had when it was found i could neither understand nor be understood i was conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace this prince being distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to stranger where two servants were appointed to attend me my dinner was brought and four persons of quality whom i remembered to have seen very near the king s person did me the honour to dine with me we had two courses of three dishes each in the first course there was a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle a piece of beef into a rhomboides and a pudding into a cycloid the second course was two ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp the servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several other mathematical figures while we were at dinner i made bold to ask the names of several things in their language and those noble persons by the assistance of their flappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them i was soon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else i wanted after dinner my company withdrew and a person was sent to me by the king s order attended by a flapper he brought with him pen ink and paper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that he was sent to teach me the language we sat together four hours in which time i wrote down a great number of words in columns with the translations over against them i likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch something to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walk and the like then i took down the sentence in writing he showed me also in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars the zodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominations of many plains and solids he gave me the names and descriptions of all the musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on each of them after he had left me i placed all my words with their interpretations in alphabetical order and thus in a few days by the help of a very faithful memory i got some insight into their language the word which i interpret the flying or floating island is in the original laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymology lap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh a governor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa from lapuntuh but i do not approve of this derivation which seems to be a little strained i ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lap signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outed a wing which however i shall not obtrude but submit to the judicious reader those to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill i was clad ordered a tailor to come next morning and take measure for a suit of clothes this operator did his office after a different manner from those of his trade in europe he first took my altitude by a quadrant and then with a rule and compasses described the dimensions and outlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in six days brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape by happening to mistake a figure in the calculation but my comfort was that i observed such accidents very frequent and little regarded during my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition that held me some days longer i much enlarged my dictionary and when i went next to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and to return him some kind of answers his majesty had given orders that the island should move northast and by east to the vertical point over lagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth it was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days and a half i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made in the air by the island on the second morning about eleven o clock the king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers and officers having prepared all their musical instruments played on them for three hours without intermission so that i was quite stunned with the noise neither could i possibly guess the meaning till my tutor informed me he said that the people of their island had their ears adapted to hear the music of the spheres which always played at certain periods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever instrument they most excelled in our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered that the island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence he might receive the petitions of his subjects and to this purpose several packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom on these packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted up directly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of the string that holds their kite sometimes we received wine and victuals from below which were drawn up by pulleys the knowledge i had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring their phraseology which depended much upon that science and music and in the latter i was not unskilled their ideas are perpetually conversant in lines and figures if they would for example praise the beauty of a woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombs circles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or by words of art drawn from music needless here to repeat i observed in the king s kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his majesty s table their houses are very ill built the walls bevil without one right angle in any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to practical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic those instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their workmen which occasions perpetual mistakes and although they are dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rule the pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behaviour of life i have not seen a more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects except those of mathematics and music they are very bad reasoners and vehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of the right opinion which is seldom their case imagination fancy and invention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in their language by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass of their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences most of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical part have great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own it publicly but what i chiefly admired and thought altogether unaccountable was the strong disposition i observed in them towards news and politics perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving their judgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion i have indeed observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians i have known in europe although i could never discover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those people suppose that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the largest therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe but i rather take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have least concern and for which we are least adapted by study or nature these people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minute s peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the tail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes and that the next which they have calculated for onendhirty years hence will probably destroy us for if in its perihelion it should approach within a certain degree of the sun as by their calculations they have reason to drea it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light from it they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of life when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question is about the sun s health how he looked at his setting and rising and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet this conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for fear the women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn their husbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is always a considerable number from the continent below attending at court either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their own particular occasions but are much despised because they want the same endowments among these the ladies choose their gallants but the vexation is that they act with too much ease and security for the husband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be but provided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his side the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island although i think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and although they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowed to do whatever they please they long to see the world and take the diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without a particular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtained because the people of quality have found by frequent experience how hard it is to persuade their women to return from below i was told that a great court lady who had several children is married to the prime minister the richest subject in the kingdom a very graceful person extremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the island went down to lagado on the pretence of health there hid herself for several months till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she was found in an obscure eatingouse all in rags having pawned her clothes to maintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whose company she was taken much against her will and although her husband received her with all possible kindness and without the least reproach she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to the same gallant and has not been heard of since this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english story than for one of a country so remote but he may please to consider that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate or nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easily imagined in about a month s time i had made a tolerable proficiency in their language and was able to answer most of the king s questions when i had the honour to attend him his majesty discovered not the least curiosity to inquire into the laws government history religion or manners of the countries where i had been but confined his questions to the state of mathematics and received the account i gave him with great contempt and indifference though often roused by his flapper on each side chapter a phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy the laputians great improvements in the latter the king s method of suppressing insurrections i desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attend me i chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it owed its several motions whereof i will now give a philosophical account to the reader the flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter yards or about four miles and a half and consequently contains ten thousand acres it is three hundred yards thick the bottom or under surface which appears to those who view it below is one even regular plate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards above it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is a coat of rich mould ten or twelve feet deep the declivity of the upper surface from the circumference to the centre is the natural cause why all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four large basins each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundred yards distant from the centre from these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents their overflowing besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the island above the region of clouds and vapours he can prevent the falling of dews and rain whenever he pleases for the highest clouds cannot rise above two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known to do so in that country at the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in diameter whence the astronomers descend into a large dome which is therefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomer s cave situated at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant in this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from the reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part the place is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopes astrolabes and other astronomical instruments but the greatest curiosity upon which the fate of the island depends is a loadstone of a prodigious size in shape resembling a weaver s shuttle it is in length six yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over this magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its middle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it it is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant four feet yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eight adamantine feet each six yards high in the middle of the concave side there is a groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of the axle are lodged and turned round as there is occasion the stone cannot be removed from its place by any force because the hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which constitutes the bottom of the island by means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and move from one place to another for with respect to that part of the earth over which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sides with an attractive power and at the other with a repulsive upon placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth the island descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards the island mounts directly upwards when the position of the stone is oblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction by this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the monarch s dominions to explain the manner of its progress let a b represent a line drawn across the dominions of balnibarbi let the line represent the loadstone of which let be the repelling end and the attracting end the island being over let the stone be placed in position with its repelling end downwards then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards when it is arrived at let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end points towards e and then the island will be carried obliquely towards e where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in the position e f with its repelling point downwards the island will rise obliquely towards f where by directing the attracting end towards g the island may be carried to g and from g to h by turning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward and thus by changing the situation of the stone as often as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings the obliquity being not considerabl is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other but it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the extent of the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four miles for which the astronomers who have written large systems concerning the ston assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about six leagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globe but terminated with the limits of the king s dominions and it was easy from the great advantage of such a superior situation for a prince to bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island stands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equal distance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawing downwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion can ensue this loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from time to time give it such positions as the monarch directs they spend the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies which they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness for although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet they magnify much more than those of a hundred with us and show the stars with greater clearness this advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much further than our astronomers in europe for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one third part of that number they have likewise discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about mars whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the former revolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twentyne and a half so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of mars which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies they have observed ninetyhree different comets and settled their periods with great exactness if this be true and they affirm it with great confidenc it is much to be wished that their observations were made public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lame and defective might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of astronomy the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he could but prevail on a ministry to join with him but these having their estates below on the continent and considering that the office of a favourite has a very uncertain tenure would never consent to the enslaving of their country if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violent factions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods of reducing them to obedience the first and the mildest course is by keeping the island hovering over such a town and the lands about it whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if the crime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with great stones against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars or caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces but if they still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections he proceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upon their heads which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men however this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare his ministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odious to the people so it would be a great damage to their own estates which all lie below for the island is the king s demesne but there is still indeed a more weighty reason why the kings of this country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action unless upon the utmost necessity for if the town intended to be destroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out in the larger cities a situation probably chosen at first with a view to prevent such a catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars of stone a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the island which although it consist as i have said of one entire adamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great a shock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below as the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys of all this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carry their obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned and the king when he is highest provoked and most determined to press a city to rubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of a pretence of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breaking the adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and the whole mass would fall to the ground by a fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of his two eldest sons are permitted to leave the island nor the queen till she is past childearing chapter the author leaves laputa is conveyed to balnibarbi arrives at the metropolis a description of the metropolis and the country adjoining the author hospitably received by a great lord his conversation with that lord although i cannot say that i was ill treated in this island yet i must confess i thought myself too much neglected not without some degree of contempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any part of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein i was far their inferior and upon that account very little regarded on the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island i was very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those people they were indeed excellent in two sciences for which i have great esteem and wherein i am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted and involved in speculation that i never met with such disagreeable companions i conversed only with women tradesmen flappers and courtages during two months of my abode there by which at last i rendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only people from whom i could ever receive a reasonable answer i had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in their language i was weary of being confined to an island where i received so little countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity there was a great lord at court nearly related to the king and for that reason alone used with respect he was universally reckoned the most ignorant and stupid person among them he had performed many eminent services for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adorned with integrity and honour but so ill an ear for music that his detractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrong place neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics he was pleased to show me many marks of favour often did me the honour of a visit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws and customs the manners and learning of the several countries where i had travelled he listened to me with great attention and made very wise observations on all i spoke he had two flappers attending him for state but never made use of them except at court and in visits of ceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alone together i entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his majesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleased to tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers very advantageous which however i refused with expressions of the highest acknowledgment on the th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court the king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds english and my protector his kinsman as much more together with a letter of recommendation to a friend of his in lagado the metropolis the island being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it i was let down from the lowest gallery in the same manner as i had been taken up the continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying island passes under the general name of balnibarbi and the metropolis as i said before is called lagado i felt some little satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground i walked to the city without any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficiently instructed to converse with them i soon found out the person s house to whom i was recommended presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the island and was received with much kindness this great lord whose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where i continued during my stay and was entertained in a most hospitable manner the next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the town which is about half the bigness of london but the houses very strangely built and most of them out of repair the people in the streets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally in rags we passed through one of the town gates and went about three miles into the country where i saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what they were about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass although the soil appeared to be excellent i could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances both in town and country and i made bold to desire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what could be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in the streets and the fields because i did not discover any good effects they produced but on the contrary i never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or a people whose countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want this lord munodi was a person of the first rank and had been some years governor of lagado but by a cabal of ministers was discharged for insufficiency however the king treated him with tenderness as a welleaning man but of a low contemptible understanding when i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made no further answer than by telling me that i had not been long enough among them to form a judgment and that the different nations of the world had different customs with other common topics to the same purpose but when we returned to his palace he asked me how i liked the building what absurdities i observed and what quarrel i had with the dress or looks of his domestics this he might safely do because every thing about him was magnificent regular and polite i answered that his excellency s prudence quality and fortune had exempted him from those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others he said if i would go with him to his countryouse about twenty miles distant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kind of conversation i told his excellency that i was entirely at his disposal and accordingly we set out next morning during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers in managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable for except in some very few places i could not discover one ear of corn or blade of grass but in three hours travelling the scene was wholly altered we came into a most beautiful country farmers houses at small distances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyards cornrounds and meadows neither do i remember to have seen a more delightful prospect his excellency observed my countenance to clear up he told me with a sigh that there his estate began and would continue the same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculed and despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very few such as were old and wilful and weak like himself we came at length to the house which was indeed a noble structure built according to the best rules of ancient architecture the fountains gardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exact judgment and taste i gave due praises to every thing i saw whereof his excellency took not the least notice till after supper when there being no third companion he told me with a very melancholy air that he doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country to rebuild them after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast others into such a form as modern usage required and give the same directions to all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride singularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase his majesty s displeasure that the admiration i appeared to be under would cease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars which probably i never heard of at court the people there being too much taken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed here below the sum of his discourse was to this effect that about forty years ago certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion and after five months continuance came back with a very little smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all arts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot to this end they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in lagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that there is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work of ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing all the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase a hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy proposals the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are yet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country lies miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or clothes by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and illill as enemies to art ignorant and ill commonealth s men preferring their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country his lordship added that he would not by any further particulars prevent the pleasure i should certainly take in viewing the grand academy whither he was resolved i should go he only desired me to observe a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three miles distant of which he gave me this account that he had a very convenient mill within half a mile of his house turned by a current from a large river and sufficient for his own family as well as a great number of his tenants that about seven years ago a club of those projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the side of that mountain on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut for a repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water and thereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending down a declivity would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose course is more upon a level he said that being then not very well with the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with the proposal and after employing a hundred men for two years the work miscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon him railing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experiment with equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointment in a few days we came back to town and his excellency considering the bad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself but recommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither my lord was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects and a person of much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truth for i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days chapter the author permitted to see the grand academy of lagado the academy largely described the arts wherein the professors employ themselves this academy is not an entire single building but a continuation of several houses on both sides of a street which growing waste was purchased and applied to that use i was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to the academy every room has in it one or more projectors and i believe i could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms the first man i saw was of a meagre aspect with sooty hands and face his hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places his clothes shirt and skin were all of the same colour he has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in raw inclement summers he told me he did not doubt that in eight years more he should be able to supply the governor s gardens with sunshine at a reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers i made him a small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them i went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almost overcome with a horrible stink my conductor pressed me forward conjuring me in a whisper to give no offence which would be highly resented and therefore i durst not so much as stop my nose the projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy his face and beard were of a pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed over with filth when i was presented to him he gave me a close embrace a compliment i could well have excused his employment from his first coming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement to its original food by separating the several parts removing the tincture which it receives from the gall making the odour exhale and scumming off the saliva he had a weekly allowance from the society of a vessel filled with human ordure about the bigness of a bristol barrel i saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire which he intended to publish there was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method for building houses by beginning at the roof and working downward to the foundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those two prudent insects the bee and the spider there was a man born blind who had several apprentices in his own condition their employment was to colours for painters which their master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling it was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their lessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity in another apartment i was highly pleased with a projector who had found a device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges of ploughs cattle and labour the method is this in an acre of ground you bury at six inches distance and eight deep a quantity of acorns dates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are fondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field where in a few days they will root up the whole ground in search of their food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it with their dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge and trouble very great and they had little or no crop however it is not doubted that this invention may be capable of great improvement i went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round with cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out at my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs he lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using silkworms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the former because they understood how to weave as well as spin and he proposed further that by employing spiders the charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof i was fully convinced when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take a tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit everybody s fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength and consistence to the threads there was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sunial upon the great weathercock on the townouse by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings of the wind i was complaining of a small fit of the colic upon which my conductor led me into a room where a great physician resided who was famous for curing that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument he had a large pair of bellows with a long slender muzzle of ivory this he conveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmed he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder but when the disease was more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellows were full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient then withdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb strongly against the orifice of then fundament and this being repeated three or four times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxious along with it like water put into a pum and the patient recovered i saw him try both experiments upon a dog but could not discern any effect from the former after the latter the animal was ready to burst and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my companion the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavouring to recover him by the same operation i visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with all the curiosities i observed being studious of brevity i had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other being appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of whom i shall say something when i have mentioned one illustrious person more who is called among them the universal artist he told us he had been thirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life he had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at work some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance by extracting the nitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate others softening marble for pillows and pinushions others petrifying the hoofs of a living horse to preserve them from foundering the artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sow land with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained as he demonstrated by several experiments which i was not skilful enough to comprehend the other was by a certain composition of gums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom we crossed a walk to the other part of the academy where as i have already said the projectors in speculative learning resided the first professor i saw was in a very large room with forty pupils about him after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon a frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the room he said perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical operations but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and he flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang in any other man s head every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most ignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labour might write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics and theology without the least assistance from genius or study he then led me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in ranks it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room the superfices was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of a die but some larger than others they were all linked together by slender wires these bits of wood were covered on every square with paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but without any order the professor then desired me to observe for he was going to set his engine at work the pupils at his command took each of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed he then commanded sixndhirty of the lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the frame and where they found three or four words together that might make part of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were scribes this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places as the square bits of wood moved upside down six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected of broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those rich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts and sciences which however might be still improved and much expedited if the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such frames in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common their several collections he assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and made the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts of speech i made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for his great communicativeness and promised if ever i had the good fortune to return to my native country that i would do him justice as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine the form and contrivance of which i desired leave to delineate on paper as in the figure here annexed i told him although it were the custom of our learned in europe to steal inventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage that it became a controversy which was the right owner yet i would take such caution that he should have the honour entire without a rival we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in consultation upon improving that of their own country the first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all things imaginable are but norms the other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health as well as brevity for it is plain that every word we speak is in some degree a diminution of our lungs by corrosion and consequently contributes to the shortening of our lives an expedient was therefore offered that since words are only names for things it would be more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express a particular business they are to discourse on and this invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well as health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of their forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people however many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only this inconvenience attending it that if a man s business be very great and of various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater bundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him i have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when they met in the street would lay down their loads open their sacks and hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave but for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pockets and under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he cannot be at a loss therefore the room where company meet who practise this art is full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would serve as a universal language to be understood in all civilised nations whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended and thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes or ministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangers i was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupils after a method scarce imaginable to us in europe the proposition and demonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer with ink composed of a cephalic tincture this the student was to swallow upon a fasting stomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water as the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing the proposition along with it but the success has not hitherto been answerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition and partly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus is so nauseous that they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it can operate neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an abstinence as the prescription requires chapter a further account of the academy the author proposes some improvements which are honourably received in the school of political projectors i was but ill entertained the professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses which is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy these unhappy people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon the score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers to consult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminent services of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing it on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing for employments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wild impossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man to conceive and confirmed in me the old observation that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have not maintained for truth but however i shall so far do justice to this part of the academy as to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary there was a most ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature and system of government this illustrious person had very usefully employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are subject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey for instance whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political body can there be any thing more evident than that the health of both must be preserved and the diseases cured by the same prescriptions it is allowed that senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullient and other peccant humours with many diseases of the head and more of the heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleen flatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumours full of fetid purulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites and crudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention this doctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of the senate certain physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting and at the close of each day s debate feel the pulses of every senator after which having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth day return to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored with proper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of them lenitives aperitives abstersives corrosives restringents palliatives laxatives cephalalgics icterics apophlegmatics acoustics as their several cases required and according as these medicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the next meeting this project could not be of any great expense to the public and might in my poor opinion be of much use for the despatch of business in those countries where senates have any share in the legislative power beget unanimity shorten debates open a few mouths which are now closed and close many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young and correct the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pert again because it is a general complaint that the favourites of princes are troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposed that whoever attended a first minister after having told his business with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at his departure give the said minister a tweak by the nose or a kick in the belly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or run a pin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to prevent forgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation till the business were done or absolutely refused he likewise directed that every senator in the great council of a nation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defence of it should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if that were done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public when parties in a state are violent he offered a wonderful contrivance to reconcile them the method is this you take a hundred leaders of each party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of a size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at the same time in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided let the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to the head of his opposite partyan it seems indeed to be a work that requires some exactness but the professor assured us that if it were dexterously performed the cure would be infallible for he argued thus that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between themselves within the space of one skull would soon come to a good understanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity of thinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imagine they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as to the difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who are directors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge that it was a perfect trifle i heard a very warm debate between two professors about the most commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without grieving the subject the first affirmed the justest method would be to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon every man to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighbours the second was of an opinion directly contrary to tax those qualities of body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to be more or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own breast the highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex and the assessments according to the number and nature of the favours they have received for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers wit valour and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed and collected in the same manner by every person s giving his own word for the quantum of what he possessed but as to honour justice wisdom and learning they should not be taxed at all because they are qualifications of so singular a kind that no man will either allow them in his neighbour or value them in himself the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill in dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to be determined by their own judgment but constancy chastity good sense and good nature were not rated because they would not bear the charge of collecting to keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that the members should raffle for employment every man first taking an oath and giving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or not after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling upon the next vacancy thus hope and expectation would be kept alive none would complain of broken promises but impute their disappointments wholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a ministry another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government he advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times of eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wipe their posteriors take a strict view of their excrements and from the colour the odour the taste the consistence the crudeness or maturity of digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and designs because men are never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stool which he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when he used merely as a trial to consider which was the best way of murdering the king his ordure would have a tincture of green but quite different when he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the metropolis the whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing many observations both curious and useful for politicians but as i conceived not altogether complete this i ventured to tell the author and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions he received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers especially those of the projecting species professing he would be glad to receive further information i told him that in the kingdom of tribnia by the natives called langdon where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the colours the conduct and the pay of ministers of state and their deputies the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound politicians to restore new vigour to a crazy administration to stifle or divert general discontents to fill their coffers with forfeitures and raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall best answer their private advantage it is first agreed and settled among them what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot then effectual care is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the owners in chains these papers are delivered to a set of artists very dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables and letters for instance they can discover a close stool to signify a privy council a flock of geese a senate a lame dog an invader the plague a standing army a buzzard a prime minister the gout a high priest a gibbet a secretary of state a chamber pot a committee of grandees a sieve a court lady a broom a revolution a mouserap an employment a bottomless pit a treasury a sink a court a cap and bells a favourite a broken reed a court of justice an empty tun a general a running sore the administration when this method fails they have two others more effectual which the learned among them call acrostics and anagrams first they can decipher all initial letters into political meanings thus n shall signify a plot b a regiment of horse a fleet at sea or secondly by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they can lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party so for example if i should say in a letter to a friend our brother tom has just got the piles a skilful decipherer would discover that the same letters which compose that sentence may be analysed into the following words resist a plot is brought home the tour and this is the anagrammatic method the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these observations and promised to make honourable mention of me in his treatise i saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer continuance and began to think of returning home to england chapter the author leaves lagado arrives at maldonada no ship ready he takes a short voyage to glubbdubdrib his reception by the governor the continent of which this kingdom is apart extends itself as i have reason to believe eastward to that unknown tract of america westward of california and north to the pacific ocean which is not above a hundred and fifty miles from lagado where there is a good port and much commerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the northest about degrees north latitude and longitude this island of luggnagg stands southastward of japan about a hundred leagues distant there is a strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king of luggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other i determined therefore to direct my course this way in order to my return to europe i hired two mules with a guide to show me the way and carry my small baggage i took leave of my noble protector who had shown me so much favour and made me a generous present at my departure my journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating when i arrived at the port of maldonada for so it is calle there was no ship in the harbour bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time the town is about as large as portsmouth i soon fell into some acquaintance and was very hospitably received a gentleman of distinction said to me that since the ships bound for luggnagg could not be ready in less than a month it might be no disagreeable amusement for me to take a trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about five leagues off to the southest he offered himself and a friend to accompany me and that i should be provided with a small convenient bark for the voyage glubbdubdrib as nearly as i can interpret the word signifies the island of sorcerers or magicians it is about one third as large as the isle of wight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of a certain tribe who are all magicians this tribe marries only among each other and the eldest in succession is prince or governor he has a noble palace and a park of about three thousand acres surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty feet high in this park are several small enclosures for cattle corn and gardening the governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a kind somewhat unusual by his skill in necromancy he has a power of calling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service for twentyour hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons up again in less than three months except upon very extraordinary occasions when we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning one of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired admittance for a stranger who came on purpose to have the honour of attending on his highness this was immediately granted and we all three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armed and dressed after a very antic manner and with something in their countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express we passed through several apartments between servants of the same sort ranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presence where after three profound obeisances and a few general questions we were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his highness s throne he understood the language of balnibarbi although it was different from that of this island he desired me to give him some account of my travels and to let me see that i should be treated without ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his finger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instant like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden i could not recover myself in some time till the governor assured me that i should receive no hurt and observing my two companions to be under no concern who had been often entertained in the same manner i began to take courage and related to his highness a short history of my several adventures yet not without some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the place where i had seen those domestic spectres i had the honour to dine with the governor where a new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited at table i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in the morning i stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace my two friends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining which is the capital of this little island and the next morning we returned to pay our duty to the governor as he was pleased to command us after this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part of every day with the governor and at night in our lodging i soon grew so familiarized to the sight of spirits that after the third or fourth time they gave me no emotion at all or if i had any apprehensions left my curiosity prevailed over them for his highness the governor ordered me to call up whatever persons i would choose to name and in whatever numbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the present time and command them to answer any questions i should think fit to ask with this condition that my questions must be confined within the compass of the times they lived in and one thing i might depend upon that they would certainly tell me the truth for lying was a talent of no use in the lower world i made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour we were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into the park and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes of pomp and magnificence i desired to see alexander the great at the head of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon a motion of the governor s finger immediately appeared in a large field under the window where we stood alexander was called up into the room it was with great difficulty that i understood his greek and had but little of my own he assured me upon his honour that he was not poisoned but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking next i saw hannibal passing the alps who told me he had not a drop of vinegar in his camp i saw sar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engage i saw the former in his last great triumph i desired that the senate of rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly of somewhat a later age in counterview in another the first seemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods the other a knot of pedlars pickockets highwayman and bullies the governor at my request gave the sign for sar and brutus to advance towards us i was struck with a profound veneration at the sight of brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue the greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of his country and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of his countenance i observed with much pleasure that these two persons were in good intelligence with each other and sar freely confessed to me that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by many degrees to the glory of taking it away i had the honour to have much conversation with brutus and was told that his ancestor junius socrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himself were perpetually together a sextumvirate to which all the ages of the world cannot add a seventh it would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire i had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me i chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and usurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations but it is impossible to express the satisfaction i received in my own mind after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the reader chapter a further account of glubbdubdrib ancient and modern history corrected having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and learning i set apart one day on purpose i proposed that homer and aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court and outward rooms of the palace i knew and could distinguish those two heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other homer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect for one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i ever beheld aristotle stooped much and made use of a staff his visage was meagre his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow i soon discovered that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company and had never seen or heard of them before and i had a whisper from a ghost who shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the most distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through a consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity i introduced didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotle was out of all patience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presented them to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves i then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whom i prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle this great philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must do and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus as palatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally to be exploded he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof the present learned are such zealous asserters he said that new systems of nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and even those who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles would flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogue when that was determined i spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned i saw most of the first roman emperors i prevailed on the governor to call up heliogabalus s cooks to dress us a dinner but they could not show us much of their skill for want of materials a helot of agesilaus made us a dish of spartan broth but i was not able to get down a second spoonful the two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their private affairs to return in three days which i employed in seeing some of the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or three hundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and having been always a great admirer of old illustrious families i desired the governor would call up a dozen or two of kings with their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations but my disappointment was grievous and unexpected for instead of a long train with royal diadems i saw in one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italian prelate in another a barber an abbot and two cardinals i have too great a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice a subject but as to counts marquises dukes earls and the like i was not so scrupulous and i confess it was not without some pleasure that i found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain families are distinguished up to their originals i could plainly discover whence one family derives a long chin why a second has abounded with knaves for two generations and fools for two more why a third happened to be crackrained and a fourth to be sharpers whence it came what polydore virgil says of a certain great house nec vir fortis nec foemina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grew to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much as by their coats of arms who first brought the pox into a noble house which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity neither could i wonder at all this when i saw such an interruption of lineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters fiddlers players captains and pickpockets i was chiefly disgusted with modern history for having strictly examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for a hundred years past i found how the world had been misled by prostitute writers to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisest counsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayers of their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites truth to informers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the corruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profit how great a share in the motions and events of courts councils and senates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites and buffoons how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integrity when i was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success here i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write anecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves with a cup of poison will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief minister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortune to be mistaken here i discovered the true causes of many great events that have surprised the world how a whore can govern the backtairs the backtairs a council and the council a senate a general confessed in my presence that he got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct and an admiral that for want of proper intelligence he beat the enemy to whom he intended to betray the fleet three kings protested to me that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of merit unless by mistake or treachery of some minister in whom they confided neither would they do it if they were to live again and they showed with great strength of reason that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption because that positive confident restiff temper which virtue infused into a man was a perpetual clog to public business i had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner by what methods great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour and prodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very modern period however without grating upon present times because i would be sure to give no offence even to foreigners for i hope the reader need not be told that i do not in the least intend my own country in what i say upon this occasion a great number of persons concerned were called up and upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy that i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness perjury oppression subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities were among the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gave as it was reasonable great allowance but when some confessed they owed their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to the prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent i hope i may be pardoned if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that profound veneration which i am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity by us their inferiors i had often read of some great services done to princes and states and desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed upon inquiry i was told that their names were to be found on no record except a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest of rogues and traitors as to the rest i had never once heard of them they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most of them telling me they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on a scaffold or a gibbet among others there was one person whose case appeared a little singular he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side he told me he had for many years been commander of a ship and in the sea fight at actium had the good fortune to break through the enemy s great line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take a fourth which was the sole cause of antony s flight and of the victory that ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed in the action he added that upon the confidence of some merit the war being at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustus to be preferred to a greater ship whose commander had been killed but without any regard to his pretensions it was given to a boy who had never seen the sea the son of libertina who waited on one of the emperor s mistresses returning back to his own vessel he was charged with neglect of duty and the ship given to a favourite page of publicola the vicedmiral whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a great distance from rome and there ended his life i was so curious to know the truth of this story that i desired agrippa might be called who was admiral in that fight he appeared and confirmed the whole account but with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his merit i was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that empire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me less wonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well as pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had the least title to either as every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in the world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past how the pox under all its consequences and denominations had altered every lineament of an english countenance shortened the size of bodies unbraced the nerves relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced a sallow complexion and rendered the flesh loose and rancid i descended so low as to desire some english yeoman of the old stamp might be summoned to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their manners diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true spirit of liberty for their valour and love of their country neither could i be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead when i considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a piece of money by their grandhildren who in selling their votes and managing at elections have acquired every vice and corruption that can possibly be learned in a court chapter the author returns to maldonada sails to the kingdom of luggnagg the author confined he is sent for to court the manner of his admittance the king s great lenity to his subjects the day of our departure being come i took leave of his highness the governor of glubbdubdrib and returned with my two companions to maldonada where after a fortnight s waiting a ship was ready to sail for luggnagg the two gentlemen and some others were so generous and kind as to furnish me with provisions and see me on board i was a month in this voyage we had one violent storm and were under a necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind which holds for above sixty leagues on the st of april we sailed into the river of clumegnig which is a seaport town at the southast point of luggnagg we cast anchor within a league of the town and made a signal for a pilot two of them came on board in less than half an hour by whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very dangerous in the passage to a large basin where a fleet may ride in safety within a cable s length of the townall some of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence had informed the pilots that i was a stranger and great traveller whereof these gave notice to a customouse officer by whom i was examined very strictly upon my landing this officer spoke to me in the language of balnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understood in that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs i gave him a short account of some particulars and made my story as plausible and consistent as i could but i thought it necessary to disguise my country and call myself a hollander because my intentions were for japan and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to enter into that kingdom i therefore told the officer that having been shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on a rock i was received up into laputa or the flying island of which he had often hear and was now endeavouring to get to japan whence i might find a convenience of returning to my own country the officer said i must be confined till he could receive orders from court for which he would write immediately and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight i was carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door however i had the liberty of a large garden and was treated with humanity enough being maintained all the time at the king s charge i was invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was reported that i came from countries very remote of which they had never heard i hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter he was a native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and was a perfect master of both languages by his assistance i was able to hold a conversation with those who came to visit me but this consisted only of their questions and my answers the despatch came from court about the time we expected it contained a warrant for conducting me and my retinue to traldragdubh or trildrogdrib for it is pronounced both ways as near as i can remembe by a party of ten horse all my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter whom i persuaded into my service and at my humble request we had each of us a mule to ride on a messenger was despatched half a day s journey before us to give the king notice of my approach and to desire that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour when it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour to lick the dust before his footstool this is the court style and i found it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two days after my arrival i was commanded to crawl upon my belly and lick the floor as i advanced but on account of my being a stranger care was taken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensive however this was a peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank when they desire an admittance nay sometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court and i have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne he was not able to speak a word neither is there any remedy because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty s presence there is indeed another custom which i cannot altogether approve of when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner he commands the floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition which being licked up infallibly kills him in twentyour hours but in justice to this prince s great clemency and the care he has of his subjects lives wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of europe would imitate hi it must be mentioned for his honour that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after every such execution which if his domestics neglect they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure i myself heard him give directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution but maliciously had omitted it by which neglect a young lord of great hopes coming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king at that time had no design against his life but this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that he would do so no more without special orders to return from this digression when i had crept within four yards of the throne i raised myself gently upon my knees and then striking my forehead seven times against the ground i pronounced the following words as they had been taught me the night before inckpling gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht this is the compliment established by the laws of the land for all persons admitted to the king s presence it may be rendered into english thus may your celestial majesty outlive the sun eleven moons and a half to this the king returned some answer which although i could not understand yet i replied as i had been directed fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush which properly signifies my tongue is in the mouth of my friend and by this expression was meant that i desired leave to bring my interpreter whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention i answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour i spoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of luggnagg the king was much delighted with my company and ordered his bliffmarklub or highhamberlain to appoint a lodging in the court for me and my interpreter with a daily allowance for my table and a large purse of gold for my common expenses i staid three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his majesty who was pleased highly to favour me and made me very honourable offers but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family chapter the luggnaggians commended a particular description of the struldbrugs with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon that subject the luggnaggians are a polite and generous people and although they are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all eastern countries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especially such who are countenanced by the court i had many acquaintance and among persons of the best fashion and being always attended by my interpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeable one day in much good company i was asked by a person of quality whether i had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals i said i had not and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an appellation applied to a mortal creature he told me that sometimes though very rarely a child happened to be born in a family with a red circular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which was an infallible mark that it should never die the spot as he described it was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course of time grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old it became green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deep blue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an english shilling but never admitted any further alteration he said these births were so rare that he did not believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest a young girl born about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar to any family but a mere effect of chance and the children of the struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people i freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight upon hearing this account and the person who gave it me happening to understand the balnibarbian language which i spoke very well i could not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too extravagant i cried out as in a rapture happy nation where every child hath at least a chance for being immortal happy people who enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond all comparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exempt from that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free and disengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death i discovered my admiration that i had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction that i could not have easily overlooked it and it was impossible that his majesty a most judicious prince should not provide himself with a good number of such wise and able counsellors yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court and we often find by experience that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors however since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person i was resolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on this matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter and whether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing i was determined that his majesty having frequently offered me an establishment in this country i would with great thankfulness accept the favour and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior beings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit me the gentleman to whom i addressed my discourse because as i have already observe he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with a sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permission to explain to the company what i had spoke he did so and they talked together for some time in their own language whereof i understood not a syllable neither could i observe by their countenances what impression my discourse had made on them after a short silence the same person told me that his friends and mine so he thought fit to express himsel were very much pleased with the judicious remarks i had made on the great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they were desirous to know in a particular manner what scheme of living i should have formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a struldbrug i answered it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a subject especially to me who had been often apt to amuse myself with visions of what i should do if i were a king a general or a great lord and upon this very case i had frequently run over the whole system how i should employ myself and pass the time if i were sure to live for ever that if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a struldbrug as soon as i could discover my own happiness by understanding the difference between life and death i would first resolve by all arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches in the pursuit of which by thrift and management i might reasonably expect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom in the second place i would from my earliest youth apply myself to the study of arts and sciences by which i should arrive in time to excel all others in learning lastly i would carefully record every action and event of consequence that happened in the public impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and great ministers of state with my own observations on every point i would exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashions of dress diet and diversions by all which acquirements i should be a living treasure of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracle of the nation i would never marry after threescore but live in a hospitable manner yet still on the saving side i would entertain myself in forming and directing the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my own remembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examples of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life but my choice and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood among whom i would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my own contemporaries where any of these wanted fortunes i would provide them with convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them always at my table only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance and treat your posterity after the same manner just as a man diverts himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year these struldbrugs and i would mutually communicate our observations and memorials through the course of time remark the several gradations by which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every step by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added to the strong influence of our own example would probably prevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages add to this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states and empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities in ruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry and overwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknown barbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous become civilized i should then see the discovery of the longitude the perpetual motion the universal medicine and many other great inventions brought to the utmost perfection what wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving and confirming our own predictions by observing the progress and return of comets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and stars i enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with when i had ended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before to the rest of the company there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country not without some laughter at my expense at last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he was desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes which i had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature and upon that allowance was less answerable for them that this breed of struldbrugs was peculiar to their country for there were no such people either in balnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from his majesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to me that i received it as a thing wholly new and scarcely to be credited that in the two kingdoms above mentioned where during his residence he had conversed very much he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind that whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could that the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer and looked on death as the greatest evil from which nature always prompted him to retreat only in this island of luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of the struldbrugs before their eyes that the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust because it supposed a perpetuity of youth health and vigour which no man could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in his wishes that the question therefore was not whether a man would choose to be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and health but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages which old age brings along with it for although few men will avow their desires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the two kingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed that every man desired to put off death some time longer let it approach ever so late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except he were incited by the extremity of grief or torture and he appealed to me whether in those countries i had travelled as well as my own i had not observed the same general disposition after this preface he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugs among them he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty years old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected increasing in both till they came to fourscore this he learned from their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or three of that species born in an age they were too few to form a general observation by when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country they had not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying they were not only opinionative peevish covetous morose vain talkative but incapable of friendship and dead to all natural affection which never descended below their grandchildren envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions but those objects against which their envy seems principally directed are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old by reflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure and whenever they see a funeral they lament and repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they themselves never can hope to arrive they have no remembrance of anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and middlege and even that is very imperfect and for the truth or particulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common tradition than upon their best recollections the least miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet with more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities which abound in others if a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage is dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as the younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault of their own to a perpetual continuance in the world should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are looked on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates only a small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones are maintained at the public charge after that period they are held incapable of any employment of trust or profit they cannot purchase lands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any cause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers and bounds at ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age no distinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get without relish or appetite the diseases they were subject to still continue without increasing or diminishing in talking they forget the common appellation of things and the names of persons even of those who are their nearest friends and relations for the same reason they never can amuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve to carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end and by this defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might otherwise be capable the language of this country being always upon the flux the struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither are they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation farther than by a few general word with their neighbours the mortals and thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own country this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i can remember i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngest not above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several times by some of my friends but although they were told that i was a great traveller and had seen all the world they had not the least curiosity to ask me a question only desired i would give them slumskudask or a token of remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid the law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by the public although indeed with a very scanty allowance they are despised and hated by all sorts of people when one of them is born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded very particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register which however has not been kept above a thousand years past or at least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances but the usual way of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or great persons they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld and the women more horrible than the men besides the usual deformities in extreme old age they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number of years which is not to be described and among half a dozen i soon distinguished which was the eldest although there was not above a century or two between them the reader will easily believe that from what i had hear and seen my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated i grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed and thought no tyrant could invent a death into which i would not run with pleasure from such a life the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing i could send a couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people against the fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom or else i should have been well content with the trouble and expense of transporting them i could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like circumstances otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of old age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole nation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities to manage must end in the ruin of the public chapter the author leaves luggnagg and sails to japan from thence he returns in a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to england i thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainment to the reader because it seems to be a little out of the common way at least i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that has come to my hands and if i am deceived my excuse must be that it is necessary for travellers who describe the same country very often to agree in dwelling on
