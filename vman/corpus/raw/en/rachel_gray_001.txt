in one of the many little suburbs which cling to the outskirts of london there is a silent and grassrown street of aspect both quiet and quaint the houses are crazy old and brown of every height and every size many are untenanted some years ago one was internally destroyed by fire it was not thought worth rebuilding there it still stands gaunt and grim looking for all the world with its broken or dusttained windows like a town deserted after a sacking this street is surrounded by populous courts and alleys by stirring thoroughfares by roads full of activity and commerce yet somehow or other all the noise of life all its tumult and agitation here seem to die away to silence and repose few people even amongst the poor and the neighbourhood is a poor one care to reside in it while they can be lodged as cheaply close by and more to their taste some think that the old square at the end with its ancient nodding trees is close and gloomy others have heard strange noises in the house that has suffered from fire and are sure it is haunted and some again do not like the silent deserted look of the place and cannot get over the fancy that if no one will live in it it must be because it is unlucky and thus it daily decays more and more and daily seems to grow more silent the appearance of the few houses that are inhabited says little in favour of this unfortunate street in one a tailor has taken up his abode he is a pale serious man who stitches at his board in the window the whole day long cheered by the occasional song of a thrush hopping in its osier cage this tailor samuel hopkins yclept lives by repairing damaged vestments he once made a coat and boasts ith how much truth is known to his own heart hat he likewise cut out fashioned and fitted a pair of blue nether garments further on at the corner of the square stands the house of mrs adams an aged widow who keeps a small school which on her brass board she emphatically denominates her establishment for young ladies this house has an unmistakeable air of literary dirt and neglect the area and kitchen windows are encumbered with the accumulated mud and dust of years from the attic casement a little redaired servantirl is ever gaping and on hot summer afternoons when the parlour windows are left open there is a glimpse within of a dingy schoolistress and still more dingy schooloom with a few pupils who sit straggling on halfozen benches conning their lessons with a murmuring hum with one exception there is no other sign of commerce trade or profession in the whole street for all an outward glance can reveal to the contrary the people who live there are so very rich that they do not need to work at all or so very genteel in their decay that if they do work they must do it in a hidden skulking invisible sort of fashion or else be irretrievably disgraced the solitary exception to which we have alluded exists or rather existed for though we speak in the present we write in the past by some years in one of the smallest houses in the street a little sixoomed house it was exactly facing the dreary haunted mansion and exposed to all the noises aforesaid it was also to say the truth an abode of poor and mean aspect in the window hung a dressaker board on which was modestly inscribed with a list of prices the name of rachel gray it was accompanied with patterns of yellow paper sleeves trimmed in every colour an old book of fashions and beautiful and bright as if reared in wood or meadow a pot of yellow crocuses in bloom they were closing now for evening was drawing in and they knew the hour they had opened to light in the dingy parlour within and which we will now enter it was but a little room and the soft gloom of a spring twilight halfilled it the furniture though poor and oldashioned was scrupulously clean and it shone again in the flickering fireight a few discoloured prints in black frames hung against the walls two or three broken china ornaments adorned the wooden mantelhelf which was moreover decorated with a little darkooking mirror in a rim of tarnished gold by the fire an elderly woman of grave and stern aspect but who had once been handsome sat reading the newspaper near the window two apprentices sewed under the superintendence of rachel gray a mild ray of light fell on her pale face and bending figure she sewed on serious and still and the calm gravity of her aspect harmonized with the silence of the little parlour which nothing disturbed save the ticking of an old clock behind the door the occasional rustling of mrs gray newspaper and the continuous and monotonous sound of stitching rachel gray looked upwards of thirty yet she was younger by some years she was a tall thin and awkward woman sallow and faded before her time she was not and had never been handsome yet there was a patient seriousness in the lines of her face which when it caught the eye arrested it at once and kept it long her brow too was broad and intellectual her eyes were very fine though their look was dreamy and abstracted and her smile when she did smile which was not often for she was slightly deaf and spoke little was pleasant and very sweet she sewed on as we have said abstracted and serious when gradually for even in observation she was slow the yellow crocuses attracted her attention she looked at them meditatively and watched them closing with the decline of day and at length as if she had not understood until then what was going on before her she smiled and admiringly exclaimed now do look at the creatures mother mrs gray glanced up from her newspaper and snuffed rather disdainfully lawk rachel she said you don mean to call crocuses creatures o you il tell you what though she added with a doleful shake of the head i don know what her majesty thinks but i say the country can stand it much longer mrs gray had been cook in a prime minister household and this had naturally given her a political turn the lord has taught you murmured rachel bending over the flowers with something like awe and a glow spread over her sallow cheek and there came a light to her large brown eyes of the two apprentices ne a sickly fretful girl of sixteen heard her not she went on sewing and the very way in which she drew her needle and thread was peevish the other apprentice did hear rachel and she looked or rather stared at the dressaker with grim wonder indeed there was something particularly grim about this young maiden drear stolidity that defies describing a pure saxon she was o infusion of celtic or danish or norman blood had lightened the native weight of her nature she was young yet she already went through life settling everything and living in a moral tower of most uninviting aspect but though jane settled everything she did not profess to understand everything and when as happened every now and then rachel gray came out with such remarks as that above recorded jane felt confounded she couldn make out miss gray hat she couldn i so tired peevishly said mary the fretful apprentice at once rachel kindly observed put by your work dear again mrs gray snuffed and came out with lawk she always grummy mary tossed away her work folded her arms and looked sullen jane the grim apprentice drew her needle and thread twice as fast as before thank heaven she piously thought i am not lazy nor sickly and i can see much difference between the two hat i can rachel work lay in her lap she sat looking at the crocuses until she fell in a dream far in the past for the past is our realm free to all high or low who wish to dwell in it there we may set aside the bitterness and the sorrow there we may choose none but the pleasing visions the bright sunny spots where it is sweet to linger the future fair as hope may make it is a dream we claim it in vain the present harsh or delightful must be endured yet it flies from us before we can say it is gone but the past is ours to call up at our will it is vivid and distinct as truth in good and in evil it is irrevocable the divine seal has been set upon it for evermore in that book pure and holy one was hers hough not without a few dark and sad pages achel gray often read and now the sight of the yellow flower of spring took her back to a happy day of her childhood she saw herself a little girl again with her younger sister jane and the whole school to which they belonged out on a holiday treat in a green forest near that forest there was a breezy field and there it was that rachel first saw the yellow crocuses bloom she remembered her joy her delight at the wonderful beauty of the wild field flowers ow she and jane heaped their laps with them and sat down at the task and how when tired with the pleasant labour they rested as many yellow crocuses as before seemed to blow and play in the breeze around them and she remembered too how even then there passed across her childish mind a silent wonder at their multitude an undefined awe for the power of the almighty hand who made the little flower and bade it bloom in the green fields beneath the misty azure of a soft spring sky and then swiftly followed other thoughts where was little blueyed jane her younger sister her little companion and friend sleeping in a london grave far from the pleasant and sunny spots where god wild flowers bloom and she hy she was pursuing her path in life doing the will of god almighty and what more thought rachel can i hope or wish for now rachel what are you moping about tartly asked her mother who though half blind had a quick eye for her daughter meditative fits abruptly fled the dream the childish memories the holy remembrance of the dead sank back once more to their quiet restinglace in rachel heart wakening up with a halfightened start she hastily resumed her work i don think there ever was such a moper as that girl grumbled mrs gray to herself rachel smiled cheerfully in her mother face but as to telling her that she had been thinking of the yellow crocuses and of the spots they grew in and of the power and greatness and glory of him who made them rachel did not dream of it there mrs brown said mrs gray as a dark figure passed by the window go and open the door mary mary did not stir upon which jane officiously rose and said il go she went and in came or rather bounced mrs brown short stout vulgarooking woman of fifty or so who at once filled the room with noise la mrs gray she began breathlessly what do you think there a new one i have brought you the paper third column second page first article he church in a mess i thought you like to see it well rachel and how are you getting on mrs james dress don fit her a bit and she says shel not give you another stitch of work but la you don care o you why mary how yellow you look to day i declare youe as yellow as the crocuses in the pot ain she now jane and so youe not married yet re you my girl she added giving the grim apprentice a slap on the back jane eyed her quietly you better not do that again mrs brown she said with some sternness and as to getting married why sose you mind your own business mrs brown threw herself back in her chair and laughed until the tears ran down her face when she recovered it was to address mrs gray la mrs gray can you find it she said why i told you third column second page he church in a mess you can miss i have put a pin in it spite of this kind attention mrs gray had not found the church in a mess lawk mrs brown she said impatiently where the use of always raking up them sort of things the badness of others don make us good does it it the taxes i think of mrs brown it the taxes now rachel where are you going i am going to take home this work mother unable to find fault with this mrs gray muttered to herself she was not illatured but faultinding was with her an inveterate habit la what a muff that girl of yours is mrs gray charitably observed mrs brown as rachel left the room for mrs brown being mrs gray cousin landlady and neighbour took the right to say everything she pleased she ain particlerly bright confessed mrs gray poking the fire but you see mrs brown rachel closed the door and heard no more whilst mrs brown was talking she had been tying up her parcel she now put on her bonnet and cloak and went out it is sweet after the toil of a day to breathe fresh air london air even though it should be it is sweet after the long closeness of the workoom to walk out and feel the sense of life and liberty a new being seemed poured into rachel as she went on i wonder people do not like this street she thought pausing at the corner to look back on the grey quiet line she was leaving behind they call it dull and to me it is so calm and sweet and she sighed to enter the noisy and populous world before her she hastily crossed it and only slackened her pace when she reached the wide streets the mansions with gardens to them the broad and silent squares of the west end she stopped before a handsome house the abode of a rich lady who occasionally employed her because she worked cheaper than a fashionable dressaker and as well mrs moxton was engaged isitors were with her achel had to wait she sat in the hall a stylish footman who quickly detected that she was shy and nervous entertained himself and his companions by making her ten times more so his speech was rude is jests were insolent rachel was meek and humble but she could feel insult and that pride from which few of god creatures are free rose within her and flushed her pale cheek with involuntary displeasure at length the infliction ceased mrs moxton visitors left rachel was called in her first impulse had been to complain of the footman to his mistress but mercy checked the temptation it might make him lose his place poor rachel she little knew that this footman could have been insolent to his mistress herself had he so chosen he was six foot three and in his livery of brown and gold looked splendid in short he was invaluable and not to be parted with on any account mrs moxton was habitually a wellred goodatured woman but every rule has its exceptions rachel found her very much out of temper to say the truth one of her recent visitors was in the mrs brown style mrs moxton had been provoked and irritated and rachel paid for it now miss gray she said with solemn indignation what do you mean by bringing back work in this style that flounce is at least an inch too high i thought you an intelligent young person ut really really it very easily altered mam said rachel submissively you need not trouble gravely replied mrs moxton i owe you something you may call with your bill toorrow i shall not be able to call toorrow mam and if it were convenient now it is not convenient now said mrs morton rather haughtily she thought rachel the most impertinent creature she had ever met with hat is to say next to that irritating mrs maberly who had repeated that provoking thing about mr sondo rachel sighed and left the house like all shy persons she was easily depressed it was night when she stood once more in the street above the pale outline of the houses spread a sky of dark azure a star shone in it a little star but it burned with as brilliant a light as any great planet rachel gazed at it earnestly and the shadow passed away what matter she thought even though a man in livery made a jest of me ven though a lady in silk was scornful what matter god made that star for me as well as for her besides she added checking a thought which might she feared be too proud besides who and what am i that i should repine chapter rachel went on but she did not turn homewards she left the broad and airy strait where mrs moxton lived she entered a narrow one long and gloomy it led her into a large and gasit square she crossed it without looking right or left a thought led her on like a spell through streets and alleys by lanes and courts n she went until at length she stood in the heart of a populous neighbourhood cars were dashing along the pavement night vendors were screaming at their stalls where tallow lights flared in the night wind drunken men were shouting in gin palaces wretched looking women were coming out of pawnbroker shops and precocious london children were pouring into a theatre where their morals were to be improved and their understandings were to be enlightened at the moderate rate of a penny a head rachel sighed at all she saw and divined poor things she thought if they only knew better but this compassionate feeling did not exclude a sort of fear rachel kept as much as she could in the gloomy part of the streets she shrank back nervously from every rude group and thus she at length succeeded in attracting the very thing she most wished to shun bservation three or four women rushing out of a publicouse caught sight of her timid figure at once one of them he was more than halfntoxicated urst out into a loud shouting laugh and seizing rachel arm swung her round on the pavement let me go said rachel i am in a hurry she trembled from head to foot and vainly tried to put on the appearance of a courage she felt not give me something for drink then insolently said the woman rachel momentary fear was already over she had said to herself and what can happen to me without god will and the thought had nerved her she looked very quietly at the woman flushed and bloated face and as quietly she said you have drunk too much already let me go no i won hoarsely replied her tormentor and she used language which though it could not stain the pure heart of her who heard it brought the blush of anger and shame to her cheek let me go she said trembling this time with indignation yes es let the young woman go molly observed one of the woman companions who had hitherto looked on apathetically she officiously disengaged rachel arm whispering as she did so you better cut now hold her molly awful when she got them fits on rachel hastened away followed by the derisive shout of the whole group she turned down the first street she found it was dark and silent yet rachel did not stop until she reached the very end of it then she paused to breathe a while but when she put her hand in her pocket for her handkerchief it was gone with it had disappeared her purse and two or three shillings rachel saw and understood it all he friend of molly her officious deliverer was a pickocket she hung down her head and sighed dismayed and astonished not at her loss but at the sin ah dear lord jesus she thought full of sorrow that thou shouldst thus be crucified anew by the sins of thy people then followed the perplexing inward question oh why is there so much sin god knows best was the inward reply and once more calm and serene rachel went on at first she hardly knew where she was she stood in a dark thoroughfare where three streets met hree narrow streets that scarcely broke on the surrounding gloom hesitatingly she took the first it happened to be that which she wanted when rachel recognized it her pace slackened her heart beat her colour came and went she was much moved she prayed too he prayed with her whole heart but she walked very slowly and thus she reached at length a lonely little street not quite so gloomy as that which she had been following she paused at the corner shop for a moment it was a secondand ironmonger rusty iron locks and rusty tongs and shovels and rusty goods of every description kept grim company to tattered books and a few old pictures that had contracted an iron look in their vicinity a solitary gasight lit the whole rachel stopped and looked at the books and at the pictures but only for a few seconds if she stood there it was not to gaze with passing curiosity on those objects she knew them all of old as she knew every stone of that street it was to wait until the flush of her cheek had subsided and the beating of her heart had grown still at length she went on when she reached the middle of the street she paused she stood near a dark house shrouded within the gloom of its doorway opposite her on the other side of the way was a small shop lit from within from where she stood rachel could see everything that passed in that abode a carpenter lived there for the place was full of rough deal boards standing erect against the wall and the floor was heaped high with shavings presently a door within opened the master of the shop entered it and set himself to work by the light of a tallow candle he was a tall thin man greyeaded and deeply wrinkled but strong and hale for his years as he bent over his work the light of the candle vividly defined his angular figure and sharp features rachel looked at him her eyes filled with tears she brushed them away with her hand for they prevented her from seeing but they returned thicker and faster oh my father my father she cried within her heart why must i stand here in darkness looking at you why cannot i go in to you like other daughters to their father why do you not love your child her heart seemed full to bursting her eyes overflowed her breathing was broken by sobs and in the simple and pathetic words of scripture she turned away her head and raised her voice and wept aloud rachel gray was the daughter of the greyeaded carpenter by a first wife soon after whose death he had married again mrs gray was his second wife and the mother of his youngest daughter she was kind in her way but that was at the best a harsh one rachel was a timid retiring child plain awkward and sallow with nothing to attract the eye and little to please the fancy mrs gray did not use her ill certainly but neither did she give her any great share in her affections and why and how should a stepother have loved rachel when her own father did not when almost from her birth she had been to him as though she did not exist s a being who uncalled for and unwanted had come athwart his life never had he to her knowledge taken her in his arms or on his knee never had he kissed or caressed her never addressed to her one word of fondness or even of common kindness neither it is true had he illsed nor illreated her he felt no unnatural aversion for his own flesh and blood nothing beyond a deep and incurable indifference for her his heart remained as a barren and arid soil on which the sweet flower of love could never bloom there was but one being in this narrow circle who really and fondly loved rachel gray and this was jane her little halfister rachel was her elder by full five years when she was told one morning that jane was born she heard the tidings with silent awe then with eager curiosity climbed up on a chair to peep at the rosy baby fast asleep in its cradle from that day she had but one thought er little sister how describe the mingled love and pride with which rachel received the baby when it was first confided to her care and when to her was allotted the delightful task of dragging about in her arms a heavy screaming child and who but rachel found jane first tooth who but rachel taught jane to speak and taught her how to walk who else fulfilled for the helpless infant and wilful child every little office of kindness and of love until at length there woke in her own childish heart some of that maternal fondness born with woman the feeling whence her deepest woes and her highest happiness alike must spring when her father was unkind when her stepother was hasty rachel turned for comfort to her little sister in her childish caresses and words and ways she found solace and consolation she did not feel it hard that she was to be the slave of a spoiled child to wash comb and dress her to work for her to carry her to sing to her to play with her and that not when she liked but when it pleased jane all this rachel did not mind ane loved her she knew it she was sure of it and where there is love there cannot be tyranny thus the two sisters grew up together until one day without previous warning thomas gray went off to america and coolly left his wife and children behind mrs gray was a good and an upright woman she reared her husband child like her own and worked for both without ever repining at the double burden when her husband returned to england after three years absence mrs gray lost no time in compelling him to grant her a weekly allowance for herself and for the support of her children thomas gray could not resist the claim but he gave what the law compelled him to give and no more he never returned to live with his wife he never expressed a wish to see either of his daughters he had been back some years when little jane died at thirteen she died dreaming of heaven with her hand in that of rachel and her head on rachel bosom she died blessing her eldest sister with her last breath with love for her in the last look of her blue eyes in the last smile of her wan lips it was a happy deathed ne to waken hope not to call forth sorrow and yet what became of the life of rachel when jane was gone for a long time it was a dreary void melancholy succession of days and weeks and months from which the happy light had fled rom which something sweet and delightful was gone for ever for though it may be sweeter to love than to be loved yet it is hard always to give and never to receive in return and when jane died rachel knew well enough that all the love she had to receive upon earth had been given unto her like the lost pleiad seen no more below the bright star of her life had left the sky it burned in other heavens with more celestial light but it shone no longer over her path o cheer to comfort to illume mrs gray was kind after her own fashion she loved rachel they had grieved and suffered together from the same sorrows and kindred griefs can bind the farthest hearts but beyond this there was no sympathy between them and mrs gray affection such as it was was free from a particle of tenderness she was not naturally a patient or an amiable woman and she had endured great and unmerited wrongs from rachel father perhaps she would have been more than human had she not occasionally reminded her stepaughter of mr thomas gray misdeeds and now and then taunted her with a he never cared about you ou know aye achel knew it well enough she knew that her own father loved her not hat though he had cared little for jane not being a tenderearted man still that he had cared somewhat for that younger and more favoured child that before he left england he would occasionally caress her that when she died tears had flowed down his stern cheek on hearing the tidings and that the words had escaped him i am sorry i was not there all this rachel knew her mind was too noble and too firm for jealousy her heart too pious and too humble for rebellious sorrow but yet she found it hard to bear and very hard to be reminded of it as a reproach and a shame was it not enough that she could not win the affection she most longed for she was devoted to her stepother she had fondly loved her younger sister but earlier born in her heart than these two loves deeper and more solemn was the love rachel felt for her father that instinct of nature which in him was silent in her spoke strongly that share of love which he denied her she silently added to her own and united both in one fervent offering harshness and indifference had no power to quench a feeling to which love in kindness had not given birth she loved because it was her destiny because as she once said herself when speaking of another a daughter heart clings to her father with boundless charity young as she was when thomas gray left his home rachel remembered him well his looks the very tones of his voice were present to her not once during the years of his absence did the thought of her father cease to haunt her heart when from the bitter remarks of her stepother she learned that he had returned and where he had taken up his home she had no peace until she succeeded in obtaining a glimpse of him free as are all the children of the poor she made her way to the street where he lived and many a day walked for weary miles in order to pass by her father door but she never crossed the threshold never spoke to him never let him know who she was until the sad day when she bore to him the news of her sister death he received her with his usual coldness n such emotion as he showed she had no share like strangers they had met ike strangers they parted but though his coldness and her own timidity prevented nearer advances they did not prevent rachel from often seeking the remote neighbourhood and gloomy street where her father dwelt it was a pleasure though a sad one to look on his face even if she went not near him and thus it happened that on this dark night she stood in the sheltering obscurity of the wellnown doorway gazing on the solitary old man yet venturing not to cross the narrow street the wind blew from the east it was cold and piercing yet it could not draw rachel from her vigil of love still she looked and lingered wishing she knew not what and hoping against hope thus she stayed until thomas gray left his work put up the shutters then left the house by the private door and slowly walked away to the nearest publicouse the shop was once more a blank in the dark street rachel looked at the deserted dwelling and sighed than softly and silently she stole away chapter it was late when rachel reached home she found her stepother sitting up for her rigid amazed y indignant o indignant indeed that though she rated rachel soundly for her audacity in presuming to stay out so long without previous leave obtained she quite forgot to inquire particularly why she had not come home earlier a series of disasters had been occasioned by rachel absence jane and mary had quarrelled mrs gray had been kept an hour waiting for her supper the beer had naturally become flat and worthless and whilst mrs gray was sleeping nd how could she help sleeping being quite faint and exhausted with her long vigil uss had got up on the table and walked off with rachel polony there was a touch of quiet humour in rachel and with a demure smile she internally wondered why it was precisely her polony that had been selected by puss but aloud she merely declared that she could make an excellent supper on bread and beer mrs gray who held the reins of domestic management in their little household assured her that she had better for that nothing else was she going to get she sat down heroically determined to eat the whole of her polony in order to punish and provoke her stepaughter but somehow or other the half of that dainty had before the end of the meal found its way to the plate of rachel who when she protested against this act of generosity was imperiously ordered to hold her tongue which order she did not dare to resist for if mrs gray heart was mellow her temper was sufficiently tart the apprentices had long been gone to bed as soon as supper was over mrs gray intimated to rachel the propriety of following their example rachel ventured to demur meekly i cannot mother have work to finish then better have sat at home and finished it than have gone gadding about and nearly got a pitch plaster on your mouth grumbled mrs gray who was a firm believer in pitch plasters and abductions and highway robberies and all sorts of horrors mind you don set the house a fire she added retiring why mother said rachel smiling you treat me like a child and i am twentyix what about that when you aint got no more sense than a baby rachel did not venture to dispute a proposition so distinctly stated she remained up and sat sewing until her work was finished she then took out from some secret repository a small end of candle lit it and extinguished the long candle by the light of which she had been working from her pocket she took a small key it opened a workox whence she drew a shirt collar finely stitched she worked until her eyes ached but she heeded it not until they closed with involuntary fatigue and sleep and still she would not obey the voice of wearied nature still she stitched for love like the poor shirtmaker for bread until without previous warning her candle end suddenly flickered then expired in its socket and left her in darkness rachel gently opened the window and partly unclosed the shutter the moon was riding in the sky above the old house opposite her pale clear light glided over its brown walls and the quiet street down into the silent parlour of rachel she looked around her moved at seeing familiar objects under an unusual aspect in that old chair she had often seen her father sitting on such a moonlight night as this she and jane then already declining had sat by the window and looking at that same sky had talked with youthful fervour of high and eternal things and now jane knew the divine secrets she had guessed from afar and thomas gray alas was a stranger and an alien in his own home who knows thought rachel but he will return some day who knows who can tell life is long and hope is eternal ah if he should come back even though he never looked at me never spoke blessed thrice blessed should ever be held the day and a prayer not framed in words but in deep feelings gushed like a pure spring from her inmost heart but indeed when did she not pray when was god divided from her thoughts when did prayer fail to prompt the kind gentle words that fell from her lips or to lend its daily grace to a pure and blameless life for to her god was not what he alas is to so many n unapproachable deity to be worshipped from afar in fear and trembling or a cold though sublime abstraction no jesus was her friend her counsellor her refuge there was familiarity and tenderness in her very love for him and though she scarcely knew it herself a deep and fervent sense of his divine humanity of those thirtyhree years of earthly life of toil of poverty of trouble and of sorrow which move our very hearts within us when we look from bethlehem to calvary from the lowly birth in the manger to the bitter death on the cross we might ask were these the pages to raise such questions why jesus is not more loved thus s a friend and a dear one rather than as a cold master to be served not for love but for wages but let it rest sufficient is it for us to know that not thus did rachel gray love him but with a love in which humility and tenderness equally blended after a meditative pause she quietly put away her things by moonlight then again closed shutter and window and softly stole up to the room which she shared with her stepother she soon fell asleep and dreamed that she had gone to live with her father who said to her rachel rachel so great was her joy that she awoke she found her mother already up and scolding her because she still slept mother asked rachel leaning up on one elbow was it you who called me rachel why aint i been a calling of you this last hour asked mrs gray with much asperity rachel checked a sigh and rose get up jane et up mary said mrs gray rapping soundly at the room door of the two apprentices let them sleep a little longer poor young things implored rachel no that i won replied her mother with great determination lazy little creatures and to the imminent danger of her own knuckles she rapped so pertinaciously that jane and mary were unable to feign deafness and replied the former acting as spokeswoman that mrs gray needn be making all that noise for that they heard her and were getting up i thought i make them hear me muttered mrs gray hobbling down stairs there are some beings who lead lives so calm that when they look back on years they seem to read the story of a few days and of these was rachel gray life for her flowed dull monotonous and quiet as that of a nun in her cloister the story of one day was the story of the next a few hopes a few precious thoughts she treasured in her heart but outwardly to work to hear idle gossip to eat drink and sleep seemed her whole portion her destiny from mom till night from birth to the grave like every day passed this day when it grew so dark that she could see no more to work she put her task by and softly stole away to a little back room uptairs it was a very small room indeed with a bed where the apprentices slept a chest of drawers a table and two chairs any a closet is larger its solitary window looked out on the little yard below low walls against which grew rachel stocks and walllowers enclosed it from the next house there came the laughter and the screams too of children and of babies and from a neighbouring forge a loud yet not unmusical clanking with which now and then blended the rude voices of the men singing snatches of popular songs dimmed by the smoke of the forge and by the natural heaviness of a london atmosphere the sky enclosed all yet even through the smoke and haze fair rosy gleams of the setting sun shone in that london sky and at the zenith there was a space of pure ethereal blue oft and very far from sinful and suffering earth where glittered in calm beauty a large and tranquil star rachel sat by the window she listened to earth she looked at heaven her heart swelled with love and prayer and tenderness and hope tears of delight filled her eyes she murmured to herself verses from psalms and hymns praising god all telling the beauty of god creation oh pure and beautiful indeed would be the story of these your evening musings if we could lightly tell it here rachel gray reader if to learn how a fine nature found its way through darkness and mist and some suffering to the highest and to the noblest of the delights god has granted to man he religious and the intellectual if we say to learn this give you pleasure you may read on to the end of the chapter if not pass on at once to the next these pages were not written for you and even though you should read them feel and understand them you never will our life is twofold and of that double life which like all of us rachel bore within her we have as yet said but little she was now twenty six a tall thin sallow woman ungraceful of shy manners and but little speech but with a gentle face a broad forehead and large brown eyes by trade she was a dressaker of small pretensions her father had forsaken her early and her stepother had reared her this much knew the little world in which moved rachel gray this much and no more we may add that this some little world had in its wisdom pronounced rachel gray a fool her education had been very limited she knew how to read and she could write but neither easily nor well for though god had bestowed on her the rare dower of a fine mind he had not added to it the much more common though infinitely less precious gift of a quick intellect she learned slowly with great difficulty with sore pain and trouble her teachers one and all pronounced her dull her stepother was ashamed of her and to her dying day thought rachel no better than a simpleton rachel felt this keenly but she had no means of selfefence she had not the least idea of how she could prove that she was not an idiot one of the characteristics of childhood and of youth is a painful inability an entire powerlessness of giving the form of speech to its deepest and most fervent feelings the infirmity generally dies off with years perhaps because also dies off the very strength of those feelings but even as they were to last for ever with rachel gray so was that infirmity destined to endure shy sensitive and nervous she was a noble book sealed to all save god at eleven her education such as it was was over rachel had to work and earn her bread she was reared religiously and hers was a deeply religious nature the misapplication of religion narrows still more a narrow mind but religion taken in its true sense enlarges a noble one yet not without strife not without suffering did rachel make her way she was ignorant and she was alone how to ask advice she knew not for she could not explain herself sometimes she seemed to see the most sublime truths plain as in a book at other times they floated dark and clouded before her gaze or vanished in deep obscurity and left her alone and cast down she suffered years until from her very sufferings perfect faith was born and from faith unbounded trust in god after which her soul sank in deep and blessed peace and now when rest was won there came the want for more religion is love rachel wanted thought that child of the intellect as love is the child of the heart she did not know herself what it was that she needed until she discovered and possessed it ntil she could read a book a pamphlet a scrap of verse and brood over it like a bird over her young not for hours not for days but for weeks lest in that silent meditation her mind was tenacious but slow she read few books any would have disturbed her sweeter and pleasanter was it to rachel to think over what she did read and to treasure it up in the chambers of her mind than to fill those chambers with heaps of knowledge indeed for knowledge rachel cared comparatively little in such as displayed more clearly the glories of god creation she delighted but man learning man science touched her not to think was her delight a silent solitary forbidden pleasure in which rachel had to indulge by stealth for all this time and especially since the death of her sister she suffered keenly from home troubles from a little domestic persecution painful pertinacious and irritating mrs gray vaguely felt that her daughter was not like other girls and not knowing that she was in reality very far beyond most feeling too that rachel was wholly unlike herself and jealously resenting the fact she teased her unceasingly and did her best to interrupt the fits of meditation which she did not scruple to term moping when her mind was most haunted with some fine thought rachel had to talk to her stepother to listen to her and to take care not to reply at random if she failed in any of these obligations halfnour lecture was the least penalty she could expect dear to her for this reason were the few moments of solitude she could call her own dear to her was that little room where she could steal away at twilight time and think in peace very unlike her age was this ignorant dressaker of the nineteenth century ask the men and women of the day to read volumes why there is not a season but they go through the herculean labour of swallowing down histories written faster than time flies novels by the dozen essays philosophic and political books of travels of science of statistics besides the nameless host of reviews magazines and papers daily and weekly ask them to study why what is there they do not know from the most futile accomplishment to the most abstruse science ask them too if you like to enter life to view it under all its aspects why they have travelled over the whole earth and life they know from the palace down to the hovel but bid them think they stare aghast it is the task of sisyphus he labour of the danaide as fast as thought enters their mind it goes out again bid them commune one day with god and their own hearts hey reply dejectedly that they cannot for their intellect is quick and brilliant but their heart is cold and thought springs from the heart and in her heart had rachel gray found it the task impossible to them was to her easy and delightful time wore on deeper and more exquisite grew what rachel quaintly termed to herself the pleasure of thinking and oh she thought sometimes and it was a thought that made her heart bum oh that people only knew the pleasures of thinking oh if people would only think and mom and noon and night and bending over her work or sitting at peaceful twilight time in the little back room rachel thought and thus she went on through life between those two fair sisters thought and prayer reader hare you known many thinkers we confess that we hare known many men and women of keen and great intellect some geniuses but only one real thinker have we known only one who really thought for thought own sake and that one was rachel gray and now if she moves through this story thinking much and doing little you know why chapter it was not merely in meditation that rachel indulged when she sought the little room the divine did not banish the human from her heart and she had friends known to her but from that back room window but friends they were and in their way and degree valued ones first came the neighbour children by standing up on an old wooden stool in the yard they could see rachel at her window and rachel could see them they were rude and ignorant little things enough and no better than young heathens in rearing and knowledge yet they liked to hear rachel singing hymns in a low voice they even caught from her scraps of verses and sang them in their own fashion and when rachel hearing this took courage to open a conversation with them and to teach them as well as she could she found in them voluntary and sufficiently docile pupils their intercourse indeed was brief and limited to a few minutes every evening that rachel could steal up to her little room but it was cordial and free another friend had rachel yet one with whom she had never exchanged speech there existed at the back of mrs gray house a narrow court inhabited by the poorest of the poor over part of this court mrs gray back windows commanded a prospect which few would have envied yet it had proved to rachel the source of the truest and the keenest pleasure from her window rachel could look clearly into a low damp cellar opposite the abode of a little old frenchwoman known in the neighbourhood as mad madame rose madame rose as she called herself was a very diminutive old woman unusually so but small and neat in all her limbs and brisk in all her movements she was dry too and brown as a nut with a restless black eye and a voluble tongue which she exercised mostly in her native language ot that madame rose could not speak english she had resided some fifteen years in london and could say es and o quite fluently her attire looked peculiar in this country but it suited her person excellently well it was simply that of a french peasant woman with high peaked cap and kerchief both snowhite short petticoats and full a wide apron clattering wooden shoes and blue stockings what wind of fortune had wafted this little french fairy to a london cellar no one ever knew how she lived was almost as great a mystery every sunday morning she went forth with a little wooden stool and planted herself at the door of the french chapel she asked for nothing but took what she got indeed her business there did not seem to be to get anything but to make herself busy she nodded to every one who went in or out gave unaskedor information and assisted the policeman in keeping the carriages in order she darted in and out among wheels and horses with reckless audacity and once to the infinite wrath of a fat liveried coachman she suspended herself he was rather short rom the aristocratic reins he held and boldly attempted to turn the heads of his horses on week days madame rose stayed in her cellar and knitted it was this part of her life which rachel knew and it was the most beautiful for this little laughedt being who lived upon charity was herself all charity never yet for five years that rachel had watched her had she seen madame rose alone in her cellar poor girls who looked very much like outasts old and infirm women helpless children had successively shared the home the bed and the board of madame rose for her seemed written the beautiful record i was naked and ye clothed me i was hungry and ye fed me athirst and ye gave me drink and i was houseless and you sheltered me with humble admiration rachel saw a charity and a zeal which she could not imitate like mary she could sit at the feet of the lord and looking up listen rapt and absorbed to the divine teaching but the spirit of martha the holy zeal and fervour with which she bade welcome to her heavenly guest were not among the gifts of rachel gray yet the pleasure with which she stood in the corner of her own window and looked down into the cellar of madame rose was not merely that of religious sympathy or admiration as she saw it this evening with the tallow light that burned on the table rendering every object minutely distinct rachel looked with another feeling than that of mere curiosity she looked with the artistic pleasure we feel when we gaze at some clearlyainted dutch picture with its backround of soft gloom and its homely details of domestic life relieved by touches of brilliant light poor as this cellar was a painter would have liked it well he would surely have delighted in the brown and crazy clothesress that stood at the further end massive and dark in the shining kitchen utensils that decorated the walls in the low and manyoloured bed in the clean white deal table in the smouldering fire that burned in that dark grate like a red eye especially would he have gloried in the quaint little figure of madame rose she had been cooking her supper and she now sat down to it in doing so she caught sight of rachel figure they were acquainted hat is to say that madame rose partly aware of the interest rachel took in such glimpses as she obtained of her own daily life favoured her with tokens of recognition whenever she caught sight of her far or near she now nodded in friendly style laughed nodded again and with that communicativeness which formed part of her character successively displayed every article of her supper for rachel inspection first came a dishful of dark liquid nion soup it was hen a piece of bread not a large one then two apples then a small bit of cheese for madame rose was a frenchwoman and she would have her soup and her dish and her dessert no matter on what scale or in what quantity but the supper of madame rose did not alone attract the attention and interest of rachel for a week madame rose had enjoyed her cellar to herself her last guest an old and infirm woman having died of old age but since the preceding day she had taken in a new tenant n idiot girl of some fourteen years of age whom her father an inhabitant of the court had lately forsaken and whom society that negligent stepother of man had left to her fate and now with tears of emotion and admiration rachel watched the little frenchwoman feeding her adopted child having first girt its neck with a sort of bib madame rose armed herself with a long handled spoon and standing before it he was too short to sit he deliberately poured a sufficient quantity of onion soup down its throat a proceeding which the idiot girl received with great equanimity opening and shutting her mouth with exemplary regularity and seriousness so absorbed was rachel in looking that she never heard her mother calling her from below until the summons was for a third time angrily repeated now rachel what are you doing up there asked the sharp voice of mrs gray at the foot of the staircase moping as usual eh rachel started and hastened down stairs a little frightened she had remained unusually long what if her mother should suspect that she had gone up for the purpose of thinking mrs gray had no such suspicion fortunately else she would surely have been horrortruck at the monstrous idea that rachel should actually dare to think the very extravagance of the supposition saved rachel it was not to be thought of the candle was lit mrs brown and another neighbour had looked in gossip flavoured with scandal lse it would have been tasteless as at full galop la but didn i always say so exclaimed mrs brown who had always said everything i couldn have believed it that i couldn emphatically observed mrs gray la bless you mrs gray i could sneered the neighbour who was sharp thin and irritable even jane had her word i never liked her she said giving her thread a pull who is she languidly asked mary letting her work fall on her knees never you mind miss tartly replied jane just stitch on will you mrs brown was again down on the unlucky absent one serve her right she said benevolently serve her right he set up thing oh there rachel lawk rachel what a pity you ain been here you never heard such a story as has come out about that little staymaker humpy as i call her why she been a making love to a but i can help laughing when i think of it and it all true every word of it aint it mrs smith mrs smith loftily acquiesced oh my little room y little room inwardly sighed rachel as she sat down to her work she hoped that the story was at least finished and over but if it was the commentaries upon it were only beginning and heaven knows if they were not various and abundant rachel did her best to abstract herself to hear and not listen she succeeded so well that she only awoke from her dream when mrs brown said to her well rachel why don you answer then rachel looked up with a start and said in some trepidation answer i didn hear you speak mam didn you now knowingly observed mrs brown winking on the rest of the company no mam i did not indeed replied rachel earnestly bless the girl said mrs brown laughing outright why you must be growing deaf i hope not said rachel rather perplexed yet perhaps i am for indeed i did not hear you la miss gray don you see they are making fun of you impatiently observed jane why mrs brown hadn been a saying anything at all rachel reddened a little and there was a general laugh at her expense the joke was certainly a witty one but mrs gray who was a touchy woman was not pleased and no sooner were her amiable visitors gone than she gave it to rachel for having been laughed at with insolent rudeness if you were not sich a simpleton she said in great anger people wouldn dare to laugh at you they wouldn take the liberty no one ever laughed at me i can tell you no mrs brown no nor no mrs smith either but you why theyl do anythink to you rachel looked up from her work into her mother face it rose to her lips to say if you were not the first to make little of me would others dare to do so but she remembered her lonely forsaken childhood and bending once more over her task rachel held her peace i want to go to bed peevishly said mary then go my dear gently replied rachel youl spoil that girl observed mrs gray with great asperity she is not strong answered rachel and i promised mr jones she should not work too much not much fear of that drily said jane as the door closed on mary no one answered rachel worked her mother read the paper and for an hour there was deep silence in the parlour as the church clock struck nine a knock came at the door jane opened and a rosy goodumoured looking man entered the parlour he was about forty short stout with rather a low forehead and stubby hair altogether he seemed more remarkable for goodature than for intelligence at once his look went round the room mary is gone to bed mr jones said rachel smiling to bed he ain ill i hope miss gray he exclaimed with an alarmed start ill oh no but she felt tired i am sorry you have had this long walk for nothing never mind miss gray he replied cheerfully then sitting down and wiping his moist brow he added the walk does me good and then i hear how she is and ie the pleasure of seeing you all and so she quite well is she he leaned his two hands on the head of his walkingtick and looking over it smiled abstractedly at his own thoughts mrs gray roused him with the query and what do you think of the state of the nation mr jones mr jones scratched his head looked puzzled hemmed and at length came out with the candid confession mrs gray i ain no politician for all i see politics only brings a poor man into trouble look at the chartists and the tenth of april ah poor things sighed rachel i saw them hey passed by here how thin they were ow careworn they looked mrs gray remained aghast rachel had actually had the audacity to give an opinion on any subject unconnected with dressaking nd even on that poor girl she was not always allowed to speak now rachel she said rallying will you hold your tongue and speak of what you know and not meddle with politics we must apologize for using italics but without their aid we never could convey to our readers a proper idea of the awful solemnity with which mrs gray emphasized her address rachel was rather bewildered for she was not conscious of having said a word on politics a subject she did not understand and never spoke on but she had long learned the virtue of silence she did not reply as to the chartists resumed mrs gray turning to mr jones law bless you mrs gray i ain one of them he hastily replied i mind my own business hat what i do mrs gray the world must go round you know so it must gravely replied that lady you never said a truer thing mr jones and very likely mr jones had not and i must go off said mr jones rising with a halftifled sigh for it getting late and i have five miles to walk and undetained by mrs gray slow but honest entreaty to stay and share their supper he left rachel lighted him out as she closed the parlour door he looked at her and lowering his voice he said hesitatingly i couldn see her could i miss gray poor rachel hesitated she knew that she should get scolded if she complied but then he looked at her with such beseeching eyes e wished for it so very much kindness prevailed over fear she smiled and treading softly led the way uptairs as softly he followed her up into the little back room mary was fast asleep her hands were folded over the coverlet of variegated patchwork her head lay slightly turned on the white pillow the frill of her cap softly shaded her pale young face now slightly flushed with sleep her father bent over her with fond love keeping in his breath rachel held the light she turned her head away that mr jones might not see her eyes fest filling with tears oh my father my father she thought never have you looked so at your child ever ever on tipoe mr jones softly withdrew and stole downstairs i have kissed her he whispered to rachel as she opened the door for him but it might have woke her out of that sweet sleep and away he went happy to have purchased by a ten miles walk after a day hard labour that look at his sleeping child oh lord how beautiful is the love thou hast put into the hearts of thy creature thought rachel gray and though it had not been her lot to win that love the thought was to her so sweet and so lovely that she bore without repining her expected scolding mrs gray had never heard of such a think ever chapter the rich man has his intellect and its pleasures he has his books his studies his club his lectures his excursions he has foreign lands splendid cities galleries museums ancient and modern art the poor man has his child solitary delight of his hard tasked life only solace of his cheerless home richard jones had but that one child that peevish sickly fretful little daughter but she was his all he was twentyne when the grocer in whose shop his youth had been spent died a bankrupt leaving one child a daughter a pale sickly young creature of seventeen called mary smith richard jones had veneration large he had always felt for this young lady an awful degree of respect quite sufficient of itself to preclude love had he been one to know this beautiful feeling by more than hearsay hich he was not indeed he never could or would have thought of mary smith as something less than a goddess if calling at the house of the relative to whom she had gone and finding her in tears and on her own confession very miserable he had not felt moved to offer himself most hesitatingly poor fellow i for her acceptance miss smith gave gracious consent they were married and lived most happily together poor little mary temper was none of the best but richard made every allowance breaking down of the business ther death aving to marry a poor fellow like him in short he proved the most humble and devoted of husbands toiled like a slave to keep his wife like a lady and never forgot the honour she had conferred upon him to this honour mrs jones added after three years by presenting him with a sickly baby which to its mother name of mary proudly added that of its maternal grandfather smith a year after the birth of mary smith jones her mother died the affections of the widower centred on his child he had indeed felt more awe than fondness for his deceased wife ove had never entered his heart he earned it with him pure and virgin to the grave impressed with but one image hat of his daughter he reared his little baby alone and unaided once indeed a female friend insisted on relieving him from the charge but after surrendering his treasure to her after spending a sleepless night he rose with dawn and went and fetched back his darling during his wife lifetime he had been employed in a large warehouse but now in order to stay at home he turned basketaker his child slept with him cradled in his arms he washed combed dressed it himself every morning and made a woman of himself for its sake when mary grew up her father sent her to school and resumed his more profitable outoor occupation after a long search and much deliberation he prenticed her to rachel gray and with her mary jones had now been about a month how pretty she looked with that bit of pink on her cheek soliloquized richard jones as he turned round the corner of the street on his way homewards and fairer than his mistress image to the lover fancy young mary face rose before her father on the gloom of the dark night a woman voice suddenly broke on his reverie she asked him to direct her to the nearest grocer shop i am a stranger to the neighbourhood he replied but i dare say this young person can tell us and he stopped a servantirl and put the question to her a grocer shop she said there not one within a mile you must go down the next street on your rightand turn into the alley on your left then turn to your right again and if you take the fifth street after that it will take you to the teapot she had to repeat her directions twice before the woman fairly understood them what a chance thought jones as he again walked on not a grocer shop within a mile now suppose i had say fifty pounds just to open with how soon the thing would do for itself and then i have my little mary at home with me yes that would be something ay the shop and mary mbition and love ever since he had dealt tea and sugar in mr smith establishment richard jones had been haunted with the desire to become a tradesman and do the same thing in a shop of his own but conscious of the extravagant futility of this wish jones generally consoled himself with the thought that grocer shops were as thick as mushrooms and that capital or no capital there was no room for him and now as he walked home dreaming he could not but sigh for there was room he could not doubt it ut where was the capital he was still vaguely wondering in his own mind by what magical process the said capital could possibly be called up when he reached his own home there he found that in his absence a rudely scrawled scrap of paper had been slipped under his room door it was to the following purport dear j als up farm broke weral inn for it yours s s this laconic epistle signified that the firm in whose warehouse richard jones was employed had stopped payment rich men lost their thousands and eat none the worse a dinner richard jones lost his week wages his future employment and remained stunned with the magnitude of the blow his first thought flew to his child how shall i pay miss gray for my little mary keep he exclaimed inwardly he cast his look round the room to see what he could pledge or sell alas there was little enough there his next feeling was my darling must know nothing about it thank god she is not with me now thank god but though this was some sort of comfort the future still looked so dark and threatening that jones spent a sleepless night tossing in his bed and groaning so loudly that his landlady forsook her couch to knock at his door and inquire to his infinite confusion if mr jones felt poorly and if there was anything she could do for him and if he would like some hot ginger to which mr jones replied with thanks that he was quite well much obliged to her all the same after this significant hint he managed to keep quiet towards morning he fell asleep and dreamed he had found a purse full of guineas and that he was going to open a grocer shop to be called the teapot richard jones was sober intelligent enough for what he had to do and not too intelligent hich is a great disadvantage he bore an excellent character and yet somehow or other when he searched for employment there seemed to be no zoom for him and had he been a philosopher which most fortunately for his peace of mind he was not he must inevitably hare come to the conclusion that in this world he was not wanted we are not called upon to enter into the history of his struggles he maintained a sort of precarious existence now working at this now working at that for he was a jack of all trades and could torn his hand to anything but certain of no continual employment how he went through it all still paying miss gray still keeping up a decent appearance contracting no debts the pitying eye which alone looks down on the bitter trials of the poor also alone knows the poorer a man gets the more he thinks of wealth and money the narrower does the world close around him and all the wider grows the world of his charms the shop which had only been a dormant idea in richard jones mind now became a living phantom day and night mom and noon it haunted him when he had nothing to do nd this was unfortunately too often the case e sought intuitively the suburb where rachel gray dwelt ascertained over and over that within the mile circuit of that central point there did not exist one grocer shop and finally determined that the precise spot where for public benefit and its own advantage a grocer shop should be was just round the corner of the street next to that of rachel gray in a dirty little house now occupied by a rag and bottle establishment with very dirty windows and a shabby black doll dangling like a thief over the doorway spite of which enticing prospect the rag and bottle people seemed to thrive but indifferently if one might judge from the sulky illempered looking woman whom jones always saw within sorting old rags and scowling at him whenever she caught him in the act of peering in it was therefore with no surprise though with some uneasiness that coming one day to linger as usual near the place james found the rag and bottle shop closed the black doll gone and the words to let scrawled in white chalk on the shutters convinced that none but a grocer could take such a desirable shop and desirous at least to know when this fated consummation was to take place jones took courage and went on as far as rachel gray jane the grim apprentice opened to him there no one at home she said mr jones pleaded fatigue and asked to be permitted to rest awhile she did not oppose his entrance but grimly repelled all his attempts at opening a conversation he entered on that most innocent topic the weather and praised it it has been raining was jane emphatic reply oh has it what them bells ringing for i wonder they aint a ringing theye a tolling mr jones rather confused at being thus put down by a girl of sixteen coughed behind his hand and looked round the room for a subject he found none save a general inquiry after the health of mary mrs gray and miss gray theye all well enough disdainfully replied jane oh are they i see the rag and bottle shop is shut he added plunging desperately into the subject sose it is answered jane eyeing him rather defiantly for the rag and bottle woman was her own aunt and she thought the observation of a personal nature though much taken aback jones spurred on by the irresistible wish to know ventured on another question you don know who is going to take it next do you oh you want to take it do you said jane i exclaimed jones flurried and disconcerted la bless the young woman i aint in the rag and bottle line am i he thought by this artful turn to throw his young enemy off the scent but her rejoinder showed him the futility of the attempt i didn say you was did i she replied drily jones rose precipitately and hastily desiring his love to mrs gray and his respects to mary he retreated most shamefully beaten he did not breathe freely until he reached the end of the street and once more found himself opposite the closed rag shop how he had come there he did not rightly know for it was not his way home but being there he naturally gave it another look he stood gazing at it very attentively and absorbed in thought when he was roused by a sharp voice which said paps you like to see it within the voice came from above richard looked up the first floor window was open and a man head was just thrust out of it it looked down at him in the street and apparently belonged to a little old man to whom one very sharp eye he other was closed up quite tight nd a long nose which went all of one side gave a rather remarkable appearance thank you sir replied jones rather confused i before he had got to the end of his speech the old man vanished from the window and suddenly appeared at the private door beckoning him in come in he said coaxingly like an ogre luring in an unwary little boy and drawn as by a magnet jones entered dark passage but good shop said the old man he opened a door and in the shop suddenly stepped richard jones it was small dirty and smelt of grease and old rags good shop said the old man rubbing his hands in seeming great glee neat back parlour he opened a glass door and jones saw a triangular room not much larger than a goodized cupboard more rooms up stairs briskly said the old man he nimbly darted up an old wooden staircase that creaked under him mechanically jones followed there were two rooms on the upper and only storey one of moderate size the other a little larger than the back parlour good shop began the old man reckoning on his fingers caital shop neat parlour ery neat upper storey two rooms one splendid cosy bedoom rent of the whole only thirtyive pounds aear nly thirtyive pounds aear the repetition was uttered impressively thank you uch obliged to you began richard jones wishing himself fairly out of the place but you see stop a bit eagerly interrupted the old man catching jones by the buttonole and fixing him as the ncient mariner fixed the wedding guest with his glittering eye stop a bit you take the house keep shop parlour and bedroom for yourself and family lenty furnish front room let it at five shillings a week fiftywo weeks in the year five times two ten ut down naught carry one five times five twentyive and one twentyix wo hundred and sixty shillings make thirteen pounds take thirteen pounds from thirtyive law bless you sir hastily interrupted jones getting frightened at the practical landlord view the oneyed and oneidedosed old man seemed to take of his presence in the house law bless you sir it all a mistake every bit of it a mistake interrupted the old man his voice rising shrill and loud a mistake five times two ten well but i couldn think of such a thing in his turn interrupted jones i well then say thirty pound pertinaciously resumed the old man take thirteen from thirty no i can then eally i can desperately exclaimed jones on my word i can well then say twentyive from twentyive take thirteen i tell you ain a bit of use your taking away thirteen at that rate interrupted jones rather warmly and what will you give then asked the old man with a sort of screech why nothing impatiently replied jones who ever said i would give anything i didn id i then what do you come creeping and crawling about the place for hissed the old man his one eye glaring defiance on jones eh just tell me that why these two months youe crept and crept and crawled and crawled till youe sent the rag and bottle people away ir says the rag and bottle woman to me ir we can stand it no longer there a man sir and he prowls around the shop sir and he jist looks in and darts off agin and he won buy no rags and he hasn no bottles to sell and my husband and me sir we can stand it hat all well and what have you got to say to that i should like to know jones who never had a very ready tongue and who was quite confounded at the accusation remained dumb il tell you what you are though cried the old man his voice rising still higher with his wrath you are a crawling creeping low sneaking fellow now old gentleman cried jones in his turn losing his temper just keep a civil tongue in your head will you i didn ask to come in did i and if i did look at the shop at times why a cat can look at a king can he spite of the excellence of the reasoning thus popularly expressed jones perceived that the old man was going to renew his offensive language and as he wisely mistrusted his own somewhat hasty temper he prudently walked downstairs and let himself out but then he reached the street the old man head was already out of the firstloor window and jones turned the corner pursued with the words creeping crawling he lost the rest chapter rachel sat alone working and thinking the dull street was silent the sound and stir of morning alive elsewhere reached it not but the sky was clear and blue and on that azure field mounted the burning sun gladdening the very houseoofs as he went and filling with light and life the quiet parlour of rachel gray mrs gray was an ignorant woman and she spoke bad english but her literary tastes were superior to her education and to her language her few books were good hey were priceless they included the poetical works of one john milton whether mrs gray understood him in all his beauty and sublimity we know not but at least she read him seriously conscientiously nd many a fine lady cannot say as much rachel too read milton and loved him as a fine mind must ever love that noble poet that very morning she had been reading one of his sonnets too little read and too little known we will give it here for though of course all our readers are already acquainted with it it might not be present to their memory when i consider how my light is spent ere half my days in this dark world and wide and that one talent which is death to hide lodg with me useless though my soul more bent to serve therewith my maker and present my true account lest he returning chide oth god exact dayabour light denied i fondly ask but patience to prevent that murmur soon replies od doth not need either man work or his own gifts who best bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state is kingly thousands at his bidding speed and post or land and ocean without rest they also serve who only stand and wait hey also serve who only stand and wait thought rachel brooding over the words as was her wont and that is my case oh god i stand and wait and alas i do nothing for i am blind and ignorant and helpless and what am i that the lord should make use of me yet in his goodness my simple readiness to do his will he takes as good service oh rachel happy rachel to serve so kind a master her work dropt on her lap and so deep was her abstraction that she heard not the door opening and saw not richard jones until he stood within a few paces of her chair she gave a slight start on perceiving him and her nervous emotion was not lessened by remarking that he was rather pale and looked excited mary is very well she said hastily and half smiling at the supposed alarm which had she thought brought him so suddenly in upon her of course she is f course she is he replied nodding then drawing a chair near to rachel he sat down upon it and bending forward with his two hands resting on his knees he said in a deep impressive whisper miss gray may i speak to you i want you to advise me he added after a slight pause to advise you mr jones echoed rachel looking up at him with mild astonishment yes miss gray he firmly replied and slightly clearing his throat he thus began miss gray i aint a known you very long but there aint another in this wide world whom i respect as i do you and i think i have proved it for haven i given you my little mary i couldn do more miss gray he added with energetic earnestness yes miss gray i do respect you and that is why i want you to advise me now this is the whole story from a boy miss gray i have wished to be in business i was in business at mr smith mr smith was the grandfather of my little mary but not on my account and that not quite the same thing you see and i have wished to be in the grocery line in particular because of understanding it so much better from having been brought up to it like now miss gray here the plain truth of the case some time ago i found out by chance that there was not ctually that there was not a grocer shop in this immediate vicinity here mr jones held up his forefinger by way of note of admiration well miss gray he resumed impressively that thought haunted me why here was the very place for me a grocer was wanted i found out too that the rag and bottle shop round the corner was just the place for me and the people left too but bless you miss gray was all not a bit of use or why hadn got no capital well miss gray to make a long story short a cousin of mine has just died and left me all she had poor thing and that was sixty pound now miss gray what i want to know is this o you think that as a father hat is the father of my little mary justified in risking that money by setting up a shop or that it my duty to keep it all up for the child he looked earnestly in rachel face ay the child it was still the child and always the child his own was not his own t was but a trust held for his little mary truly mr jones said rachel smiling you can do what you like with your own no indeed miss gray he rejoined a little warmly i must think of my little mary first and you see the whole question is which is best for her why i aint slep these three nights with thinking on it and so at last i thought i come to you who had ever asked rachel for advice rachel the simpleton achel the slighted and laughedt dressmaker little did mr jones know how nervous he made the poor girl besides she felt quite bewildered at the strange views he took of the case he submitted to her at length she gathered courage and looking earnestly in his face with her mild brown eyes she spoke mr jones she said it seems to me that as the money is yours and that as your intentions are to turn it to a good account you have a right to do with it as you please i think too that you are likely to do very well as a grocer for we really do want one about here but i only tell you what i think i do not advise i really cannot if you want advice mr jones why ask it of one who cannot mistake for he is not liable to human error sk it of god almighty richard jones scratched his head then hung it down ashamed if he had dared he would have asked of rachel how he was to ask of god to advise him and especially how he was to get the answer poor fellow he had an excellent hearty some faith much charity but the world net was around him his life was not like that of rachel gray heaven upon earth and rachel who laboured under the disadvantages of a narrow education and a narrow life who had not enough knowledge and enough experience of human nature to understand clearly that there were states of mind worlds lower than her own did not suspect that she had given richard jones the worst of all advice hat which the receiver cannot follow alas who talks of god now who listens like adam in eden to the voice of the lord and treasures in his or her own heart that source of all knowledge and we complain that god goes away from us that his face is dark and behind the cloud that in the days of adversity we find him not jones rose confused muttered thanks then hastily changed the subject by asking to see his daughter even as he spoke the door opened and mary entered she did not show much pleasure or surprise on seeing her father it was not that she did not love him but she was a spoiled child too much accustomed to his fondness and devotion to set great value on either she complained of the heat then of the cold sat down got up again and gave herself all the airs of a precocious woman her father leaning on his stick looked at her with admixing fondness and occasionally nodded and winked at rachel as if inviting her to admire likewise at length with a half stifled sigh or he never parted from his darling without regret e again said he must go and so goodye my little mary he added kissing her but the peevish child halfurned her head away and said his beard hurt her you hear her miss gray he exclaimed chuckling does not care a pin for her old father not a pin and chucking mary chin he looked down at her fondly dear me father how can you asked the young lady rather pettishly upon which mr jones shook his head looked delighted and at length managed to tear himself away and is it thus indeed that fathers love their daughters thought rachel gray as she sat alone in the little back room on the evening of that day and is it thus indeed oh my father y father she laid down the book she had been attempting to read she leaned her brow upon her hand she envied none but her heart felt full to overlowing since the night when she had gone to look at her father as we have recorded rachel had not felt strong or courageous enough to attempt more her nature was timid sensitive and shrinking to a fault and circumstances had made it doubly so yet the repeated sight of richard jones devoted love for his child inspired her with involuntary hope she had grown up in the belief of her father rooted indifference might she not have been mistaken was it not possible that his daughter could become dear to thomas gray as other daughters were dear to their father rachel had always cherished the secret hope that it would one day be so but because that hope was so precious she had deferred risking it lest it should perish irretrievably she now felt inwardly urged to make the attempt why should she not like the prodigal son rise and go to her father i will she thought clasping her hands her cheeks flushing her eyes kindling yes i will go toorrow and my father shall know his daughter and perhaps who knows perhaps god almighty will bless me here the sound of a sudden tumult in the little court close by broke on the dream of rachel gray she looked and she saw and heard madame rose gesticulating and scolding to the infinite amusement of a crowd of boys who where teazing the idiot girl the wrath of madame rose was something to see having first placed her protege behind herself for safety s if her own little body could do much for the protection of another twice its size adame rose next put herself in an attitude then expostulated with then scolded then denounced the persecutors of the helpless idiot after which washing her hands of them she walked backwards to her cellar scorning to turn her back to the foe but the enemy nothing daunted showed evident intentions of besieging her in her stronghold and though madame rose made her appearance at the window armed with a broomstick she failed to strike that terror into the hearts of her assailants which the formidable nature of the weapon warranted fortunately however for the peace of the little french lady that valiant knightrrant of modern times the policeman having made his appearance at the entrance of the court a scutter then a rushing flight were the immediate consequence ignorant of this fact madame rose ascribed the result entirely to her own prowess and in all peace of mind proceeded to cook her supper then followed the little domestic scenes which rachel liked to watch as rachel looked she took a bold resolve and this was to pay madame rose a visit they had met the day before in the street and madame rose had addressed a long and voluble discourse to rachel in french concluding with an invitation to visit her which rachel had understood and smilingly accepted and now was the favourable moment to carry this project into effect from the little room rachel heard mrs brown loud voice below in the parlour mrs gray was fully engaged and not likely to mind her daughter absence unheeded rachel slipped out a few minutes brought her round to the little courts and to the house inhabited by madame rose it was dingy noisy and dirty and as she groped and stumbled down the dark staircase rachel half repented haying come the voice of madame rose directed her to the right door or there were several she knocked gently a shrill entrez which she rightly interpreted as a summons to enter was uttered from within and pushing the door open rachel found herself in the abode and presence of madame rose she was received with a storm of enthusiasm that rather bewildered than pleased her madame rose welcomed her in a torrent of speech with a multiplicity of nods and winks and shrugs and exclamations so novel in the experience of rachel gray that she began to wonder how much truth there might be in the epithet occasionally bestowed on madame rose for first of all she insisted on cooking a dish of onion soup for her expressly a kindness which rachel had all the trouble in the world to resist and next this point settled she was loud and unceasing in the praise of the poor idiot girl who sat mowing in her chair rachel went and sat near her and spoke to her but she only got an unintelligible murmur for a reply madame rose shook her head as much as to say that the attainments of mimi o she called her id not include speech but mimi was very good ery good indeed only she could not talk which was bien dommage added madame rose as had she only been able to speak mimi would certainly have done it charmingly you should see her eating onion soup enthusiastically added madame rose it is beautiful then seeing that rachel was engaged in scrutinizing with a pitying glance the ragged attire of her protege madame rose jealously informed her that as yet the toilette of mimi had been a little neglected certainly but that with time and the help of god added madame rose mimi should want for nothing i have an old dress at home that will just do for her timidly said rachel shall i bring it toorrow night madame rose coughed dubiously he had not understood but a perfect knowledge of the english tongue in all its most delicate intricacies was one of her vanities so bending her head of one side and patting her ear as if to imply that there lay the fault she evidently requested rachel to repeat she did so and this time madame rose caught enough of her meaning to misunderstand her i understand understand she exclaimed triumphantly and settling mimi in her chair she told her to be good for that she was only going to fetch her an elegant dress presented to her by the goodness of mademoiselle and that she would be back in an incredibly short space of time after which exhortation madame rose prepared to accompany rachel in vain poor rachel alarmed at the prospect of her mother anger endeavoured to explain that she would bring the dress madame rose still triumphantly asserting that she understood insisted on going out with her guest and actually walked with her to her very door in great trepidation rachel opened it and unconscious of peril or offence madame rose entered clattering along the passage in her wooden shoes but mrs brown voice was just then at the loudest the noise was not heeded rachel took her uptairs to the little backoom and left her there whilst she looked in the room which she shared with her mother for the dress she wished to give mimi she soon came back with it tied in a parcel and now devoutly wished that she could see madame rose safe out of the place but madame rose was in no mood to go she had recognized the room and window where she so often saw rachel and she intimated as much by a lively pantomime first taking up a book she held it before her pretending to read then she pointed to her forehead to imply that rachel was a thinker and finally to the horror and dismay of rachel madame rose shut her eyes opened her mouth and warbled a sufficiently correct imitation of the old hundredth the window was open and even mrs brown voice could not drown these strange tones they reached the ear of mrs gray and before rachel had fairly recovered from the surprise and alarm into which the musical outburst of madame rose had thrown her her stepother appeared at the door of the little back room and in stern and indignant accents asked to know the meaning of what she heard and saw but before rachel could reply the french costume of madame rose had betrayed her mrs gray was of scotch descent and she had some of the old puritan spirit to which in the course of a long life she had added a plenteous store of stubborn english prejudices madame rose was an idolatrous furriner a french beggar too and that she should have darkened her doors hat she should be familiarly sitting under her roof hattering and singing in a back room with her daughter was an intolerable insult a wrong not to be borne i am amazed at you rachel she said her voice quivering with indignation i am amazed at you how dare you do sich a thing the tones and the attitude of mrs gray were not to be misunderstood nor was little madame rose so dull as to mistake them she saw that her presence was not welcome and with great dignity rose and took her leave crimson with pain and shame rachel followed her out she gave madame rose an humble and imploring glance as they parted at the door as much as to say you know i could not help it but the appeal was not needed to her surprise madame rose remained very goodumoured she even laughed and shrugged her shoulders french fashion and indulged in a variety of pantomimic signs closing with one more intelligible than the rest a significant tap of her forefinger on her brown forehead and by which madame rose plainly intimated it to be her firm conviction that the intellect of mrs gray was unfortunately deranged thus they parted violent were the reproaches with which mrs gray greeted her daughter reappearance she exacted a strict and rigid account of the rise and progress of rachel acquaintance with that mad french beggar was horrortruck on learning that the backoom window had been made the medium and not satisfied with prohibiting future intercourse took the most effective means to prevent it by locking up the guilty zoom and putting the key in her pocket to all this rachel submitted though when she saw the door of her muchoved retreat closing on her her heart ached but when in the height of her anger mrs gray railed at the poor little frenchwoman as little better than an idolater or an infidel rachel felt as if it touched her honour not to suffer this slur on her humble friend mother she said with some firmness you cannot tell what she is for you know nothing of her save by idle reports i have watched her life day after day and i have seen that it is holy and mother added rachel slightly colouring from the fervour with which she felt and spoke you know it as i do all holiness comes from god unable to contradict mrs gray sniffed indignantly chapter hard indeed were the days that followed for rachel gray the old quarrel had began anew why was she not like every one why did she pick up strange acquaintances bove all why did she mope and want to be in the little back room it was strange and mrs gray was not sure that it was not wicked if so it was a wickedness of which she effectually deprived rachel by keeping the back room locked and the key in her pocket but hard as this was it was not all amongst rachel few treasures were little pamphlets tracts old sermons scraps of all sorts a little hoard collected for years but to their owner priceless she did not read them daily she had not time but when she was alone she took them oat now and then to look at and think over on the day that followed the affair of madame rose mrs gray discovered rachel board more of rachel rubbish she thought and she took the papers to the kitchen and lit the fire with them forthwith oh mother what have you done cried rachel when she discovered her loss well what about it tartly asked mrs gray a few silent unheeded tears rachel shed but no more was said but her very heart ached and perhaps because it did ache her longing to go and see her father returned all the stronger the whole day the thought kept her in a dream i never saw you so mopish angrily exclaimed mrs gray never rachel looked up in her mother face and smiled so pleasantly that mrs gray was a little softened she herself knew not why but the smile was so very sweet and again rachel sat up that night when all were sleeping in the little house again she burned her precious candle ends and sat and sewed to finish the last of the halfozen of fine linen shirts begun a year before purchased with the few shillings she could spare now and then from her earnings and sewed by stealth in hours robbed from the rest of the night after the fatigue of the day but spite of all her efforts to keep awake she fell asleep over her task when she awoke daylight gleamed through the chinks of the shutters it was morning she opened the window in some alarm but felt relieved to perceive that it was early yet the street was silent every window was closed the sky still free from smoke was calm and pure there was a peace in this stillness which moved the very heart of rachel gray she thought of the calm slumbers of the two millions who in a few hours would fill the vast city with noise agitation and strife and she half sadly wondered that for the few years man has to spend here below for the few wants and cravings he derives from nature he should think it needful to give away the most precious hours of a short life and devote to ceaseless toil every aspiration and desire of his heart it was too late to think of going to bed which would besides have exposed her to discovery so after uniting her morning and evening prayers in one long and fervent petition of hope and love she went back to her work finished the little there was to do then carefully folded up the six shirts and tied them up in a neat parcel when this was done rachel busied herself with her usual tasks about the house until her mother came down it was no uncommon thing for rachel to get up early and do the work while her mother still slept and accordingly that she should have done so as mrs gray thought drew forth from her no comment on this particular morning everything indeed seemed to favour her project for in the course of the day mrs gray and jane went out rachel remained alone with mary why how merry you are toay miss said mary looking with wonder at rachel as she busied herself about the house singing by snatches it is such a fine day replied rachel she opened the parlour window in poured the joyous sunshine he blue sky shone above the dull brick street and the tailor thrush began to sing in its osier cage a day to make one happy continued rachel and she smiled at her own thoughts for on such a beautiful day how could she but prosper mary she resumed after a pause you will not be afraid if i go out and leave you awhile alone will you la bless you no miss gray said mary smiling are you afraid when you are alone she added with a look of superiority for she too seeing every one else around her do it unconsciously began to patronize rachel oh no simply replied rachel gray too well disciplined into humility to feel offended with the pertness of a child i am never afraid but then i am so much older than you however since you do not mind it i shall go out either jane or my mother will soon be in and so you will not long remain alone at all events la bless you i don mind replied mary again looking superior and now rachel is gone out she has been walking an hour and more again she goes through a populous neighbourhood and through crowded streets but this time in the broad daylight of a lazy summer afternoon rachel is neither nervous nor afraid ot at least of anything around her on she goes her heart full of hope her mind full of dreams on she goes street after street is passed at length is reached the street where thomas gray the father of rachel lives she stops at the secondand ironmonger and looks at the portraits and the books and feels faint and hopeless and almost wishes that her father may not be within thomas gray was at his work and there was a book by him at which he glanced now and then tom paine rights of man there was an empty pewter pot too and a dirty publicouse paper from which we do not mean to have it inferred that thomas gray was given to intoxication he was essentially a sober steady man vehement in nothing not even in politics though he was a thorough republican thomas gray was planing sturdily enjoying the sunshine which fell full on his meagre figure it was hot but as he grew old he grew chilly when suddenly a dark shadow came between him and the light he looked up and saw a woman standing on the threshold of his shop she was young and simply clad tall and slender not handsome and very timid looking walk in mam he said civilly enough the stranger entered he looked at her and she looked at him want anything he asked at length she took courage and spoke my name is rachel she said he said nothing rachel gray she resumed he looked at her steadily but he was still silent i am your daughter she continued in faltering accents well i never said you was not he answered rather drily come you need not shake so there a chair there take it and at down rachel obeyed but she was so agitated that she could not utter one word her father looked at her for awhile then resumed his work rachel did not speak he literally could not words would have choked her so it was thomas gray who opened the conversation well and how the old lady he asked my mother is quite well thank you sir replied rachel the name of father was too strange to be used thus at first and you ow do you get on you e a milliner stayaker in you i am a dressaker but i can do other work said rachel thinking this poor girl a favourable opening for her present i have made these for you she added opening and untying her parcel and displaying the shirts to her father view and as she did so she gazed very wistfully in his face he gave them a careless look why my good girl he said i have dozens of shirts ozens and he returned to his work a moment interrupted tears stood in rachel eyes i am sorry she began but ut i did not know and then i thought i thought you might like them aint of much consequence he philosophically replied thank you all the same jim he added hailing a lad who was passing by just tell them at the ose to send down a pint of halfndalf will you i dare say youl have something before you go he continued addressing his daughter if youl just look in there he added jerking his head towards the back parlour youl find some bread and cheese on the table there a plate too rachel rose and eagerly availed herself of this invitation cold though it was she felt curious too to inspect her father domestic arrangements she was almost disappointed to find everything so much more tidy than she could have imagined she had hoped that her services as houseeeper might be more required either then or at some future period of time she sat down but she could not eat here the halfndalf said her father from the shop rachel went and took it she poured out some in a glass but she could not drink her heart was too full you better said her father who had now joined her i cannot replied rachel feeling ready to cry i am neither hungry nor thirsty thank you oh aint you said her father yet you have a long walk home you know it was the second time he said so rachel looked up into his face she sought for something there not for love not for fondness but for the shadow of kindness for that which might one day become affection he saw nothing but cold hard rooted indifference the head of rachel sank on her bosom the will of god be done she thought with a sigh she rose and looked up in her father face good bye father she said for her father she would call him once at least good bye rachel he replied she held out her hand he took it with the same hard indifference he had shown from the beginning he did not seek to detain her he did not ask her to come again his farewell was as cold as had been his greeting rachel left him with a heart full to bursting she had not gone ten steps when he called her she hastened back he stood on the threshold of his shop a newspaper in his hand just take that paper and leave it at the ose will you you can miss the ose t the publicouse round the leftand corner yes father meekly said rachel she took the paper from his hand turned away and did as she was bid her errand fulfilled rachel walked home there were no tears on her cheek but there was a dull pain at her heart an aching sorrow that dwelt there and that o what she would ould not depart in vain she said to herself it was just what i expected of course i could not think it would come all in a day besides if it be the will of god must i not submit still disappointment murmured oh but it is hard not one word not one look not one wish to see me again nothing othing it was late when rachel reached home mrs gray confounded at her stepaughter audacity in thus again absenting herself without leave had during the whole day amassed a store of resentment which now burst forth on rachel head the irritable old lady scolded herself into a violent passion rachel received her reproaches with more of apathy than of her usual resignation they were alone jane and mary had retired to their room rachel sat by the table where the supper things were laid her head supported by her hand at the other end of the table sat mrs gray erect sharp bitter scolding and railing by turns and between both burned a yellow tallow candle unsnuffed dreary looking and but half lighting the gloomy little parlour and so you won say where you have been you goodorothing creature at length cried mrs gray exasperated by her daughter long silence rachel looked up in her stepother face you did not ask me where i had been she said deliberately i have been to see my father not one word could mrs gray utter the face of rachel pale desolate and sorrowtricken told the whole story rachel added nothing she lit another candle and merely saying in her gentle voice good night mother she left the room as rachel passed by the little room of the apprentices she saw a streak of light gliding out on the landing through the halfpen door she pushed it and entered jane sat reading by the little table mary lay in bed but awake i did not know you were up said rachel to jane and seeing a light i felt afraid of fire not much fear of fire drily answered jane rachel did not heed her she was bending over mary how are you toight mary she asked oh i am quite well pettishly answered mary rachel smoothed the young girl hair away from her cheek she remembered how dearly how fondly loved was that peevish child and she may be forgiven if she involuntarily thought the contrast between that love and her own portion of indifference bitter mary she softly whispered did you say your prayers toight why of course i did and mary did you pray for your father i wish you would let me sleep crossly said the young girl oh mary ary exclaimed rachel and there was tenderness and pathos in her voice mary i hope you love your father hope you love him who said i didn ah but i fear you do not love him as much as he loves you to be sure i don replied mary who had grown up in the firm conviction that children were domestic idols of which fathers were the born worshippers but you must try ut you must try very earnestly said rachel promise me that you will try mary she spoke in a soft low voice but mary wearied with the discourse turned her head away i can talk my back aches she said peevishly mary back always aches when she don want to speak ironically observed jane you mind your own business will you cried mary reddening and speaking very fast i don want your opinion at all events and if i did i thought you couldn talk your back ached so quietly put in jane mary burst into peevish tears jane laughed triumphantly rachel looked at them both with mild reproach jane she said it is wrong ery wrong o provoke another mary god did not give us tears nd they are a great gift of his mercy o shed them so for a trifle do it no more the two girls remained abashed rachel quietly left the room she went to her own she had prayed long that morning but still longer did she pray that night for alas ho knows it not he wings of hope would of themselves raise us to heaven but hard it is for poor resignation to look up from this sad earth chapter we were made to endure a heathen philosopher held the eight of the just man suffering worthy of the gods and christianity knows nothing more beautiful more holy than the calm resignation of the pure and the lowly to the will of their divine father it was the will of heaven that rachel should not be beloved of her earthly father she bore her lot ot without sorrow but at least without repining perhaps she was more silent more thoughtful than before but she was not less cheerful and in one sense she was certainly not less happy affliction patiently borne for the love of the hand that inflicts it loses half its sting the cup is always bitter nd doubly bitter shall it seem to us if we drink it reluctantly but if we courageously dram it we shall find that the last drop is not like the rest it is fraught with a divine sweetness t is a precious balsam and can heal the deepest and most envenomed wound this pure drop rachel found in her cup it strengthened and upheld her through her trial it is the will of god she repeated to herself it is the will of god and those simple words which held a meaning so deep were to rachel fortitude and consolation and in the meanwhile the little world around her unconscious of her sufferings and her trials or even her mother could not wholly divine them ent on its ways mrs gray grumbled jane was grim mary was peevish and mrs brown occasionally dropped in to keep them going as she said herself as to richard jones we will not attempt to describe the uneasiness of mind he endured in endeavouring to follow out rachel advice he did not understand its spirit which indeed she could not have explained they who make the will of god their daily law are guided even in apparently worldly matters ot indeed so as never to commit mistakes which were being beyond humanity but so at least as to err as little as possible concerning their true motives of action our passions are our curse spiritual and temporal and the mere habit of subduing them gives prudence and humility in all things isdom thus becomes one of the rewards which god grants to the faithful servant but of this what did richard jones he most unspiritual of good men know after three days spent in a state of distracting doubt he came to the conclusion that it was and must be the will of heaven that he should have a shop poor fellow if he took his own will for that of the almighty did he fall into a very uncommon mistake once his mind was made up he turned desperate went and secured the shop he had all the time been in a perfect fever lest some other should forestall him after which he became calm did not much care about miss gray opinion id not see why he should care about any one opinion and in this lofty mood it was that richard jones went and gave a loud clear and distinct knock at mrs gray door dinner was over he apprentices were working achel was dreaming rather sadly poor girl for she thought of what was and of what might have been mrs gray was reading the newspaper when the entrance of richard jones admitted by his daughter disturbed the quiet little household at once mrs gray flew into politics well mr jones she cried and how are you i suppose you know they are raising the taxes nd then such rates as we have mr jones uch rates mrs gray was habitually a tory and not a mild one but on the subject of taxes and rates mrs gray was we are sorry to say a violent radical she couldn abide them she declared and so they axe raising the taxes are they echoed mr jones chuckling eh but that won do for me mrs gray i turning householder nd hard by here too he added winking mrs gray did not understand at all she coughed and looked puzzled mr jones saw that rachel had not spoken to her he continued winking chuckling and rubbing his hands as he spoke i am going into business mrs gray mrs gray was profoundly astonished mary work dropped on her lap as she stared with open mouth and eyes at her father who chucked her chin for her yes he resumed addressing mrs gray i had always a turn that way oh you had always mrs gray but i hadn got no capital and for a man to go into business without capital why mam it like a body that aint got no soul don talk so mr jones said mrs gray to whom the latter proposition sounded atheistical don well but what a man without capital asked mr jones unconscious of his offence why nothink mrs gray nothink well but that not the question e got capital now you see and so i am going to set up a grocery business in the rag and bottle shop round the corner and i hare called to secure your custom hat all mrs gray he winked and chuckled again rachel could not help smiling mrs gray was grave and courteous like any foreign potentate congratulating his dear brother monsieur mon frere on some fortunate event of his reign i called to tell you that mrs gray resumed jones and also to ask a favour of miss gray i should be so much obliged to er if she could spare my little mary for half an hour or so just to look over the house with me of course she can replied mrs gray for her meek daughter go and put on your bonnet mary mary whom the tidings of the grocer shop had most agreeably excited rose with great alacrity to obey and promptly returned with her bonnet on it was rachel who let them out you need not be in a hurry to come back dear she whispered there not more work than jane and i can well manage mary only reply to this kind speech was a saucy toss of the head the little thing already felt an heiress how much money have you got father she promptly asked as they went down the street sixty pounds my dear law that ain much said mary as if she had rolled in guineas all her life well it isn he replied candidly and exactly in the same spirit for if there is a thing people promptly get used to it is money mary had always been her father confidante he now opened his whole heart to her and was thereby much relieved to his great satisfaction mary condescended to approve almost without restriction all he had done she accompanied him over the house and shop hought the whole concern rather dirty but kindly added that when it was cleaned up a bit it would do and finally gave it as her opinion that there wasn a better position in the whole neighbourhood of course there ain said mr jones sitting down on the counter the goodwives must either buy from me or walk a mile now it stands to reason that rather than walk a mile with babies crying at home and husbands growling t stands to reason i say that theyl buy from me don it mary of course it does well that ain all you see i know something of business the interest of capital in business ranges from ten to a hundred per cent according to luck now i am lucky being alone so wel say fifty per cent which is moderate ain it mary of course it is replied that infallible authority well then capital sixty pounds interest fifty per cent why in no time like i shall double my capital and when it doubled i shall double it again nd so il go on doubling and doubling until i tired nd then wel stop won we mary the little thing laughed her father gave her a kiss got up from the counter and with the golden vision of endless doubling of capital before him walked out of the shop chapter what airs little mary took how jane taunted and twitted her how rachel had to interfere how even mrs brown chose to comment on the startling fact of a new grocer shop and what predictions she made we leave to the imagination of the reader we deal with the great day or rather with the eve of the great day it was come rachel her mother mary and mr jones were all busy giving the shop its last finishing touch on the next morning the teapot was to open well miss gray ain amiss is it said jones looking around him with innocent satisfaction he was as we have said before a sort of jackfllrades and to him the teapot doubly owed its existence he had painted the walls he had fixed up the shelves in their places the drawers and boxes his own hands had fashioned we will not aver that a professional glazier and carpenter might not have done all this infinitely better than richard jones but who could have worked so cheap or pleased richard jones so well and thus with harmless pleasure he could look around him and repeat well miss gray ain amiss is it amiss put in mrs gray before her daughter could speak i should think not youe a clever man mr jones to have done all that with your own hands out of your own head mr jones rubbed his forehead and passed his hand through his stubby hair well mam ain amiss though i say it that shouldn and though ain much not much father zealously cried mary not relishing so much modesty why didn you nail them shelves with your own hands well child candidly replied her father i think i may say i did and didn you make all them square boxes a whole dozen of them hold your tongue you little chit and help miss gray there to put up the jams and marmalades and didn you paint the walls triumphantly exclaimed mary without heeding his orders who else did i should like to know and the counter who made the counter not i mary i only polished it up well but what was it before you polished it up father asked the pertinacious daughter not much to speak of that the truth why bless you mrs gray he added turning confidentially towards her you never saw such a poor object as that counter was in all your born days it caught my eye at the corner of one of them secondand shops in the new cut the man was standing at the door whistling with his hands in his pockets hat fireood says i to him o ain it as good a counter as ever a sovereign was changed on y good man says i t firewood and il give you five shillings for it law but you should have seen how he looked at me well to cut a long story short he swore it was a counter and i swore it was firewood and so at length i give him ten shillings for it and brought it home and cleaned it down and scraped the dirt inch thick off and washed it and painted it and polished it and look at it now mrs gray look at it now it just like mahogany enthusiastically cried mary ain it miss gray not quite dear mildly said rachel who was truth itself but it looks very nice but mr jones she added in a low timid voice why did you tell the man it was firewood when you meant it as a counter jones wagged his head winked and touching his nose with his right hand forefinger he whispered knowingly that was business miss gray and in business you know em but the teapot father cried mary where the teapot why here the teaot exclaimed jones suddenly producing this masterpiece of art and holding it up aloft to the gaze of the beholders such a teapot had never been seen before and most probably will never be seen again to the end of time its shape we will not because we cannot describe it confounded rachel and startled even mrs gray she coughed and looked at it dubiously where the lid she said why here the lid but it don take off you know oh i see and that the handle the handle bless you mrs gray it the spout well but where the handle then why here the handle to be sure replied jones rather nettled don you see mrs gray said she did but we are inclined to believe she did not however jones was satisfied and setting down the wooden teapot e forgot to say that it was flaming red n the counter he surveyed it complacently i spent a week on that teapot he said didn i mary ten days father well one must not grudge time or trouble must one mrs gray and now ladies wel put away the teapot and step into the parlour and have a cup of tea eh with the cup of tea came a discussion of the morrow prospects and of the ultimate destinies of the teapot he upshot of which was that mr jones was an enterprising public man and destined to effect a salutary revolution in the whole neighbourhood such at least was the opinion of mrs gray warmly supported by mary mr jones was silent through modesty rachel because she was already thinking of other things they parted late though the teapot was to open early there is a report that it opened with dawn mr jones not having been able to shut his eyes all night for excitement but it is more important to record that until its close late on the following evening the teapot was not one moment empty mary had remained at home to assist her father and she went through the day with perfect composure but mr jones was fairly overpowered the cup of his honours was too full the sum of his joy was too great he blundered he stammered he was excited and looked foolish altogether he did not feel happy until the shop was shut and all was fairly over he then sat down wiped his forehead and declared that since he was married to his dear little mary blessed mother he had never gone through such a trying day ever it a fine thing mr jones has undertaken gravely observed mrs gray to mrs brown but mrs brown was inclined to look at the shady side of the teaot la bless you she kindly said itl never do i said so from the first and i say so the last itl never do oh yes it will grimly observed jane it will do for mr jones mrs brown i hope not jane said rachel gravely and i would rather she added with some firmness and venturing for once on a reproof i would rather you did not think so much of what evil may happen to others sufficient to any of us is it to look forward to our own share of evil days she raised her voice as she began but it sank low ere she concluded surprised at herself for having said so much she did not look round but resumed her work a moment interrupted the room remained deeply silent jane was crimson for once mrs gray thought her daughter had spoken sensibly and for once mrs brown found nothing to say chapter a week had passed over the teapot and sitting in the backarlour with mary who was busy sewing richard jones dived deep into his books and cast up his accounts he allowed for rent for expenditure for household for extras then his face brimful of illisguised exultation he said to his daughter well mary dear aint much to boast of but for a first week you see aint amiss either i find all expenses covered one pound ten net profit now you know that makes first fiftywo pound aear then half of fiftywo twentyix add twentyix to fiftywo seventyight eventyight pound aear netrofit well it stands to reason and common sense that as i go on my business will go on improving too in short put it at the lowest hate exaggeration ell put it at the lowest and i may say that by next michaelmas we shall have a neat hundred law father can you say a hundred and fifty at once peevishly interrupted mary mary will was law well i really think i can say a hundred and fifty ingenuously replied richard jones now with a hundred and fifty pound for the first year and just five per cent as increase of profit for the second i sure itl be ten per cent again interrupted mary who from hearing her father had caught up some of the money terms of this moneyaking world well i should not wonder if it would not replied her docile papa wel suppose it at least well that be fifteen pound to add to the hundred and fifty or rather to the three hundred and then for the next year it would be et me see ah and he scratched his head i think i am getting into what they call compound interest and to say the truth i never was a very quick arithmetician at all events it is pretty clear that at the end of ten years we shall stand at the head of something like fifteen hundred pound and a flourishing house of business he added glancing towards the shop a flourishing house of business he continued complacently passing his angers through his hair awhile he mused then suddenly he observed mary my dear hadn you better go to bed mary now slept at home you have to get up early you know yes but i ain going to she tartly replied it gives me a pain in my side she added then you shall not get up early authoritatively said mr jones il not allow my daughter to work herself to death for no miss grays i don think i shall go at all toorrow composedly resumed mary i don like dressaking t don agree with me mr jones had at first looked startled but this settled the question if dressaking don agree with you not another stitch shall you put in he said half angrily i think myself you don look half so well as you used to and though miss gray is as nice a person as one need wish to meet i think she might have perceived it before this but interest blinds us all very one of us he added with a philosophic sigh over the weaknesses of humanity i know what jane will be sure to say observed mary but i don care i should think not law bless you child i have got quite beyond troubling my poor brains with what other people thinks and if i choose to keep my daughter at home now that i can afford to do so why shouldn i it a hard case if when a man well off and comfortable and getting on better and better every day t a hard case indeed if he can keep his only child with him this matter decided mary went up to her room her father remained by the fireside looking at the glowing coals and dreaming to his heart content if i go on prospering so he thought why should i not take n time of course ome smart young fellow to help me in the shop it stands to reason that customers like to be served quickly law bless you they hate waiting he added thoughtfully addressing the fire and giving it a poke by way of comment the ladies always hate it but as i was saying why shouldn i take some smart young man and he of course why i know what he do hy he fall in love with mary of course and why shouldn he inquired jones warming with his subject was i not a poor fellow once and did i not marry my master daughter mr jones gave the fire another poke in the burning coals he saw a pleasing vision rise he saw his shop full of customers he served with slow dignity assisted by a tight brisk young fellow busy as a bee active as a deer for it was saturday night and the fair maids and matrons of the vicinity were all impatient then from saturday it was sunday the shop was closed the street was silent young thomson was brushing his coat in the yard and whistling mary was upstairs dressing another five minutes and she comes down in straw bonnet lined with pink clean printed muslin frock mousselineeaine shawl brown boots and blue parasol the happy father saw them going off together with delighted eyes and brimful heart then other visions follow one of a wedding breakfast at which mr jones sings a song and another of half a dozen grandchildren all tugging at his skirts whilst he solemnly rocks the baby and as solemnly informs the infant that he had done as much for its mother once peace be with such dreams whenever they come to the poor man hearth a little surprised at not seeing mary as usual on the following morning and thinking she might be unwell rachel gray sent jane to enquire jane soon returned her face brimful of news well said rachel how is mary law bless you miss mary well enough why did she not come then she does not like dressaking no more and jane sat down and took up her work and became deeply absorbed in a sleeve trimming rachel reddened and looked pained she liked mary the pale sickly child reminded her strongly of her own lost sister and though she could allow for the natural tartness with which jane had no doubt fulfilled her errand yet she knew that jane was true and that as she represented it the matter must be for a while she suspended her work sadly wondering at the causeless ingratitude of a child whom she had treated with uniform kindness and indulgence then she tried to dismiss the matter from her mind but she could not do so and when dusk came round her first act as soon as she laid by her work was to slip out unperceived or mrs gray highly indignant with mr jones and his daughter would certainly have opposed her nd go as far as the teapot mr jones was serving a customer he did not recognize rachel as she entered the shop and hastily called out mary ary come and serve the lady it only me mr jones timidly said rachel walk in miss gray he replied slightly embarrassed walk in youl find mary in the back parlour very glad to see you miss gray much more sulky than glad looked mary but of this rachel took no notice she sat down by the side of the young girl and as if nothing had occurred spoke of the teapot and its prospects to which discourse mary gave replies pertinaciously sullen mary at length said rachel why did you not come to work to day were you unwell this simple question obtaining no reply rachel repeated it still mary remained silent but when a third time rachel gently said mary what was it ailed you mary began to cry well well what the matter exclaimed her father looking in you ain been scolding my little mary have you miss gray i said rachel no mr jones i only asked her why she did not come this morning because i would not let her he replied almost sharply dressaking don agree with my mary miss gray and you know i told you from the first that if her health wouldn allow it she was not to stay and a customer calling him back to the shop he left the parlour threshold rachel rose goodight mary she gently said if you feel stronger and more able to work you may come back to me mary did not reply goodight mr jones said rachel passing through the shop goodight miss gray he replied formally my best respects to mrs gray if you please when people have done an insolent and ungrateful thing they generally try to persuade themselves that it was a spirited independent sort of thing and so now endeavoured to think richard jones and his daughter but in vain to both still came the thought was this the return to make to rachel gray for all her kindness the conscience of mr jones little used to such reflections made him feel extremely uneasy and if that of mary was not quite so sensitive the dull routine of the paternal home added much force to the conclusion that she had much better have stayed with miss gray mary was too childish and had ever been too much indulged to care for consistency at the close of a week she therefore declared that she wished to go back to miss gray and did not know why her father had taken her away i y dear said richard jones confounded at the accusation you said getting up early made your side ache so it did but i could have got up late and gone all the same only you wouldn let me you kept me here to mind the shop i hate the shop teapot and all added mary busting into tears jones hung down his head hen shook it oh my little mary y little mary he exclaimed ruefully and he felt as if he could hare cried himself to see the strange perversity of this spoiled child who turned upon him as he internally phrased it and actually upbraided him with his overndulgence a wiser father would never have thus indulged a pettish daughter and never have humbled himself as to please his little mary richard jones now did that same day he went round to rachel gray he had hoped that she might be alone in the little parlour but no there sat as if to increase his mortification mrs gray stiff and stern and jane smiling grimly rachel alone was the same as usual jones scratched his head coughed and looked foolish but at length he came out with it would miss gray take back his daughter whose health a week rest had much improved uch improved he added looking at rachel doubtfully mrs gray drew herself up to utter a stern no but for once the mild rachel checked and contradicted her mother and said yes mr jones with great pleasure you may send her toay if you like she has missed us and we have missed her thank you miss gray hank you said jones hurriedly rising to leave give mary my kind love whispered rachel as she let him out but jones had not heard her very slowly and with his hands in his pockets he walked down the street he had not grown tired of mary company why had mary grown tired of his it natural i suppose he thought it natural and when he entered the shop where mary sat sulking behind the counter and he told her that she might go back to miss gray and when he saw her face light up with pleasure he forgot that though natural it was not pleasant you may go toay he added smiling at once mary flew upstairs to her room in less than five minutes she was down again and merely nodding to her father as she passed through the shop off she went with the light happy step of youth it natural he thought again it very natural but he sighed mrs gray took in high dudgeon the consent her daughter had given to the return of mary jones she scarcely looked at that young lady the whole day and when she was gone and jane had retired to her little room and mother and daughter sat together rachel got a lecture you have no spirit indignantly said mrs gray what after the little hussy behaving so shamefully you take her back for the asking she is but a child gently observed rachel but her father ain a child is he rachel smiled indeed mother he is not much better she replied i tell you that you ain got a bit of spirit angrily resumed mrs gray the little imperent hussy to think of playing her tricks here and do you think i agoing to stand that added mrs gray warming with her subject no that i ain see if i don turn her out of doors toorrow morning oh mother mother do not cried rachel alarmed at the threat think that she is but a child after all and oh mother she added with a sigh have you never noticed how like she is to what our own little jane once was mrs gray remained mute she looked back in the past for the image of her lost child she saw a pale face with blue eyes and fair hair like mary never before had the resemblance struck her when it came it acted with overpowering force on a nature which though rugged and stern and embittered by age and sorrows was neither cold nor forgetful one solitary love but ardent and impassioned had sarah gray known in her life of threecore and ten he love of a harsh but devoted mother for an only child for that child sake had its father whom she had married more for prudential reasons than for motives of affection become dear to her heart he was the father of her jane for that child sake had she without repining borne the burden of rachel rachel was the sister of her jane never should rachel want whilst she had heart and hands to work and earn her a bit of bread but when this muchoved child after ripening to early youth withered and dropped from the tree of life when she was laid to sleep in a premature grave all trace of the holy and beautiful tenderness which gives its grace to womanhood seemed to pass away from the bereaved mother heart she became more harsh more morose than she had ever been and had it been worth the world while to note or record it of her too it might have been said as it was of england childless king that from one sad day she smiled no more and now when she heard rachel when in her mind she compared the living with the dead strength pride fortitude forsook her her stern features worked her aged bosom heaved passionate tears flowed down her wrinkled cheek oh my darling y lost darling she cried in broken accents would i could have died for thee would thou wert here toay would my old bones filled thy young grave and she threw her apron over her face and moaned with bitterness and anguish mother dear mother do not pray do not cried rachel distressed and alarmed at so unusual a burst of emotion after a while mrs gray unveiled her face it was pale and agitated but her tears had ceased for years they had not flowed and until her dying day they flowed no more rachel she said looking in her stepaughter face i forgive you you have nearly broken my heart let mary come stay and go but talk to me no more of the dead rachel when my darling died here her pale lips quivered know that i rebelled against the lord now that i did not give her up willingly but only after such agony of mind and heart as a mother goes through when she sees the child she has borne reared cherished fondled lying a pale cold bit of earth before her and therefore i say talk no more to me about the dead lest my rebellious heart should rise again and cry out to its maker h god oh god why didst thou take her from me mrs gray rose to leave the room on the threshold she turned back to say in a low sad voice the child may come toorrow rachel chapter mrs gray had never cared about mary jones she had always thought her what she was indeed sickly and peevish child but now her heart yearned towards the young girl she herself would have been loth to confess why mary took it as a matter of course jane wondered rachel well knew what had wrought such a change but she said nothing and watched silently in softened tones mrs gray now addressed the young girl if rachel ventured to chide mary though ever so slightly her stepother sharply checked her let the child alone were her mildest words as to jane or mrs brown they both soon learned that mary jones was not to be looked at with impunity mrs gray wondered at them she did for teazing the poor little thing in short mary was exalted to the post of favourite to the ruling powers and she filled it with dignity and consequence but the watchful eye of rachel gray noted other signs she saw with silent uneasiness the fading eye the faltering step the weakness daily increasing of her stepother and she felt with secret sorrow that she was soon to lose this harsh yet not unloving or unloved companion of her quiet life mrs gray complained one day of feeling weak and ailing she felt worse the next day and still worse on the third and thus day by day she slowly declined without hope of recovery mrs gray had a strong though narrow mind and a courageous heart she heard the doctor sentence calmly and firmly and virtues which she had neglected in life graced and adorned her last hours and her dying bed meek and patient she bore suffering and disease without repining or complaint and granted herself but one indulgence the sight and presence of mary the young girl was kinder and more attentive to her old friend than might have been expected from her pettish indulged nature she took a sort of pride in keeping mrs gray company in seeing to mrs gray as she called it her little vanity was gratified in having the once redoubtable mrs gray now wholly in her hands and in some sort a helpless dependent on her goodill and kindness it may be too that she found a not unworthy satisfaction in feeling and proving to the little world around her that she also was a person of weight and consequence but her childish kindness availed not the time of mrs gray had come she too was to depart from a world where toil and few joys and some heavy sorrows had been her portion mary and rachel were alone with her in that hour mary was busy about the room rachel sat by her mother bed pale and languid mrs gray turned to her stepaughter and gathering her remaining strength to speak she said feebly my poor rachel i am afraid i have often teazed and tormented you it was all temper but i never meant it unkindly ever indeed and then you see rachel she added true to her old spirit of patronizing and misunderstanding her stepaughter your not being exactly like others provoked me at times but i know it shouldn t wasn fair to you poor girl for of course you couldn help it and rachel true to her spirit of humble submission only smiled and kissed her mother wasted cheek and said meekly do not think of it dear mother o not you were not to blame and she did not murmur even in her heart she did not find it hard that to the end she should be slighted and held as one of little worth a little while after this mrs gray spoke again where is mary she said and here i am mrs gray said mary coming up to her on the other side of the bed mrs gray smiled and stretched out her trembling hands until they met and clasped those of the young girl then with her fading eyes fixed on mary face she said to rachel rachel tell your father that i forgive him will you yes mother replied rachel in a low tone rachel she said again and her weak voice rose rachel you have been a good and a faithful daughter to me ay the lord bless you tears streamed down rachel face on hearing those few words that paid her for many a bitter hour but her mother saw them not still her look sought mary in thy hands lord i commend my spirit she murmured and with her look still fastened on little mary pale face she died sad and empty seemed the house to rachel gray when her mother was gone she missed her chiding voice her step heavy with age her very scolding which long habit had made light to bear the solitude and liberty once so dear and so hardly won now became painful and oppressive but rachel was not long troubled with either we are told that he whom he loveth he chasteneth and rachel was not unloved for she too was to have her share of affliction spite her sickly aspect she enjoyed good health and therefore when she rose one morning shortly after her mother death and felt unusually languid and unwell rachel was more surprised than alarmed la miss how poorly you do look exclaimed jane laying down her work with concern i do not feel very well replied rachel calmly but i do not feel very ill either she added smiling her looks belied her words vainly she endeavoured to work by the united entreaties of jane and mary she was at length persuaded to go up to her room she laid down on her bed and tried to sleep but could not she thought of her stepother so harsh yet so kind in her very harshness of her father so cold and unloving of her silent lonely life and its narrow cares and narrow duties above which smiled so heavenly a hope burning like a clear star above a dark and rugged valley and with these thoughts and feelings heightening them to intensity blended the heat and languor of growing fever when mary came up to know if rachel gray wanted anything she found her so ill that she could scarcely answer her question she grew rapidly worse the medical man who was called in pronounced her disease a slow fever not dangerous but wasting then there is nothing for it but patience resignedly said rachel i fear i shall be the cause of trouble to those around me but the will of god be done la miss wel take care of you zealously said jane shan we mary of course we will as zealously replied the young girl rachel smiled at their earnestness but their zeal was destined to be thrown in the shade by that of a third individual on the fourth day of her illness rachel was awakened from a heavy sleep into which she had fallen by the sound of angry though subdued voices on the staircase i tell you aint a bit of use and that youe not going to go up said the deep emphatic tones of jane et je vous dis que je veux monter moi obstinately exclaimed the shrill french voice of madame rose jane who was not patient now apparently resorted to that last argument of kings and nations physical force to remove the intruder for there was the sound of a scuffle on the staircase but if she had strength on her side madame rose had agility and though somewhat ruffled and out of breath she victoriously burst into rachel room take care miss take care screamed jane rushing up after her the french madwoman has got in and i couldn keep her out don be afraid jane said rachel as the alarmed apprentice made her appearance at the door i am very glad to see madame rose i tell you she will not hurt me and that i am glad to see her she added as jane stared grimly at the intruder she spoke so positively that the apprentice retired but not without emphatically intimating that she should be within call if miss gray wanted her rachel was too ill to speak much but madame rose spared her the trouble by taking that task on herself indeed she seemed willing to take a great deal on herself and listless as rachel was she perceived with surprise that madame rose was in some measure taking possession of her sick room she inquired after mimi madame rose shook her head produced a square pocketandkerchief applied it to her eyes then turned them up till the whites alone were visible in short she plainly intimated that mimi had gone to her last home after which she promptly dried her tears and partly by speech partly by pantomime she informed rachel that the apprentices were too busy sewing to be able to attend on her and that she adame rose ould undertake that care rachel was too ill and languid to resist and jane and mary though they resented the intrusion of the foreigner were unable to eject her for by possession which is acknowledged to be nineenths of the law madame rose made her claim good until the enemy had abandoned all idea of resistance and a devoted nurse she made ever attentive ever vigilant for three months did rachel see in her darkened room the active little figure of the frenchwoman either moving briskly about or sitting erect in her chair knitting assiduously occasionally relieved it is true by jane and mary she saw it when she lay in the trance of fever and pain unable to move or speak in her few moments of languid relief it was still there and it became so linked in her mind with her sick room that when she awoke one day free from fever the delightful sensation that pain was gone from her like the weary dream of a troubled night fled in the morning blended with a sense of surprise and annoyance at missing the nod and the smile of madame rose rachel looked around her wondering and in looking she caught sight of the portly and vulgar figure of mrs brown she saw her with some surprise for she knew that that lady entertained a strong horror of a sick room it only me said mrs brown nodding at her you are all right now my girl i feel much better indeed replied rachel of course you do the fever is all gone otherwise you should not see me here i promise you added mrs brown with another nod and a knowing wink and madame rose said rachel where is madame rose law don trouble your mind about her keep quiet will you mrs brown spoke impatiently rachel felt too weak to dispute her authority but when jane came up she again inquired after madame rose jane drily said it was all right and that miss gray was to keep quiet and more than this she would not say the fever had left rachel she was now cured and rapidly got better but still she did not see madame rose and was favoured with more of mrs brown company than she liked at length she one day positively exacted an explanation from jane who reluctantly gave it law bless you miss she said tain worth talking about mrs brown can abide the little frenchwoman and so one day when she went out she locked the door and wouldn let mary open it and when madame rose rang and rapped mrs brown put her head out of the window and railed at her until she fairly scared her away from the place but what brought mrs brown here asked rachel who had heard her with much surprise jane looked embarrassed but was spared the trouble of replying by the voice of mrs brown who imperatively summoned her downstairs she immediately complied and left rachel alone a mild sun shone in through the open window on the sick girl she had that day got up for the first time and sat in a chair with a book on her knees but she could not read she felt too happy blest in that delightful sense of returning health which long sickness renders so sweet her whole soul overflowed with joy thankfulness and prayer and for once the shadow of sad or subduing thoughts fell not on her joy well my girl and how are you toay said the rough voice of mrs brown who entered without the ceremony of knocking rachel quietly replied that she felt well lmost quite well of course you do i knew i bring you round said mrs brown la bless you all their coddling was just killing you so i told jane all along but she wouldn believe me a bless you girl i said to her do it willingly but ifs only just a wasting of my money says i your money mrs brown interrupted rachel with a start why of course my money whose else didn you know of it indeed i did not replied rachel confounded la what a muff the girl is goodumouredly observed mrs brown and where did you think stupid that the money you have been nursed with these three months came from why from my pocket of course twenty pound threendix besides a quarter rent and another running on rachel was dismayed at the amount of the debt when and how should she be able to pay so large a sum still rallying from her first feeling of surprise and dismay she attempted to express to mrs brown her gratitude for the assistance so generously yielded and her hope of being able to repay it some day but mrs brown would not hear her nonsense rachel she said i ain aone more than i ought to have done for my cousin stepaughter and to whom should jane when she wanted money have come but to me and as to paying me bless you there no hurry rachel i can afford thank heaven to lend twenty pound and not miss it this was kindness uch rachel felt it to be but alas she also felt that these was on her from that day the badge of obligation and servitude she was still too weak to work she had dining her long illness lost the best part of her customers until her full recovery she was perforce cast on mrs brown for assistance and of all persons mrs brown was the last not to take advantage of such a state of things mrs brown came when she liked said what she liked and did what she liked in rachel house but indeed it was not rachel house t was mrs brown rachel was there on sufferance the very bed on which she slept was mrs brown the very chair on which she sat was mrs brown so mrs brown felt and made every one feel rachel included the effects of her rule were soon apparent every article of furniture changed its place every household nook was carefully examined and improved and every luckless individual who entertained a lingering kindness for rachel gray was affronted and effectually banished from the house from irascible madame rose down to peaceful mr jones rachel carried patience to a fault through her whole life she had been taught to suffer and endure silently and now burdened with the sense of her debt and obligation she knew not how to resist the domestic tyranny of this new tormentor the easiest course was to submit to rachel it seemed that such in common gratitude was her duty and accordingly she submitted but this was a time of probation and trial as such she ever looked back to it in after life to jane her patience seemed amazing and scarcely commendable i wonder you can bear with the old creetur that i do she said emphatically mrs brown means kindly said rachel and she has been a kind friend to me when i had no other friend i may well hare a little patience a little patience echoed jane indignantly a little patience when she always at you but rachel would hear no more on the subject if she bore with mrs brown it was not to murmur at her behind her back yet she was not so insensible to what she endured but that she felt it a positive relief when mrs brown went and paid one of her nieces a visit in the country and for a few weeks delivered the house of her presence internally rachel accused herself of ingratitude because she felt glad it very wrong of me i know she remorsefully thought but i feel as if i could not help it her health was now restored she had found some work to do with time she knew she should be able to pay mrs brown her mind recovered its habitual tone old thoughts old feelings laid by during the hour of trial and sickness but never forsaken returned to her now and time as it passed on matured a great thought in her heart who knows she often asked herself in her waking dreams who knows if the hour is not come at last my father cannot always turn his face from me love me at once he cannot but why should he not with time yet it was not at once that rachel acted on these thoughts never since he had received her so coldly had she crossed her father threshold but often in the evening she had walked up and down before his door looking at him through the shop window with sad and earnest eyes never seeking for more than that stolen glance though still with the persistency of a fond heart she looked forward to a happier future and thus she lingered until one morning when she rose nerved her heart and went out calmly resolved to bear as others to act she went to her father house she found him sturdy and stern planing with the vigour of a man in the prime of life his brow became clouded as he saw and recognized his daughter pale face and shrinking figure still he bade her come in for she stood on the threshold timidly waiting for a welcome and his ungraciousness was limited to the cold question of what had brought her i am come to see you father was her mild reply and as to this thomas gray said nothing rachel added my mother is dead i know it and have known it these three months he drily answered she died very happy resumed rachel and before she died she desired me to come and tell you that she sincerely forgave you all past unkindness a frown knit the rugged brow of thomas gray his late wife had had a sharp temper of her own and perhaps he thought himself as much sinned against as sinning but he made no comment father said rachel speaking from her very heart and looking earnestly in his face may i come and live with you thomas gray looked steadily at his daughter and did not reply but rachel resolved not to be easily disheartened persisted none the less father she resumed and her voice faltered with the depth of her emotion pray let me i know you do not care much for me i dare say you are right that i am not worth much but still i might be useful to you a burden i certainly should not be and in sickness in age i think i hope father you would like to have your daughter near you i am now your only child she added after a moment pause the only living thing of your blood not one relative have i in this wide world and you father you too are alone let me come to live with you pray let me if my presence is irksome to you added rachel gazing wistfully in his face as both hope and courage began to fail her i shall keep out of the way indeed indeed she added with tears in her eyes i shall he had heard her out very quietly and very quietly he replied rachel what did i go to america for rachel rather bewildered with the question faltered that she did not know and what did i come to live here for he continued rachel did not answer but there was a sad foreboding in her heart to be alone he resumed and he spoke with some sternness to be alone and he went back to his planing with tears which he saw not rachel looked at the stern selfish old man whom she called her father the sentence which he had uttered rung in her heart but she did not venture to dispute its justice her simple pleading had been heard and rejected more than she had said she could not say and it did not occur to her to urge a second time the homely eloquence which had so signally failed when first spoken but she made bold to prefer a timid and humble petition might she come to see him what for he bluntly asked to see how you are father replied poor rachel how i am he echoed with a suspicious gathering of the brow and why shouldn i be well just tell me that it might please providence to afflict you with sickness began rachel sickness sickness he interrupted indignantly i tell you woman i never was sick in my life is there the sign of illness or of disease upon me no indeed father there is not and could you find a man of my age half so healthy and so strong as i am ust tell me that he rather defiantly asked poor rachel was literal as truth instead of eluding a reply she simply said i have seen stronger men than you father oh i you have ave you he ejaculated eyeing her with very little favour and though rachel was not unconscious of her offence she added and strong or weak father are we not all in the hands of god from beneath his bushy grey eyebrows thomas gray looked askance at his daughter but love often rises to a fearlessness that makes it heroic and rachel not daunted resumed father she said earnestly you do not want me now i know and see it but if ever you should nd that time may come pray father pray send for me want you and what should i want you for asked thomas gray i cannot tell i do not know but you might want me remember that if you do you have but to send for me i am willing ever willing he looked at her as she stood there before him a pale sallow sickly girl then he laughed disdainfully and impatiently motioned her away as if his temper were chafed at her continued presence rachel felt indeed that her visit had been sufficiently long and not wishing to close on herself the possibility of return or she had one of those quietly pertinacious natures that never give up hope he calmly bade her father goodye without looking at her he muttered an unintelligible reply rachel left the shop and returned to her quiet street and solitary home yet solitary she did not find it true jane was out on some errand or other but mary was alone in the parlour she sat with her work on her lap crying as if her heart would break in vain she tried to hide or check her tears rachel saw mary grief and forgetting at once her own troubles she kindly sat down by the young girl and asked what ailed her at first mary would not speak then suddenly she threw her arms around rachel neck and with a fresh burst of tears she exclaimed oh dear dear miss gray i am so miserable what for child asked rachel astonished he gone e gone sobbed mary who is gone my dear mary hung down her head but rachel pressed her so kindly to speak that her heart opened and with many a hesitating pause and many a qualifying comment mary jones related to her kindearted listener a little story which lest the reader should not prove so indulgent or so patient as rachel gray we will relate in language plainer and more brief chapter time had worn on nine months in all had passed away since the opening of the teapot we must be quite frank mr jones had not always made the one pound ten a week dear profit and of course this affected all his calculations the ten per cent for increase of gain included there had been weeks when he had not realized more than one pound others when he made ten shillings ay and there had been weeks when all he could do f he did do so as to make both ends meet it was odd but it was so mr jones was at first much startled but he soon learned to reconcile himself to it it stands to reason he philosophically observed to mary it business you see it business the words explained all another drawback was that the front room which was worth five shillings a week as his landlord had proved to mr jones in their very first conversation and for which mr jones had therefore allowed n the faith of his landlord word hirteen pounds a year in his accounts never let at all this was the first intimation mr jones received of the practical business truth that it is necessary to allow for losses he had almost given up all thoughts of letting this unfortunate room and indeed the bill had had time to turn shabby and yellow in the shop window when one morning a young man entered the shop and in a cool deliberate tone said room to let yes sir replied jones rather impressed by his brief manner back or front front sir front capital room sir terms five shillings aeek sir a room worth six shillings anywhere else like to see it sir mary ary dear just mind the shop awhile will you mary came grumbling at being disturbed whilst her father hastened upstairs before the stranger and throwing the window open showed him a very dusty room not over and above well furnished capital room sir said mr jones winking shrewdly real brussels carpet portrait of her majesty above the manteliece and that bed sir ust feel that bed sir he added giving it a vigorous poke by way of proving its softness very cheerful lookut too the railroad just hard by all the trains passing without much minding these advantages the stranger cast a quick look round the room then said in his curt way take four shillings for it yes well then il come toight and without giving mr jones time to reply he walked downstairs and walked out through the shop well father have you let the room asked mary when her father came down still bewildered by the young man strange and abrupt manner well child he replied i suppose i may say i have for the young man is coming toight what his name promptly asked mary i blest if i know he never told me nor gave me time to ask but father you don mean to say you let the room to him without knowing his name but i didn let the room to him said mr jones it was he took it well that queer said mary queer i call it more than queer exclaimed the grocer now turning indignant at the treatment he had received but he shan sleep in it though till ie got his references i can tell him the words were scarcely out of his mouth when into the shop again walked the stranger my name is joseph saunders he said briefly and if you want to know more apply to mr smithson number thirteen in the alley hard by hel give you all the particulars having delivered which piece of information he once more vanished well there was nothing to say to this and mr jones who had an inquisitive temper was preparing to dart off to mr smithson who did indeed live hard by when mr joseph saunders once more appeared you like the first week he said and without waiting for a reply he laid four shillings down on the counter and again disappeared his time to return no more mary was very much struck he looks quite superior she said quite saunders oseph saunders what a nice name that all very well replied her father sweeping the four shillings into the till but i must have a word or two to say with mr smithson for all that his name is joseph saunders he took his hat and walked out to seek mr smithson an old and stiff dealer in earthenware who lived within a stonehrow of the teapot the day was fine and mr smithson was airing his pans and dishes and setting them along the pavement like traps for the feet of unwary passengers goodorning to you began jones in a conciliating tone goodorning replied or rather grunted mr smithson without taking the trouble to look up i have just come round to inquire about a young man is name is joseph saunders do you know him sose i do answered mr smithson too cautious to commit himself well then sose you do ou can tell me something about him can you what for drily asked the earthenware dealer what for exclaimed mr jones beginning to lose his temper why because he taken my front room and i want to know what sort of a chap he is and because too he has referred me to you hat what for well then said mr smithson il just tell you this first hel pay his rent second hel give no trouble third that all with which mr smithson who had for a moment looked up and paused in his occupation returned to his earthenware and what does he do asked mr jones not satisfied with this brief account if you was to stay here from now till toorrow morning surlily replied mr smithson you know no more from me mr jones whistled and walked off with his hands in his pockets he had been guilty of the unpardonable sin of not purchasing a shilling worth of mr smithson goods since he had come to the neighbourhood and of course mr smithson felt aggrieved well father eagerly exclaimed mary as soon as she saw her father who is he what is he what does he do is he married bless the girl interrupted mr jones how am i to know all that hel pay his rent and he respectable and more don concern us and it time for you to go to miss gray ain it with which limited information mary had perforce to remain satisfied the new lodger proved to be what mr jones graphically termed a very buttonedp sort of chap a tall dark silent and reserved man who paid his rent every week went out early every morning came home at ten every night and vanished every sunday we have already hinted that mr jones had a spice of curiosity this mystery teazed him and by dint of waylaying his guest both early and late he succeeded in ascertaining that he had recently left his situation in a large house in the city and that he was in search of another no more did mr joseph saunders choose to communicate but this was enough for some time the poor grocer had had a strong suspicion that he was not a very good business man that he wanted something energy daring he knew not what but something he was sure it was now he thought if i could secure such a young fellow as that it would be a capital thing for me and in time not a bad one for him for suppose that he becomes a co and marries mary why the house is his that all now i should like to know what man in the city will say to him aunders il make a co of you and you shall have my daughter fully impressed with the importance of the proposal he had to make mr jones accordingly walked up one morning to his lodger room and after a gentle knock obtained admittance but scarcely had he entered the room scarcely cast a look around him when his heart failed him joseph saunders was packing up going sir faintly said jones why yes replied the young man i have found a situation and so i am off naturally my week is up toorrow i believe but not having given notice i shall pay for next of course he thrust his hand in his pocket as he spoke poor mr jones was too much hurt with his disappointment to care about the four shillings pray don mention it he said hurriedly your time up toorrow and so there an end of it all which words applied to the end of his hopes more than anything else mr saunders gave him a look of slight surprise but said quietly no no mr jones what fair is fair i gave no notice and so here are your four shillings he laid them on the table as he spoke and resumed his packing he forgot to ask what had brought mr jones up to his room and mr jones no longer anxious to tell him pocketed his four shillings and withdrew hastily under pretence that he was wanted in the shop mr jones had not acted in all this without consulting his daughter she had tacitly approved his plans and when he had imprudently allowed her to see how he thought those plans likely to end by a matrimonial alliance between herself and young saunders a faint blush had come over the poor little thing sallow face and stooping to shun her father kind eye she pretended to pick up a needle that had not fallen and now she was waiting below for it was early yet and she had not gone to miss gray he was waiting to know the result of her father conference with mr saunders no wonder that he came down somewhat slowly and not a little crestallen all he said was he got a new situation and whistling by way of showing his utter unconcern he entered the shop where a dirty child with its chin resting on the counter was waiting to be served mary too had had her dreams innocent dreams made up of the shadow of love and of the substance of girlish vanity the poor child felt this blow the first her little life had known and childishly began to cry her eyes were red when she went to work but she sat in shadow and jane who seldom honoured miss jones with her notice saw nothing rachel gray was too much absorbed in her own thoughts to heed what passed around her it was only on her return that finding mary in tears she drew from her the little tale of her hope and disappointment it is not an easy task to console even the lightest sorrow for it is not easy to feel sympathy yet little as her grave mind and earnest heart could understand the troubles of mary jones little as she could feel in reality for the childish fancy to which they owed their birth rachel felt for the young girl grief such as it was and by sympathy and mild reasoning she soothed mary and sent her home partly consoled of course mr saunders was gone e had left too without any adieu or message mary vanity was as much hurt as her heart mr jones was not habitually a man of keen perceptions but love is ever quick it cut him to the heart to see his little mary so woebegone he looked at her wistfully tried to check a sigh and said as brightly as he could cheer up mary law bless you girl well have lots of lodgers yet and as to that saunders i don so much care about it now he gone he was a clever fellow but he hadn got no capital and as to taking a co without capital why none but a goodatured easy fellow like me would dream of such a thing now a days but as i said wel have lots of lodgers ots of lodgers we never had but that one all them nine months said mary with some asperity theye all a coming said her father gaily theye all a coming and he said it in such droll fashion and winked so knowingly that do what she could mary could not but laugh chapter mary was gone jane had come in but to go up to her room rachel sat alone in the little parlour reading by candleight and did she read indeed alas no her will fixed her eyes on the page but her mind received not the impressions it conveyed the sentences were vague and broken as images in a dream the words had no meaning outwardly calm as ever did rachel seem but there was a strange sorrow a strange tumult in her heart that day the hope of years had been wrecked that day she had offered herself and been finally rejected in vain she said to herself i must submit t is the will of god i must submit a voice within her ever seemed to say father father why hast thou forsaken me until at length rachel felt as if she could bear no more sorrows endured in silence are ever doubly felt the nature of rachel gray was silent she had never asked for sympathy she had early been taught to expect and accept in its stead its bitter stepister ridicule derided laughed at she had learned to dread that the look of a human being should catch a glimpse of her sorrows if her little troubles were thus treated ow would her heavier griefs fare and now no more than ever did rachel trouble any with her burden why should she who what was she that others should care whether or not her father loved her that he did not sufficiently condemned her to solitude the pitying eye of god might indeed look down upon her with tenderness and love but from her brethren rachel expected nothing and thus it was that on this night after consoling the idle sorrows of an indulged child rachel sitting in solitude found the weight of her own grief almost intolerable like all shy and nervous persons she was deeply excitable anger she knew not but emotions as vehement though more pure could trouble her heart and now she was moved and deeply moved by a sense of injustice and of wrong her father wronged her perhaps he knew it not but he wronged her god almighty had not given him a child she felt to treat it thus with mingled dislike and contempt were there none to receive his slights and his scorn but his own daughter she rose and walked up and down the room with some agitation then came calmer and gentler thoughts moving her heart until her tears flowed freely had she not failed that day ad she not been too cold in her entreaties too easily daunted by the first rejection had she but allowed her father to see the love deep and fervent which burned in his daughter heart e would not he could not so coldly have repelled and cast her from him and why not try again murmured an inner voice the kingdom of heaven is taken by storm nd what is the kingdom of heaven but the realm of love at first this seemed a thought so wild that rachel drew back from it in alarm as from an abyss yawning at her feet but even as our looks soon become familiar with images of the wildest danger so the thought returned and she shrank not back from it besides what had she to lose nothing with a sort of despair she resolved to go and seek thomas gray and attempt once more to move him if he rejects me now she added inwardly i shall submit and trouble him no more the hour was not late besides in her present mood the timid rachel felt above fear she was soon dressed on her road this time neither annoyance nor evil befell her she passed like a shadow through crowds and like a shadow was unheeded the night was dark and dreary a keen wind whistled along the streets ut for either cold or darkness rachel cared not her thoughts flowed full and free in her brain for once she felt that she could speak and a joyful presentiment in her heart told her that she would and should be heard nd not in vain absorbed in those thoughts rachel scarcely knew what speed she had made until with the mechanical impulse of habit she found herself stopping before the second hand ironmonger shop wakening as from a dream and smiling at herself she went on rachel had expected to find the shop of thomas gray closed and himself absent but the light that burned from his dwelling and shed its glow on the opposite houses made her heart beat with joy and hope timidly she looked in through the glass panes the shop was vacant her father was no doubt in the back parlour rachel entered the doorell rang she paused on the threshold expecting to see him appear from within nerving herself to bear his cold look and severe aspect but he came not he was either uptairs or in some other part of the house or next door with a neighbour there was a chair in the shop rachel took it sat down and waited ow long she herself never knew for seconds seemed hours and all true consciousness of time had left her at length she wondered then she feared hy was her father house so silent and so deserted she went to the door and looked down the street it was still and lonely every house was shot up and even from the neighbouring thoroughfare all sounds of motion and life seemed gone suddenly rachel remembered the little publicouse to which her father had once sent her she had often seen him going to it in the evening perhaps he was there now in the shadow of the houses she glided up to the tavern door t stood half open he cautiously looked in and standing as she did in the gloom of the street she could do so unseen the landlord sat dozing in the bar ot a soul was with him rachel glanced at the clock above his head it marked a quarter to twelve dismayed and alarmed she returned to her father house it so chanced that as she walked on the opposite side of the narrow street a circumstance that had before escaped her notice now struck her in the room above the shop of thomas gray there burned a light she stopped short and looked at it with a beating heart she felt sure her father was there rachel rentered the shop and again sat down resolved to be patient but her nervous restlessness soon became intolerable seized with an indefinite fear she rose took the light and entered the parlour it was vacant passing under a low door which she found ajar she went up a dark staircase it ended with a narrow landing and a solitary door she knocked and got no reply she tried it it yielded to her hand and opened but rachel did not cross the threshold she paused upon it awetruck at the sight she saw the room was a small one poorly famished with a low and narrow bed a table and a few chairs on the mantlehelf burned a tallow light dim and lurid for want of snuffing its dull glow fell on the motionless figure of thomas gray he sat straight and stiff in a wooden chair with a hand resting on each arm his face was ghastly pale and rigid as death his eyes stared on the blank wall before him and seemed void of sight my father is dead thought rachel she entered the room and went up to him but when she laid her hand on his arm a slight convulsive motion showed her that he still lived ay he lived of that living death which is worse than the true paralysis had fallen upon him without warning like a thief in the night it had come and in a few brief seconds it had laid low the proud man strength of that strength he had boasted in the morning twelve hours had not gone round here was it now rachel did not lose her presence of mind how she went out found a doctor and brought him back she never exactly knew but she did it the medical man looked at thomas gray then at rachel you are his daughter he said kindly yes sir i am well then my poor girl i am very sorry for you ery sorry your father may live years but i can hold out no prospect of recovery none sir faltered rachel looking wistfully in his face not the least better i should tell you so at once than deceive you but rachel would not ould not believe him the sentence was too hard too pitiless to be true father father do you know me she cried he stared vacantly in her face did he know her perhaps he did who can tell how far the spirit lived in that dead body but if know her he did gone was the time when he could hold intercourse with that long slighted and now bitterly avenged daughter in vain she clung weeping around his neck in vain she called on him to reply he merely looked at her in the same vacant way and said childishly never mind but you know me ou know me father said rachel again he looked at her vacantly and still the only words he uttered were never mind his mind is gone for ever said the doctor rachel did not answer she clasped her hands and looked with wistful sadness on the old man blank face with a pang she felt and saw that now indeed her dream was over hat never never upon earth should she win that long hopedor treasure er father love chapter in the grey of the morning rachel brought her father to the humble little home which he had voluntarily forsaken years before thomas gray was not merely a paralyzed and helpless old man he was also destitute little more than what sufficed to cover his current expenses did rachel find in his dwelling his furniture was old and worthless and the goodill of the business scarcely paid the arrears of rent but the world rarely gives us credit for good motives it was currently reported that thomas gray was a wealthy man and that if rachel gray did not let him go to the workhouse she knew why as if she couldn let him go and keep his money too indignantly exclaimed jane when she heard this slander and as discretion was not jane virtue she repeated all to rachel gray poor rachel coloured slightly it seemed strange and somewhat hard too that her conduct should be judged thus but the flush passed from her pale face and the momentary emotion from her heart let the world think and say what it likes she thought i need not and i will not care not long after rachel brought home her father jane left her the time of her apprenticeship was out besides she was going to marry she showed more emotion on their parting than might have been expected from her god bless you miss gray she said several times god bless you ou are a good one whatever the world may think the praise was qualified and perhaps rachel felt it to be so for she smiled but she took it as jane meant it indly amity and peace marked their separation rachel now remained alone with her father and mary the young girl was not observant she saw but a quiet woman and a helpless old man with grey hair and stern features blank of meaning who sat the whole day long by the fireide waited on by his patient daughter sometimes indeed when rachel gray attended on her father with more than usual tenderness when she lingered near his chair looking wistfully in his face or with timid and tender hand gently smoothed away his whitened hair from his rugged brow sometimes then mary looked and wondered and felt vaguely moved but she was too childish to know why and indeed the story of rachel life at this time cannot be told it was beautiful but its beauty was not of earth and to earthly glance cannot be revealed it lay a divine secret between her heart and god this peace was not destined to last rachel and her father sat alone one morning in the parlour when mrs brown who had found the street door ajar burst in without preliminary warning she was scarlet and looked in a towering passion you audacious creatur she screamed you audacious hussey how dare you bring that man in this house n my house how dare you he is my father said rachel confounded both at the accusation and at the unexpected appearance of mrs brown the reply exasperated mrs brown she had never felt any extraordinary friendship or affection for her deceased cousin but she had always entertained a very acute sense of her cousin wrongs and had accordingly honoured thomas gray with no small share of hatred and vituperation and that rachel should not feel as she did on the subject or should presume to remember that the sinner was her father was in mrs brown eyes an offence of the deepest dye she gave her feelings free vent she was a vulgar woman and had a flow of vulgar eloquence at her command she overwhelmed rachel and thomas gray with sarcasm scorn and abuse and rachel answered not one word but heard her out still as a statue and pale as death mrs brown too was pale but it was with wrath do you know she added trembling from head to foot with that passion do you know that i could turn you out on the streets you and your beggarly father o you know that rachel did know it and groaned inwardly mrs brown saw her agony and triumphed in the consciousness of her own power but the very violence of her anger had by this time exhausted it she felt much calmer and took a more rational view of things i am a fool to mind what a simpleton like you does observed mrs brown with that disregard of politeness which was one of her attributes for being a simpleton how can you but do the acts of a simpleton as to bringing your father here you must have been mad to think of it for if you can support yourself how can you support him however it lucky i come in time to set all to rights what his parish marylebone ain it i shall see the overseer this very day and manage that for you and it just as well added mrs brown divesting herself of bonnet and shawl and proceeding to make herself at home that you didn meddle in it pretty mess you have made of it il be bound well and what do you stand dreaming there for make me a cup of tea ill you i am just ready to drop with it all as a proof of her assertion she sank on the chair next her took out her pocketandkerchief and began fanning herself but instead of complying with mrs brown orders rachel gray stood before that lady motionless and pale she looked her in the face steadily and in a firm clear voice she deliberately said mrs brown my father shall never whilst i live go to a workhouse what screamed mrs brown i say repeated rachel that my father shall never whilst god gives his daughter life go to a workhouse mrs brown was confounded hen she laughed derisively nonsense rachel she said nonsense why i can turn you out this very instant but the threat fell harmless rachel was strong in that hour her cheek had colour her eye had light her heart had courage she looked at the helpless old man who had drawn this storm on her head then at mrs brown and calmly laying her hand on the shoulder of thomas gray she again looked in mrs brown face and silently smiled her choice was made er resolve was taken will you send him to the workhouse or not imperatively cried mrs brown no deliberately replied rachel oh very well mam very well echoed mrs brown laughing bitterly please yourself ray please yourself so that is my reward for saving you from beggary is it very well mam you and your father may pack off together hat all be it so rather solemnly replied rachel be it so what i leave in this house will i trust cancel the debt i owe you father she added stooping towards him lean on my shoulder and get up we must go with apathy thomas gray had heard all that had passed and with apathy he trembling rose and complied with rachel intimation and looking in her face he uttered his usual childish never mind but before they reached the door mrs brown to the surprise and dismay of rachel went into violent hysterics she was an overearing and illempered woman but her heart was not wholly unkind and on seeing that rachel so readily took her at her word she was overwhelmed with mingled rage and shame hastily making her father sit down on the nearest chair rachel ran to mrs brown assistance a fit of weeping and bitter reproaches followed the hysterics and rachel was convicted of being the most ungrateful creature on the face of the earth in vain rachel attempted a justification mrs brown drowned her in a torrent of speech and remained the most injured of women the scene ended as such scenes ever end there was a compromise the victim made every concession and the triumphant tyrant gained more than her point in short that her father might not want the shelter of a roof rachel agreed to remain in the house and mrs brown kindly agreed to come and live in it and use rachel as her servant and domestic slave by which mrs brown besides keeping her firm hold on rachel o slight consideration with one who loved power beyond everything else a considerable saving in her income oh my father y father thought rachel as she bent over his chair that night and tears which he felt not dropped on his gray hair little do you know what i shall have to bear for your sake she did not speak aloud yet he seemed vaguely conscious that something lay on her mind for he shook his head and uttered his eternal never mind ever mind and i will not mind o help me god fervently answered rachel aloud and she did not mind but alas what now was her fate ask it not she had made her sacrifice in the spirit of utter abnegation and none need count the cost which she never reckoned chapter the same cloud of trouble and sorrow that now darkened the daily life of rachel gray soon gathered over her neighbours and friends with boding and pain she watched the coming of a calamity to them still invisible mr jones got up one morning and felt exactly as usual he took down his shutters and no presentiment warned him of the sight that was going to greet his eyes the teapot stood at the corner of a street which had naturally another corner facing it that corner et it be angle if you like critical reader ad from time immemorial been in the possession of a brown tottering untenanted house whose broken parlour windows mr jones had always seen filled with blank oak shutters strong enough for security and closing within but now to his dismay he saw halfozen workmen pulling down the bottom of the house and leaving the top untouched his heart gave a great thump in his bosom i a lost man he thought theye making a shop of it and so they were but what sort of a shop was it to be that was the question jones lost no time he put down his shutter thrust his hands in his pocket is usual resource when he wanted to look unconcerned sauntered awhile down the street talked to some children and finally came back to the workmen pulling it down he said after looking at them for awhile an old rubbishing concern in it pulling it down echoed one of the workmen giving him a contemptuous look much you know about it well but what is it to be asked jones looking as simple as he could stables stables a shop stupid oh a shop ah it to be a shop is it and what sort of a shop publicouse we want one better ask mr smithson the house is his oh it mr smithson is it jones walked away much relieved mr smithson had long talked of removing himself and his earthenware to some larger tenement than that which he now occupied a pleasant neighbour he was not but anything was better than the fear which had for a moment seized the heart of richard jones the workmen did not linger over their task indeed mr smithson took care that they should not night and morning the whole day long jones saw him after them he watched him through the pots of scotch marmelade that decorated the front of his shop window and internally admired the indefatigable zeal mr smithson displayed humbly too he contrasted it with his own deficiencies in that respect i ain got no spirit that the fact of it confessed mr jones in his own heart in a comparatively short space of time the bricklayers had done their task they were succeeded by the carpenters who proved as zealous and as active and now fear and trembling once more seized the heart of richard jones what were those busy carpenters about why were they fabricating shelves and drawers drawers of every size some small some large just such drawers as he had in his shop he questioned one of their body what was to be sold in that shop id he know the man could not tell but rather fancied it was to be an oil and colour shop then it was not to be mr smithson own oh no certainly jones walked away a prey to the most tormenting anxiety was the man right as he wrong had he spoken the truth had he deceived him was he jones now that his business was really improving was he threatened with a rival or was this but a false alarm the phantom of his fears what would he not have given to think so his ease was the more distressing that he dared unburthen his mind to none to mary least of any she poor little thing far from sharing her father fears rejoiced in the prospect of a new shop itl make the street quite gay she said to her father especially if it a linenraper i wonder if theyl have pretty bonnets she tried to obtain information on this interesting point but failed completely suspense is worse than the worst reality richard jones lost appetite and sleep slumber when it came was accompanied by such fearful nightmare that waking thoughts though bitter were not at least so terrible he could not forget the opposite shop in the first place because he saw it every morning with his bodily eyes in the second because it ever haunted that inward eye called by wordsworth he bliss of solitude how far it proved a bliss to richard jones the reader may imagine all this time the shop had been progressing and now bricklayer carpenter glazier and decorator haying done their work it was completed and ready for its tenant who however seemed in no hurry to appear this proved the worst time for richard jones to look at that shop all the day long and not to be able to make anything of it to wonder whether it were a friend or an enemy whether it would give new lustre to the street on which he had cast his fortunes or blast those fortunes in their very birth was surely no ordinary trial well might he grow thin haggard and worn at length the crisis came at the close of november a dread rumour reached his ears the shop was to be a grocer shop and it was to open a week before christmas that same evening mary came home crying and much agitated mrs brown with her usual kindness had given information oh father she exclaimed mrs brown says it to be a grocer shop so i have heard toay he replied a little gloomily never mind child he added attempting to cheer up and a rueful attempt it turned out never mind i dareay there room for two he said it but he knew it was not true he knew there was room but for one and that if two came why either both must perish after a fierce contest or one survive and triumph over the ruin of the other all he knew it and groaned at the thought i wish you wouldn father said mary again beginning to cry mary my pet i can help it said jones fairly giving way to feelings too long repressed there aint room for two that the plain truth of it and if another grocer comes why he must ruin me or i must ruin him and that aint pleasant to think of is it mary was not without spirit father she cried resolutely if it to be why it to be and it can be helped but i wouldn give in without trying to get the upper hand that i wouldn her father shook his head disconsolately child he said it like setting an old horse against a mettlesome young one that new fellow has got every advantage look at his shop then look at mine why his is twice as big again look at his front all plate glass look at his counters polished oak well and can you get the shop ur shop one up too ambitiously asked mary there time yet why yes there is ut the money mary dear never mind the money no more i would my pet if i had got it but you see the one pound ten a week hasn kept up and those things cost a precious deal mary reflected a while sose she suggested you got in a fresh stock of jams in glass jars for the front window and what shall we do with the old eat them and sose you add a few pots of pickles pickles echoed jones looking doubtful and sose continued mary you add macaroni and sauces and set up as a superior grocer jones scratched his head law child he said this aint a stylish neighbourhood nd whol buy my macaroni and my sauces why no one of course superciliously replied mary it not to sell them you want them it for the look of the thing o be a superior grocer you know the words superior grocer gently tickled secret ambition mr richard jones seriously promised his daughter to think about it mary had other thoughts which she did not communicate to her father and of these thoughts the chief was to find out what had become of mr saunders and return to the old plan of enticing him into partnership she was so full of this project that partly to get assistance partly to take a little consequence on herself she imparted it under the strictest secrecy to rachel gray and at the close she pretty clearly hinted that if mr joseph saunders behaved well he might in time aspire to the honour of her hand rachel heard her silently and looked very uncomfortable my dear she said hesitatingly you must not think of anything of the kind indeed you must not and why shouldn i tartly asked mary with a saucy toss of the head because my dear said rachel gently and sadly jane is going to marry that mr saunders who ifs cousin to mr smithson who is putting him in the new grocer shop for a moment mary remained stunned then she burst into tears he a mean sneaking fellow that what he is she cried oh my dear y dear gently said rachel will you not take something from the hand of god we have all our lot to bear she added with a half sigh but gently though rachel spoke mary looked more rebellious than submissive he a mean she began again the entrance of mrs brown interrupted her mrs brown was in a very ill humour at first she had behaved pretty decently to rachel and her father but of late she had given free vent to her natural disposition and it was not we have no need to say an amiable one on the present occasion she had moreover additional cause for dissatisfaction and so she exclaimed slamming the door and irefully addressing rachel and so your beggarly father has been and broke my china cup eh mam rachel turned pale on hearing of this new disaster indeed mrs brown she began don mrs brown me was the indignant rejoinder i tell you i have never had a moment peace ease and quiet and never shall have ince you and your beggarly father entered this house for by a strange perversion of ideas mrs brown persisted in asserting and thinking that it was rachel and her father who had entered the house and not she and this rachel might have said and she might have added that to bear daily reproaches and insults formed no part of her agreement with mrs brown she might ut where would the use have been she was free to depart any day she liked and since she preferred to stay why not bear it all patiently and so she remained silent whilst mrs brown scolded and railed for as she had said to mary we have all our lot to bear the lesson was lost on the young girl no sooner was mrs brown back turned than again mary abused mr saunders jane mr smithson and the new shop collectively until she could go home to her father he already knew all and gloomily exclaimed that it was no more than he expected that it was all of a piece and that
