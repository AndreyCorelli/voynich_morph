the world is so taken up of late with novels and romances that it will be hard for a private history to be taken for genuine where the names and other circumstances of the person are concealed and on this account we must be content to leave the reader to pass his own opinion upon the ensuing sheet and take it just as he pleases the author is here supposed to be writing her own history and in the very beginning of her account she gives the reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true name after which there is no occasion to say any more about that it is true that the original of this story is put into new words and the style of the famous lady we here speak of is a little altered particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester words that she told it at first the copy which came first to hand having been written in language more like one still in newgate than one grown penitent and humble as she afterwards pretends to be the pen employed in finishing her story and making it what you now see it to be has had no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be seen and to make it speak language fit to be read when a woman debauched from her youth nay even being the offspring of debauchery and vice comes to give an account of all her vicious practices and even to descend to the particular occasions and circumstances by which she ran through in threescore years an author must be hard put to it wrap it up so clean as not to give room especially for vicious readers to turn it to his disadvantage all possible care however has been taken to give no lewd ideas no immodest turns in the new dressing up of this story no not to the worst parts of her expressions to this purpose some of the vicious part of her life which could not be modestly told is quite left out and several other parts are very much shortened what is left tis hoped will not offend the chastest reader or the modest hearer and as the best use is made even of the worst story the moral tis hoped will keep the reader serious even where the story might incline him to be otherwise to give the history of a wicked life repented of necessarily requires that the wicked part should be make as wicked as the real history of it will bear to illustrate and give a beauty to the penitent part which is certainly the best and brightest if related with equal spirit and life it is suggested there cannot be the same life the same brightness and beauty in relating the penitent part as is in the criminal part if there is any truth in that suggestion i must be allowed to say tis because there is not the same taste and relish in the reading and indeed it is too true that the difference lies not in the real worth of the subject so much as in the gust and palate of the reader but as this work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to read it and how to make the good uses of it which the story all along recommends to them so it is to be hoped that such readers will be more pleased with the moral than the fable with the application than with the relation and with the end of the writer than with the life of the person written of there is in this story abundance of delightful incidents and all of them usefully applied there is an agreeable turn artfully given them in the relating that naturally instructs the reader either one way or other the first part of her lewd life with the young gentleman at colchester has so many happy turns given it to expose the crime and warn all whose circumstances are adapted to it of the ruinous end of such things and the foolish thoughtless and abhorred conduct of both the parties that it abundantly atones for all the lively description she gives of her folly and wickedness the repentance of her lover at the bath and how brought by the just alarm of his fit of sickness to abandon her the just caution given there against even the lawful intimacies of the dearest friends and how unable they are to preserve the most solemn resolutions of virtue without divine assistance these are parts which to a just discernment will appear to have more real beauty in them than all the amorous chain of story which introduces it in a word as the whole relation is carefully garbled of all the levity and looseness that was in it so it all applied and with the utmost care to virtuous and religious uses none can without being guilty of manifest injustice cast any reproach upon it or upon our design in publishing it the advocates for the stage have in all ages made this the great argument to persuade people that their plays are useful and that they ought to be allowed in the most civilised and in the most religious government namely that they are applied to virtuous purposes and that by the most lively representations they fail not to recommend virtue and generous principles and to discourage and expose all sorts of vice and corruption of manners and were it true that they did so and that they constantly adhered to that rule as the test of their acting on the theatre much might be said in their favour throughout the infinite variety of this book this fundamental is most strictly adhered to there is not a wicked action in any part of it but is first and last rendered unhappy and unfortunate there is not a superlative villain brought upon the stage but either he is brought to an unhappy end or brought to be a penitent there is not an ill thing mentioned but it is condemned even in the relation nor a virtuous just thing but it carries its praise along with it what can more exactly answer the rule laid down to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections leaving against them namely of example of bad company obscene language and the like upon this foundation this book is recommended to the reader as a work from every part of which something may be learned and some just and religious inference is drawn by which the reader will have something of instruction if he pleases to make use of it all the exploits of this lady of fame in her depredations upon mankind stand as so many warnings to honest people to beware of them intimating to them by what methods innocent people are drawn in plundered and robbed and by consequence how to avoid them her robbing a little innocent child dressed fine by the vanity of the mother to go to the dancingchool is a good memento to such people hereafter as is likewise her picking the gold watch from the young lady s side in the park her getting a parcel from a harerained wench at the coaches in st john street her booty made at the fire and again at harwich all give us excellent warnings in such cases to be more present to ourselves in sudden surprises of every sort her application to a sober life and industrious management at last in virginia with her transported spouse is a story fruitful of instruction to all the unfortunate creatures who are obliged to seek their restablishment abroad whether by the misery of transportation or other disaster letting them know that diligence and application have their due encouragement even in the remotest parts of the world and that no case can be so low so despicable or so empty of prospect but that an unwearied industry will go a great way to deliver us from it will in time raise the meanest creature to appear again in the world and give him a new case for his life there are a few of the serious inferences which we are led by the hand to in this book and these are fully sufficient to justify any man in recommending it to the world and much more to justify the publication of it there are two of the most beautiful parts still behind which this story gives some idea of and lets us into the parts of them but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same volume and indeed are as i may call them whole volumes of themselves viz the life of her governess as she calls her who had run through it seems in a few years all the eminent degrees of a gentlewoman a whore and a bawd a midwife and a midwifeeeper as they are called a pawnbroker a childtaker a receiver of thieves and of thieves purchase that is to say of stolen goods and in a word herself a thief a breeder up of thieves and the like and yet at last a penitent the second is the life of her transported husband a highwayman who it seems lived a twelve years life of successful villainy upon the road and even at last came off so well as to be a volunteer transport not a convict and in whose life there is an incredible variety but as i have said these are things too long to bring in here so neither can i make a promise of the coming out by themselves we cannot say indeed that this history is carried on quite to the end of the life of this famous moll flanders as she calls herself for nobody can write their own life to the full end of it unless they can write it after they are dead but her husband s life being written by a third hand gives a full account of them both how long they lived together in that country and how they both came to england again after about eight years in which time they were grown very rich and where she lived it seems to be very old but was not so extraordinary a penitent as she was at first it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abhorrence of her former life and of every part of it in her last scene at maryland and virginia many pleasant things happened which makes that part of her life very agreeable but they are not told with the same elegancy as those accounted for by herself so it is still to the more advantage that we break off here moll flanders my true name is so well known in the records or registers at newgate and in the old bailey and there are some things of such consequence still depending there relating to my particular conduct that it is not be expected i should set my name or the account of my family to this work perhaps after my death it may be better known at present it would not be proper nor not though a general pardon should be issued even without exceptions and reserve of persons or crimes it is enough to tell you that as some of my worst comrades who are out of the way of doing me harm having gone out of the world by the steps and the string as i often expected to g knew me by the name of moll flanders so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that name till i dare own who i have been as well as who i am i have been told that in one of neighbour nations whether it be in france or where else i know not they have an order from the king that when any criminal is condemned either to die or to the galleys or to be transported if they leave any children as such are generally unprovided for by the poverty or forfeiture of their parents so they are immediately taken into the care of the government and put into a hospital called the house of orphans where they are bred up clothed fed taught and when fit to go out are placed out to trades or to services so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious behaviour had this been the custom in our country i had not been left a poor desolate girl without friends without clothes without help or helper in the world as was my fate and by which i was not only exposed to very great distresses even before i was capable either of understanding my case or how to amend it but brought into a course of life which was not only scandalous in itself but which in its ordinary course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body but the case was otherwise here my mother was convicted of felony for a certain petty theft scarce worth naming viz having an opportunity of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in cheapside the circumstances are too long to repeat and i have heard them related so many ways that i can scarce be certain which is the right account however it was this they all agree in that my mother pleaded her belly and being found quick with child she was respited for about seven months in which time having brought me into the world and being about again she was called down as they term it to her former judgment but obtained the favour of being transported to the plantations and left me about half a year old and in bad hands you may be sure this is too near the first hours of my life for me to relate anything of myself but by hearsay it is enough to mention that as i was born in such an unhappy place i had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy nor can i give the least account how i was kept alive other than that as i have been told some relation of my mother s took me away for a while as a nurse but at whose expense or by whose direction i know nothing at all of it the first account that i can recollect or could ever learn of myself was that i had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies or egyptians but i believe it was but a very little while that i had been among them for i had not had my skin discoloured or blackened as they do very young to all the children they carry about with them nor can i tell how i came among them or how i got from them it was at colchester in essex that those people left me and i have a notion in my head that i left them there that is that i hid myself and would not go any farther with the but i am not able to be particular in that account only this i remember that being taken up by some of the parish officers of colchester i gave an account that i came into the town with the gypsies but that i would not go any farther with them and that so they had left me but whither they were gone that i knew not nor could they expect it of me for though they send round the country to inquire after them it seems they could not be found i was now in a way to be provided for for though i was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law yet as my case came to be known and that i was too young to do any work being not above three years old compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order some care to be taken of me and i became one of their own as much as if i had been born in the place in the provision they made for me it was my good hap to be put to nurse as they call it to a woman who was indeed poor but had been in better circumstances and who got a little livelihood by taking such as i was supposed to be and keeping them with all necessaries till they were at a certain age in which it might be supposed they might go to service or get their own bread this woman had also had a little school which she kept to teach children to read and to work and having as i have said lived before that in good fashion she bred up the children she took with a great deal of art as well as with a great deal of care but that which was worth all the rest she bred them up very religiously being herself a very sober pious woman very houseifely and clean and very mannerly and with good behaviour so that in a word expecting a plain diet coarse lodging and mean clothes we were brought up as mannerly and as genteelly as if we had been at the dancingchool i was continued here till i was eight years old when i was terrified with news that the magistrates as i think they called the had ordered that i should go to service i was able to do but very little service wherever i was to go except it was to run of errands and be a drudge to some cookmaid and this they told me of often which put me into a great fright for i had a thorough aversion to going to service as they called it that is to be a servan though i was so young and i told my nurse as we called her that i believed i could get my living without going to service if she pleased to let me for she had taught me to work with my needle and spin worsted which is the chief trade of that city and i told her that if she would keep me i would work for her and i would work very hard i talked to her almost every day of working hard and in short i did nothing but work and cry all day which grieved the good kind woman so much that at last she began to be concerned for me for she loved me very well one day after this as she came into the room where all we poor children were at work she sat down just over against me not in her usual place as mistress but as if she set herself on purpose to observe me and see me work i was doing something she had set me to as i remember it was marking some shirts which she had taken to make and after a while she began to talk to me thou foolish child says she thou art always crying for i was crying the prithee what dost cry for because they will take me away says i and put me to service and i can t work housework well child says she but though you can t work housework as you call it you will learn it in time and they won t put you to hard things at first yes they will says i and if i can t do it they will beat me and the maids will beat me to make me do great work and i am but a little girl and i can t do it and then i cried again till i could not speak any more to her this moved my good motherly nurse so that she from that time resolved i should not go to service yet so she bid me not cry and she would speak to mr mayor and i should not go to service till i was bigger well this did not satisfy me for to think of going to service was such a frightful thing to me that if she had assured me i should not have gone till i was twenty years old it would have been the same to me i should have cried i believe all the time with the very apprehension of its being to be so at last when she saw that i was not pacified yet she began to be angry with me and what would you have says she don t i tell you that you shall not go to service till your are bigger ay said i but then i must go at last why what said she is the girl mad what would you be a gentlewoman yes says i and cried heartily till i roared out again this set the old gentlewoman at me as you may be sure it would well madam forsooth says she gibing at me you would be a gentlewoman and pray how will you come to be a gentlewoman what will you do it by your fingers end yes says i again very innocently why what can you earn says she what can you get at your work threepence said i when i spin and fourpence when i work plain work alas poor gentlewoman said she again laughing what will that do for thee it will keep me says i if you will let me live with you and this i said in such a poor petitioning tone that it made the poor woman s heart yearn to me as she told me afterwards but says she that will not keep you and buy you clothes too and who must buy the little gentlewoman clothes says she and smiled all the while at me i will work harder then says i and you shall have it all poor child it won t keep you says she it will hardly keep you in victuals then i will have no victuals says i again very innocently let me but live with you why can you live without victuals says she yes again says i very much like a child you may be sure and still i cried heartily i had no policy in all this you may easily see it was all nature but it was joined with so much innocence and so much passion that in short it set the good motherly creature aeeping too and she cried at last as fast as i did and then took me and led me out of the teachingoom come says she you shan t go to service you shall live with me and this pacified me for the present some time after this she going to wait on the mayor and talking of such things as belonged to her business at last my story came up and my good nurse told mr mayor the whole tale he was so pleased with it that he would call his lady and his two daughters to hear it and it made mirth enough among them you may be sure however not a week had passed over but on a sudden comes mrs mayoress and her two daughters to the house to see my old nurse and to see her school and the children when they had looked about them a little well mrs says the mayoress to my nurse and pray which is the little lass that intends to be a gentlewoman i heard her and i was terribly frighted at first though i did not know why neither but mrs mayoress comes up to me well miss says she and what are you at work upon the word miss was a language that had hardly been heard of in our school and i wondered what sad name it was she called me however i stood up made a curtsy and she took my work out of my hand looked on it and said it was very well then she took up one of the hands nay says she the child may come to be a gentlewoman for aught anybody knows she has a gentlewoman s hand says she this pleased me mightily you may be sure but mrs mayoress did not stop there but giving me my work again she put her hand in her pocket gave me a shilling and bid me mind my work and learn to work well and i might be a gentlewoman for aught she knew now all this while my good old nurse mrs mayoress and all the rest of them did not understand me at all for they meant one sort of thing by the word gentlewoman and i meant quite another for alas all i understood by being a gentlewoman was to be able to work for myself and get enough to keep me without that terrible bugbear going to service whereas they meant to live great rich and high and i know not what well after mrs mayoress was gone her two daughters came in and they called for the gentlewoman too and they talked a long while to me and i answered them in my innocent way but always if they asked me whether i resolved to be a gentlewoman i answered yes at last one of them asked me what a gentlewoman was that puzzled me much but however i explained myself negatively that it was one that did not go to service to do housework they were pleased to be familiar with me and like my little prattle to them which it seems was agreeable enough to them and they gave me money too as for my money i gave it all to my mistressurse as i called her and told her she should have all i got for myself when i was a gentlewoman as well as now by this and some other of my talk my old tutoress began to understand me about what i meant by being a gentlewoman and that i understood by it no more than to be able to get my bread by my own work and at last she asked me whether it was not so i told her yes and insisted on it that to do so was to be a gentlewoman for says i there is such a one naming a woman that mended lace and washed the ladies lacedeads she says i is a gentlewoman and they call her madam poor child says my good old nurse you may soon be such a gentlewoman as that for she is a person of ill fame and has had two or three bastards i did not understand anything of that but i answered i am sure they call her madam and she does not go to service nor do housework and therefore i insisted that she was a gentlewoman and i would be such a gentlewoman as that the ladies were told all this again to be sure and they made themselves merry with it and every now and then the young ladies mr mayor s daughters would come and see me and ask where the little gentlewoman was which made me not a little proud of myself this held a great while and i was often visited by these young ladies and sometimes they brought others with them so that i was known by it almost all over the town i was now about ten years old and began to look a little womanish for i was mighty grave and humble very mannerly and as i had often heard the ladies say i was pretty and would be a very handsome woman so you may be sure that hearing them say so made me not a little proud however that pride had no ill effect upon me yet only as they often gave me money and i gave it to my old nurse she honest woman was so just to me as to lay it all out again for me and gave me headresses and linen and gloves and ribbons and i went very neat and always clean for that i would do and if i had rags on i would always be clean or else i would dabble them in water myself but i say my good nurse when i had money given me very honestly laid it out for me and would always tell the ladies this or that was bought with their money and this made them oftentimes give me more till at last i was indeed called upon by the magistrates as i understood it to go out to service but then i was come to be so good a workwoman myself and the ladies were so kind to me that it was plain i could maintain myself that is to say i could earn as much for my nurse as she was able by it to keep me so she told them that if they would give her leave she would keep the gentlewoman as she called me to be her assistant and teach the children which i was very well able to do for i was very nimble at my work and had a good hand with my needle though i was yet very young but the kindness of the ladies of the town did not end here for when they came to understand that i was no more maintained by the public allowance as before they gave me money oftener than formerly and as i grew up they brought me work to do for them such as linen to make and laces to mend and heads to dress up and not only paid me for doing them but even taught me how to do them so that now i was a gentlewoman indeed as i understood that word i not only found myself clothes and paid my nurse for my keeping but got money in my pocket too beforehand the ladies also gave me clothes frequently of their own or their children s some stockings some petticoats some gowns some one thing some another and these my old woman managed for me like a mere mother and kept them for me obliged me to mend them and turn them and twist them to the best advantage for she was a rare housewife at last one of the ladies took so much fancy to me that she would have me home to her house for a month she said to be among her daughters now though this was exceeding kind in her yet as my old good woman said to her unless she resolved to keep me for good and all she would do the little gentlewoman more harm than good well says the lady that s true and therefore i only take her home for a week then that i may see how my daughters and she agree together and how i like her temper and then i tell you more and in the meantime if anybody comes to see her as they used to do you may only tell them you have sent her out to my house this was prudently managed enough and i went to the lady s house but i was so pleased there with the young ladies and they so pleased with me that i had enough to do to come away and they were as unwilling to part with me however i did come away and lived almost a year more with my honest old woman and began now to be very helpful to her for i was almost fourteen years old was tall of my age and looked a little womanish but i had such a taste of genteel living at the lady s house that i was not so easy in my old quarters as i used to be and i thought it was fine to be a gentlewoman indeed for i had quite other notions of a gentlewoman now than i had before and as i thought i say that it was fine to be a gentlewoman so i loved to be among gentlewomen and therefore i longed to be there again about the time that i was fourteen years and a quarter old my good nurse mother i rather to call her fell sick and died i was then in a sad condition indeed for as there is no great bustle in putting an end to a poor body s family when once they are carried to the grave so the poor good woman being buried the parish children she kept were immediately removed by the churchardens the school was at an end and the children of it had no more to do but just stay at home till they were sent somewhere else and as for what she left her daughter a married woman with six or seven children came and swept it all away at once and removing the goods they had no more to say to me than to jest with me and tell me that the little gentlewoman might set up for herself if she pleased i was frighted out of my wits almost and knew not what to do for i was as it were turned out of doors to the wide world and that which was still worse the old honest woman had twondwenty shillings of mine in her hand which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had in the world and when i asked the daughter for it she huffed me and laughed at me and told me she had nothing to do with it it was true the good poor woman had told her daughter of it and that it lay in such a place that it was the child s money and had called once or twice for me to give it me but i was unhappily out of the way somewhere or other and when i came back she was past being in a condition to speak of it however the daughter was so honest afterwards as to give it me though at first she used me cruelly about it now was i a poor gentlewoman indeed and i was just that very night to be turned into the wide world for the daughter removed all the goods and i had not so much as a lodging to go to or a bit of bread to eat but it seems some of the neighbours who had known my circumstances took so much compassion of me as to acquaint the lady in whose family i had been a week as i mentioned above and immediately she sent her maid to fetch me away and two of her daughters came with the maid though unsent so i went with them bag and baggage and with a glad heart you may be sure the fright of my condition had made such an impression upon me that i did not want now to be a gentlewoman but was very willing to be a servant and that any kind of servant they thought fit to have me be but my new generous mistress for she exceeded the good woman i was with before in everything as well as in the matter of estate i say in everything except honesty and for that though this was a lady most exactly just yet i must not forget to say on all occasions that the first though poor was as uprightly honest as it was possible for any one to be i was no sooner carried away as i have said by this good gentlewoman but the first lady that is to say the mayoress that was sent her two daughters to take care of me and another family which had taken notice of me when i was the little gentlewoman and had given me work to do sent for me after her so that i was mightily made of as we say nay and they were not a little angry especially madam the mayoress that her friend had taken me away from her as she called it for as she said i was hers by right she having been the first that took any notice of me but they that had me would not part with me and as for me though i should have been very well treated with any of the others yet i could not be better than where i was here i continued till i was between seventeen and eighteen years old and here i had all the advantages for my education that could be imagined the lady had masters home to the house to teach her daughters to dance and to speak french and to write and other to teach them music and i was always with them i learned as fast as they and though the masters were not appointed to teach me yet i learned by imitation and inquiry all that they learned by instruction and direction so that in short i learned to dance and speak french as well as any of them and to sing much better for i had a better voice than any of them i could not so readily come at playing on the harpsichord or spinet because i had no instrument of my own to practice on and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it which was uncertain but yet i learned tolerably well too and the young ladies at length got two instruments that is to say a harpsichord and a spinet too and then they taught me themselves but as to dancing they could hardly help my learning countryances because they always wanted me to make up even number and on the other hand they were as heartily willing to learn me everything that they had been taught themselves as i could be to take the learning by this means i had as i have said above all the advantages of education that i could have had if i had been as much a gentlewoman as they were with whom i lived and in some things i had the advantage of my ladies though they were my superiors but they were all the gifts of nature and which all their fortunes could not furnish first i was apparently handsomer than any of them secondly i was better shaped and thirdly i sang better by which i mean i had a better voice in all which you will i hope allow me to say i do not speak my own conceit of myself but the opinion of all that knew the family i had with all these the common vanity of my sex viz that being really taken for very handsome or if you please for a great beauty i very well knew it and had as good an opinion of myself as anybody else could have of me and particularly i loved to hear anybody speak of it which could not but happen to me sometimes and was a great satisfaction to me thus far i have had a smooth story to tell of myself and in all this part of my life i not only had the reputation of living in a very good family and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and sobriety and for every valuable thing but i had the character too of a very sober modest and virtuous young woman and such i had always been neither had i yet any occasion to think of anything else or to know what a temptation to wickedness meant but that which i was too vain of was my ruin or rather my vanity was the cause of it the lady in the house where i was had two sons young gentlemen of very promising parts and of extraordinary behaviour and it was my misfortune to be very well with them both but they managed themselves with me in a quite different manner the eldest a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the country and though he had levity enough to do an illatured thing yet had too much judgment of things to pay too dear for his pleasures he began with the unhappy snare to all women viz taking notice upon all occasions how pretty i was as he called it how agreeable how wellarriaged and the like and this he contrived so subtly as if he had known as well how to catch a woman in his net as a partridge when he went aetting for he would contrive to be talking this to his sisters when though i was not by yet when he knew i was not far off but that i should be sure to hear him his sisters would return softly to him hush brother she will hear you she is but in the next room then he would put it off and talk softlier as if he had not known it and begin to acknowledge he was wrong and then as if he had forgot himself he would speak aloud again and i that was so well pleased to hear it was sure to listen for it upon all occasions after he had thus baited his hook and found easily enough the method how to lay it in my way he played an opener game and one day going by his sister s chamber when i was there doing something about dressing her he comes in with an air of gaiety oh mrs betty said he to me how do you do mrs betty don t your cheeks burn mrs betty i made a curtsy and blushed but said nothing what makes you talk so brother says the lady why says he we have been talking of her belowtairs this halfour well says his sister you can say no harm of her that i am sure so tis no matter what you have been talking about nay says he tis so far from talking harm of her that we have been talking a great deal of good and a great many fine things have been said of mrs betty i assure you and particularly that she is the handsomest young woman in colchester and in short they begin to toast her health in the town i wonder at you brother says the sister betty wants but one thing but she had as good want everything for the market is against our sex just now and if a young woman have beauty birth breeding wit sense manners modesty and all these to an extreme yet if she have not money she s nobody she had as good want them all for nothing but money now recommends a woman the men play the game all into their own hands her younger brother who was by cried hold sister you run too fast i am an exception to your rule i assure you if i find a woman so accomplished as you talk of i say i assure you i would not trouble myself about the money oh says the sister but you will take care not to fancy one then without the money you don t know that neither says the brother but why sister says the elder brother why do you exclaim so at the men for aiming so much at the fortune you are none of them that want a fortune whatever else you want i understand you brother replies the lady very smartly you suppose i have the money and want the beauty but as times go now the first will do without the last so i have the better of my neighbours well says the younger brother but your neighbours as you call them may be even with you for beauty will steal a husband sometimes in spite of money and when the maid chances to be handsomer than the mistress she oftentimes makes as good a market and rides in a coach before her i thought it was time for me to withdraw and leave them and i did so but not so far but that i heard all their discourse in which i heard abundance of the fine things said of myself which served to prompt my vanity but as i soon found was not the way to increase my interest in the family for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously out about it and as he said some very disobliging things to her upon my account so i could easily see that she resented them by her future conduct to me which indeed was very unjust to me for i had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother indeed the elder brother in his distant remote way had said a great many things as in jest which i had the folly to believe were in earnest or to flatter myself with the hopes of what i ought to have supposed he never intended and perhaps never thought of it happened one day that he came running upstairs towards the room where his sisters used to sit and work as he often used to do and calling to them before he came in as was his way too i being there alone stepped to the door and said sir the ladies are not here they are walked down the garden as i stepped forward to say this towards the door he was just got to the door and clasping me in his arms as if it had been by chance oh mrs betty says he are you here that s better still i want to speak with you more than i do with them and then having me in his arms he kissed me three or four times i struggled to get away and yet did it but faintly neither and he held me fast and still kissed me till he was almost out of breath and then sitting down says dear betty i am in love with you his words i must confess fired my blood all my spirits flew about my heart and put me into disorder enough which he might easily have seen in my face he repeated it afterwards several times that he was in love with me and my heart spoke as plain as a voice that i liked it nay whenever he said i am in love with you my blushes plainly replied would you were sir however nothing else passed at that time it was but a surprise and when he was gone i soon recovered myself again he had stayed longer with me but he happened to look out at the window and see his sisters coming up the garden so he took his leave kissed me again told me he was very serious and i should hear more of him very quickly and away he went leaving me infinitely pleased though surprised and had there not been one misfortune in it i had been in the right but the mistake lay here that mrs betty was in earnest and the gentleman was not from this time my head ran upon strange things and i may truly say i was not myself to have such a gentleman talk to me of being in love with me and of my being such a charming creature as he told me i was these were things i knew not how to bear my vanity was elevated to the last degree it is true i had my head full of pride but knowing nothing of the wickedness of the times i had not one thought of my own safety or of my virtue about me and had my young master offered it at first sight he might have taken any liberty he thought fit with me but he did not see his advantage which was my happiness for that time after this attack it was not long but he found an opportunity to catch me again and almost in the same posture indeed it had more of design in it on his part though not on my part it was thus the young ladies were all gone aisiting with their mother his brother was out of town and as for his father he had been in london for a week before he had so well watched me that he knew where i was though i did not so much as know that he was in the house and he briskly comes up the stairs and seeing me at work comes into the room to me directly and began just as he did before with taking me in his arms and kissing me for almost a quarter of an hour together it was his younger sister s chamber that i was in and as there was nobody in the house but the maids belowtairs he was it may be the ruder in short he began to be in earnest with me indeed perhaps he found me a little too easy for god knows i made no resistance to him while he only held me in his arms and kissed me indeed i was too well pleased with it to resist him much however as it were tired with that kind of work we sat down and there he talked with me a great while he said he was charmed with me and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how he was in love with me and if i was able to love him again and would make him happy i should be the saving of his life and many such fine things i said little to him again but easily discovered that i was a fool and that i did not in the least perceive what he meant then he walked about the room and taking me by the hand i walked with him and by and by taking his advantage he threw me down upon the bed and kissed me there most violently but to give him his due offered no manner of rudeness to me only kissed a great while after this he thought he had heard somebody come upstairs so got off from the bed lifted me up professing a great deal of love for me but told me it was all an honest affection and that he meant no ill to me and with that he put five guineas into my hand and went away downstairs i was more confounded with the money than i was before with the love and began to be so elevated that i scarce knew the ground i stood on i am the more particular in this part that if my story comes to be read by any innocent young body they may learn from it to guard themselves against the mischiefs which attend an early knowledge of their own beauty if a young woman once thinks herself handsome she never doubts the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her for if she believes herself charming enough to captivate him tis natural to expect the effects of it this young gentleman had fired his inclination as much as he had my vanity and as if he had found that he had an opportunity and was sorry he did not take hold of it he comes up again in half an hour or thereabouts and falls to work with me again as before only with a little less introduction and first when he entered the room he turned about and shut the door mrs betty said he i fancied before somebody was coming upstairs but it was not so however adds he if they find me in the room with you they shan t catch me aissing of you i told him i did not know who should be coming upstairs for i believed there was nobody in the house but the cook and the other maid and they never came up those stairs well my dear says he tis good to be sure however and so he sits down and we began to talk and now though i was still all on fire with his first visit and said little he did as it were put words in my mouth telling me how passionately he loved me and that though he could not mention such a thing till he came to this estate yet he was resolved to make me happy then and himself too that is to say to marry me and abundance of such fine things which i poor fool did not understand the drift of but acted as if there was no such thing as any kind of love but that which tended to matrimony and if he had spoke of that i had no room as well as no power to have said no but we were not come that length yet we had not sat long but he got up and stopping my very breath with kisses threw me upon the bed again but then being both well warmed he went farther with me than decency permits me to mention nor had it been in my power to have denied him at that moment had he offered much more than he did however though he took these freedoms with me it did not go to that which they call the last favour which to do him justice he did not attempt and he made that selfenial of his a plea for all his freedoms with me upon other occasions after this when this was over he stayed but a little while but he put almost a handful of gold in my hand and left me making a thousand protestations of his passion for me and of his loving me above all the women in the world it will not be strange if i now began to think but alas it was but with very little solid reflection i had a most unbounded stock of vanity and pride and but a very little stock of virtue i did indeed case sometimes with myself what young master aimed at but thought of nothing but the fine words and the gold whether he intended to marry me or not to marry me seemed a matter of no great consequence to me nor did my thoughts so much as suggest to me the necessity of making any capitulation for myself till he came to make a kind of formal proposal to me as you shall hear presently thus i gave up myself to a readiness of being ruined without the least concern and am a fair memento to all young women whose vanity prevails over their virtue nothing was ever so stupid on both sides had i acted as became me and resisted as virtue and honour require this gentleman had either desisted his attacks finding no room to expect the accomplishment of his design or had made fair and honourable proposals of marriage in which case whoever had blamed him nobody could have blamed me in short if he had known me and how easy the trifle he aimed at was to be had he would have troubled his head no farther but have given me four or five guineas and have lain with me the next time he had come at me and if i had known his thoughts and how hard he thought i would be to be gained i might have made my own terms with him and if i had not capitulated for an immediate marriage i might for a maintenance till marriage and might have had what i would for he was already rich to excess besides what he had in expectation but i seemed wholly to have abandoned all such thoughts as these and was taken up only with the pride of my beauty and of being beloved by such a gentleman as for the gold i spent whole hours in looking upon it i told the guineas over and over a thousand times a day never a poor vain creature was so wrapt up with every part of the story as i was not considering what was before me and how near my ruin was at the door indeed i think i rather wished for that ruin than studied to avoid it in the meantime however i was cunning enough not to give the least room to any in the family to suspect me or to imagine that i had the least correspondence with this young gentleman i scarce ever looked towards him in public or answered if he spoke to me when anybody was near us but for all that we had every now and then a little encounter where we had room for a word or two and now and then a kiss but no fair opportunity for the mischief intended and especially considering that he made more circumlocution than if he had known my thoughts he had occasion for and the work appearing difficult to him he really made it so but as the devil is an unwearied tempter so he never fails to find opportunity for that wickedness he invites to it was one evening that i was in the garden with his two younger sisters and himself and all very innocently merry when he found means to convey a note into my hand by which he directed me to understand that he would toorrow desire me publicly to go of an errand for him into the town and that i should see him somewhere by the way accordingly after dinner he very gravely says to me his sisters being all by mrs betty i must ask a favour of you what s that says his second sister nay sister says he very gravely if you can t spare mrs betty toay any other time will do yes they said they could spare her well enough and the sister begged pardon for asking which they did but of mere course without any meaning well but brother says the eldest sister you must tell mrs betty what it is if it be any private business that we must not hear you may call her out there she is why sister says the gentleman very gravely what do you mean i only desire her to go into the high street and then he pulls out a turnove to such a shop and then he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the turnover that he showed to see if they would take my money for the neckcloths to bid a shilling more and haggle with them and then he made more errands and so continued to have such petty business to do that i should be sure to stay a good while when he had given me my errands he told them a long story of a visit he was going to make to a family they all knew and where was to be suchnduch gentlemen and how merry they were to be and very formally asks his sisters to go with him and they as formally excused themselves because of company that they had notice was to come and visit them that afternoon which by the way he had contrived on purpose he had scarce done speaking to them and giving me my errand but his man came up to tell him that sir w h s coach stopped at the door so he runs down and comes up again immediately alas says he aloud there s all my mirth spoiled at once sir w has sent his coach for me and desires to speak with me upon some earnest business it seems this sir w was a gentleman who lived about three miles out of town to whom he had spoken on purpose the day before to lend him his chariot for a particular occasion and had appointed it to call for him as it did about three o clock immediately he calls for his best wig hat and sword and ordering his man to go to the other place to make his excuse that was to say he made an excuse to send his man away he prepares to go into the coach as he was going he stopped a while and speaks mighty earnestly to me about his business and finds an opportunity to say very softly to me come away my dear as soon as ever you can i said nothing but made a curtsy as if i had done so to what he said in public in about a quarter of an hour i went out too i had no dress other than before except that i had a hood a mask a fan and a pair of gloves in my pocket so that there was not the least suspicion in the house he waited for me in the coach in a backane which he knew i must pass by and had directed the coachman whither to go which was to a certain place called mile end where lived a confidant of his where we went in and where was all the convenience in the world to be as wicked as we pleased when we were together he began to talk very gravely to me and to tell me he did not bring me there to betray me that his passion for me would not suffer him to abuse me that he resolved to marry me as soon as he came to his estate that in the meantime if i would grant his request he would maintain me very honourably and made me a thousand protestations of his sincerity and of his affection to me and that he would never abandon me and as i may say made a thousand more preambles than he need to have done however as he pressed me to speak i told him i had no reason to question the sincerity of his love to me after so many protestations but and there i stopped as if i left him to guess the rest but what my dear says he i guess what you mean what if you should be with child is not that it why then says he i take care of you and provide for you and the child too and that you may see i am not in jest says he here s an earnest for you and with that he pulls out a silk purse with an hundred guineas in it and gave it me and i give you such another says he every year till i marry you my colour came and went at the sight of the purse and with the fire of his proposal together so that i could not say a word and he easily perceived it so putting the purse into my bosom i made no more resistance to him but let him do just what he pleased and as often as he pleased and thus i finished my own destruction at once for from this day being forsaken of my virtue and my modesty i had nothing of value left to recommend me either to god s blessing or man s assistance but things did not end here i went back to the town did the business he publicly directed me to and was at home before anybody thought me long as for my gentleman he stayed out as he told me he would till late at night and there was not the least suspicion in the family either on his account or on mine we had after this frequent opportunities to repeat our crime chiefly by his contrivance especially at home when his mother and the young ladies went abroad aisiting which he watched so narrowly as never to miss knowing always beforehand when they went out and then failed not to catch me all alone and securely enough so that we took our fill of our wicked pleasure for near half a year and yet which was the most to my satisfaction i was not with child but before this halfear was expired his younger brother of whom i have made some mention in the beginning of the story falls to work with me and he finding me alone in the garden one evening begins a story of the same kind to me made good honest professions of being in love with me and in short proposes fairly and honourably to marry me and that before he made any other offer to me at all i was now confounded and driven to such an extremity as the like was never known at least not to me i resisted the proposal with obstinacy and now i began to arm myself with arguments i laid before him the inequality of the match the treatment i should meet with in the family the ingratitude it would be to his good father and mother who had taken me into their house upon such generous principles and when i was in such a low condition and in short i said everything to dissuade him from his design that i could imagine except telling him the truth which would indeed have put an end to it all but that i durst not think of mentioning but here happened a circumstance that i did not expect indeed which put me to my shifts for this young gentleman as he was plain and honest so he pretended to nothing with me but what was so too and knowing his own innocence he was not so careful to make his having a kindness for mrs betty a secret in the house as his brother was and though he did not let them know that he had talked to me about it yet he said enough to let his sisters perceive he loved me and his mother saw it too which though they took no notice of it to me yet they did to him an immediately i found their carriage to me altered more than ever before i saw the cloud though i did not foresee the storm it was easy i say to see that their carriage to me was altered and that it grew worse and worse every day till at last i got information among the servants that i should in a very little while be desired to remove i was not alarmed at the news having a full satisfaction that i should be otherwise provided for and especially considering that i had reason every day to expect i should be with child and that then i should be obliged to remove without any pretences for it after some time the younger gentleman took an opportunity to tell me that the kindness he had for me had got vent in the family he did not charge me with it he said for he know well enough which way it came out he told me his plain way of talking had been the occasion of it for that he did not make his respect for me so much a secret as he might have done and the reason was that he was at a point that if i would consent to have him he would tell them all openly that he loved me and that he intended to marry me that it was true his father and mother might resent it and be unkind but that he was now in a way to live being bred to the law and he did not fear maintaining me agreeable to what i should expect and that in short as he believed i would not be ashamed of him so he was resolved not to be ashamed of me and that he scorned to be afraid to own me now whom he resolved to own after i was his wife and therefore i had nothing to do but to give him my hand and he would answer for all the rest i was now in a dreadful condition indeed and now i repented heartily my easiness with the eldest brother not from any reflection of conscience but from a view of the happiness i might have enjoyed and had now made impossible for though i had no great scruples of conscience as i have said to struggle with yet i could not think of being a whore to one brother and a wife to the other but then it came into my thoughts that the first brother had promised to made me his wife when he came to his estate but i presently remembered what i had often thought of that he had never spoken a word of having me for a wife after he had conquered me for a mistress and indeed till now though i said i thought of it often yet it gave me no disturbance at all for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his affection to me so neither did he lessen his bounty though he had the discretion himself to desire me not to lay out a penny of what he gave me in clothes or to make the least show extraordinary because it would necessarily give jealousy in the family since everybody know i could come at such things no manner of ordinary way but by some private friendship which they would presently have suspected but i was now in a great strait and knew not what to do the main difficulty was this the younger brother not only laid close siege to me but suffered it to be seen he would come into his sister s room and his mother s room and sit down and talk a thousand kind things of me and to me even before their faces and when they were all there this grew so public that the whole house talked of it and his mother reproved him for it and their carriage to me appeared quite altered in short his mother had let fall some speeches as if she intended to put me out of the family that is in english to turn me out of doors now i was sure this could not be a secret to his brother only that he might not think as indeed nobody else yet did that the youngest brother had made any proposal to me about it but as i easily could see that it would go farther so i saw likewise there was an absolute necessity to speak of it to him or that he would speak of it to me and which to do first i knew not that is whether i should break it to him or let it alone till he should break it to me upon serious consideration for indeed now i began to consider things very seriously and never till now i say upon serious consideration i resolved to tell him of it first and it was not long before i had an opportunity for the very next day his brother went to london upon some business and the family being out aisiting just as it had happened before and as indeed was often the case he came according to his custom to spend an hour or two with mrs betty when he came and had sat down a while he easily perceived there was an alteration in my countenance that i was not so free and pleasant with him as i used to be and particularly that i had been arying he was not long before he took notice of it and asked me in very kind terms what was the matter and if anything troubled me i would have put it off if i could but it was not to be concealed so after suffering many importunities to draw that out of me which i longed as much as possible to disclose i told him that it was true something did trouble me and something of such a nature that i could not conceal from him and yet that i could not tell how to tell him of it neither that it was a thing that not only surprised me but greatly perplexed me and that i knew not what course to take unless he would direct me he told me with great tenderness that let it be what it would i should not let it trouble me for he would protect me from all the world i then began at a distance and told him i was afraid the ladies had got some secret information of our correspondence for that it was easy to see that their conduct was very much changed towards me for a great while and that now it was come to that pass that they frequently found fault with me and sometimes fell quite out with me though i never gave them the least occasion that whereas i used always to lie with the eldest sister i was lately put to lie by myself or with one of the maids and that i had overheard them several times talking very unkindly about me but that which confirmed it all was that one of the servants had told me that she had heard i was to be turned out and that it was not safe for the family that i should be any longer in the house he smiled when he heard all this and i asked him how he could make so light of it when he must needs know that if there was any discovery i was undone for ever and that even it would hurt him though not ruin him as it would me i upbraided him that he was like all the rest of the sex that when they had the character and honour of a woman at their mercy oftentimes made it their jest and at least looked upon it as a trifle and counted the ruin of those they had had their will of as a thing of no value he saw me warm and serious and he changed his style immediately he told me he was sorry i should have such a thought of him that he had never given me the least occasion for it but had been as tender of my reputation as he could be of his own that he was sure our correspondence had been managed with so much address that not one creature in the family had so much as a suspicion of it that if he smiled when i told him my thoughts it was at the assurance he lately received that our understanding one another was not so much as known or guessed at and that when he had told me how much reason he had to be easy i should smile as he did for he was very certain it would give me a full satisfaction this is a mystery i cannot understand says i or how it should be to my satisfaction that i am to be turned out of doors for if our correspondence is not discovered i know not what else i have done to change the countenances of the whole family to me or to have them treat me as they do now who formerly used me with so much tenderness as if i had been one of their own children why look you child says he that they are uneasy about you that is true but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is and as it respects you and i is so far from being true that they suspect my brother robin and in short they are fully persuaded he makes love to you nay the fool has put it into their heads too himself for he is continually bantering them about it and making a jest of himself i confess i think he is wrong to do so because he cannot but see it vexes them and makes them unkind to you but tis a satisfaction to me because of the assurance it gives me that they do not suspect me in the least and i hope this will be to your satisfaction too so it is says i one way but this does not reach my case at all nor is this the chief thing that troubles me though i have been concerned about that too what is it then says he with which i fell to tears and could say nothing to him at all he strove to pacify me all he could but began at last to be very pressing upon me to tell what it was at last i answered that i thought i ought to tell him too and that he had some right to know it besides that i wanted his direction in the case for i was in such perplexity that i knew not what course to take and then i related the whole affair to him i told him how imprudently his brother had managed himself in making himself so public for that if he had kept it a secret as such a thing ought to have been i could but have denied him positively without giving any reason for it and he would in time have ceased his solicitations but that he had the vanity first to depend upon it that i would not deny him and then had taken the freedom to tell his resolution of having me to the whole house i told him how far i had resisted him and told him how sincere and honourable his offers were but says i my case will be doubly hard for as they carry it ill to me now because he desires to have me they carry it worse when they shall find i have denied him and they will presently say there s something else in it and then out it comes that i am married already to somebody else or that i would never refuse a match so much above me as this was this discourse surprised him indeed very much he told me that it was a critical point indeed for me to manage and he did not see which way i should get out of it but he would consider it and let me know next time we met what resolution he was come to about it and in the meantime desired i would not give my consent to his brother nor yet give him a flat denial but that i would hold him in suspense a while i seemed to start at his saying i should not give him my consent i told him he knew very well i had no consent to give that he had engaged himself to marry me and that my consent was the same time engaged to him that he had all along told me i was his wife and i looked upon myself as effectually so as if the ceremony had passed and that it was from his own mouth that i did so he having all along persuaded me to call myself his wife well my dear says he don t be concerned at that now if i am not your husband i be as good as a husband to you and do not let those things trouble you now but let me look a little farther into this affair and i shall be able to say more next time we meet he pacified me as well as he could with this but i found he was very thoughtful and that though he was very kind to me and kissed me a thousand times and more i believe and gave me money too yet he offered no more all the while we were together which was above two hours and which i much wondered at indeed at that time considering how it used to be and what opportunity we had his brother did not come from london for five or six days and it was two days more before he got an opportunity to talk with him but then getting him by himself he began to talk very close to him about it and the same evening got an opportunity for we had a long conference togethe to repeat all their discourse to me which as near as i can remember was to the purpose following he told him he heard strange news of him since he went viz that he made love to mrs betty well says his brother a little angrily and so i do and what then what has anybody to do with that nay says his brother don t be angry robin i don t pretend to have anything to do with it nor do i pretend to be angry with you about it but i find they do concern themselves about it and that they have used the poor girl ill about it which i should take as done to myself whom do you mean by they says robin i mean my mother and the girls says the elder brother but hark ye says his brother are you in earnest do you really love this girl you may be free with me you know why then says robin i will be free with you i do love her above all the women in the world and i will have her let them say and do what they will i believe the girl will not deny me it struck me to the heart when he told me this for though it was most rational to think i would not deny him yet i knew in my own conscience i must deny him and i saw my ruin in my being obliged to do so but i knew it was my business to talk otherwise then so i interrupted him in his story thus ay said i does he think i cannot deny him but he shall find i can deny him for all that well my dear says he but let me give you the whole story as it went on between us and then say what you will then he went on and told me that he replied thus but brother you know she has nothing and you may have several ladies with good fortunes tis no matter for that said robin i love the girl and i will never please my pocket in marrying and not please my fancy and so my dear adds he there is no opposing him yes yes says i you shall see i can oppose him i have learnt to say no now though i had not learnt it before if the best lord in the land offered me marriage now i could very cheerfully say no to him well but my dear says he what can you say to him you know as you said when we talked of it before he will ask you many questions about it and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should be why says i smiling i can stop all their mouths at one clap by telling him and them too that i am married already to his elder brother he smiled a little too at the word but i could see it startled him and he could not hide the disorder it put him into however he returned why though that may be true in some sense yet i suppose you are but in jest when you talk of giving such an answer as that it may not be convenient on many accounts no no says i pleasantly i am not so fond of letting the secret come out without your consent but what then can you say to him or to them says he when they find you positive against a match which would be apparently so much to your advantage why says i should i be at a loss first of all i am not obliged to give me any reason at all on the other hand i may tell them i am married already and stop there and that will be a full stop too to him for he can have no reason to ask one question after it ay says he but the whole house will tease you about that even to father and mother and if you deny them positively they will be disobliged at you and suspicious besides why says i what can i do what would you have me do i was in straight enough before and as i told you i was in perplexity before and acquainted you with the circumstances that i might have your advice my dear says he i have been considering very much upon it you may be sure and though it is a piece of advice that has a great many mortifications in it to me and may at first seem strange to you yet all things considered i see no better way for you than to let him go on and if you find him hearty and in earnest marry him i gave him a look full of horror at those words and turning pale as death was at the very point of sinking down out of the chair i sat in when giving a start my dear says he aloud what s the matter with you where are you aoing and a great many such things and with jogging and called to me fetched me a little to myself though it was a good while before i fully recovered my senses and was not able to speak for several minutes more when i was fully recovered he began again my dear says he what made you so surprised at what i said i would have you consider seriously of it you may see plainly how the family stand in this case and they would be stark mad if it was my case as it is my brother s and for aught i see it would be my ruin and yours too ay says i still speaking angrily are all your protestations and vows to be shaken by the dislike of the family did i not always object that to you and you made light thing of it as what you were above and would value and is it come to this now said i is this your faith and honour your love and the solidity of your promises he continued perfectly calm notwithstanding all my reproaches and i was not sparing of them at all but he replied at last my dear i have not broken one promise with you yet i did tell you i would marry you when i was come to my estate but you see my father is a hale healthy man and may live these thirty years still and not be older than several are round us in town and you never proposed my marrying you sooner because you knew it might be my ruin and as to all the rest i have not failed you in anything you have wanted for nothing i could not deny a word of this and had nothing to say to it in general but why then says i can you persuade me to such a horrid step as leaving you since you have not left me will you allow no affection no love on my side where there has been so much on your side have i made you no returns have i given no testimony of my sincerity and of my passion are the sacrifices i have made of honour and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken but here my dear says he you may come into a safe station and appear with honour and with splendour at once and the remembrance of what we have done may be wrapt up in an eternal silence as if it had never happened you shall always have my respect and my sincere affection only then it shall be honest and perfectly just to my brother you shall be my dear sister as now you are my dear and there he stopped your dear whore says i you would have said if you had gone on and you might as well have said it but i understand you however i desire you to remember the long discourses you have had with me and the many hours pains you have taken to persuade me to believe myself an honest woman that i was your wife intentionally though not in the eyes of the world and that it was as effectual a marriage that had passed between us as if we had been publicly wedded by the parson of the parish you know and cannot but remember that these have been your own words to me i found this was a little too close upon him but i made it up in what follows he stood stocktill for a while and said nothing and i went on thus you cannot says i without the highest injustice believe that i yielded upon all these persuasions without a love not to be questioned not to be shaken again by anything that could happen afterward if you have such dishonourable thoughts of me i must ask you what foundation in any of my behaviour have i given for such a suggestion if then i have yielded to the importunities of my affection and if i have been persuaded to believe that i am really and in the essence of the thing your wife shall i now give the lie to all those arguments and call myself your whore or mistress which is the same thing and will you transfer me to your brother can you transfer my affection can you bid me cease loving you and bid me love him it is in my power think you to make such a change at demand no sir said i depend upon it tis impossible and whatever the change of your side may be i will ever be true and i had much rather since it is come that unhappy length be your whore than your brother s wife he appeared pleased and touched with the impression of this last discourse and told me that he stood where he did before that he had not been unfaithful to me in any one promise he had ever made yet but that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his view in the affair before me and that on my account in particular that he had thought of the other as a remedy so effectual as nothing could come up to it that he thought this would not be entire parting us but we might love as friends all our days and perhaps with more satisfaction than we should in the station we were now in as things might happen that he durst say i could not apprehend anything from him as to betraying a secret which could not but be the destruction of us both if it came out that he had but one question to ask of me that could lie in the way of it and if that question was answered in the negative he could not but think still it was the only step i could take i guessed at his question presently namely whether i was sure i was not with child as to that i told him he need not be concerned about it for i was not with child why then my dear says he we have no time to talk further now consider of it and think closely about it i cannot but be of the opinion still that it will be the best course you can take and with this he took his leave and the more hastily too his mother and sisters ringing at the gate just at the moment that he had risen up to go he left me in the utmost confusion of thought and he easily perceived it the next day and all the rest of the week for it was but tuesday evening when we talked but he had no opportunity to come at me all that week till the sunday after when i being indisposed did not go to church and he making some excuse for the like stayed at home and now he had me an hour and a half again by myself and we fell into the same arguments all over again or at least so near the same as it would be to no purpose to repeat them at last i asked him warmly what opinion he must have of my modesty that he could suppose i should so much as entertain a thought of lying with two brothers and assured him it could never be i added if he was to tell me that he would never see me more than which nothing but death could be more terrible yet i could never entertain a thought so dishonourable to myself and so base to him and therefore i entreated him if he had one grain of respect or affection left for me that he would speak no more of it to me or that he would pull his sword out and kill me he appeared surprised at my obstinacy as he called it told me i was unkind to myself and unkind to him in it that it was a crisis unlooked for upon us both and impossible for either of us to foresee but that he did not see any other way to save us both from ruin and therefore he thought it the more unkind but that if he must say no more of it to me he added with an unusual coldness that he did not know anything else we had to talk of and so he rose up to take his leave i rose up too as if with the same indifference but when he came to give me as it were a parting kiss i burst out into such a passion of crying that though i would have spoke i could not and only pressing his hand seemed to give him the adieu but cried vehemently he was sensibly moved with this so he sat down again and said a great many kind things to me to abate the excess of my passion but still urged the necessity of what he had proposed all the while insisting that if i did refuse he would notwithstanding provide for me but letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main point nay even as a mistress making it a point of honour not to lie with the woman that for aught he knew might come to be his brother s wife the bare loss of him as a gallant was not so much my affliction as the loss of his person whom indeed i loved to distraction and the loss of all the expectations i had and which i always had built my hopes upon of having him one day for my husband these things oppressed my mind so much that in short i fell very ill the agonies of my mind in a word threw me into a high fever and long it was that none in the family expected my life i was reduced very low indeed and was often delirious and lighteaded but nothing lay so near me as the fear that when i was lighteaded i should say something or other to his prejudice i was distressed in my mind also to see him and so he was to see me for he really loved me most passionately but it could not be there was not the least room to desire it on one side or other or so much as to make it decent it was near five weeks that i kept my bed and though the violence of my fever abated in three weeks yet it several times returned and the physicians said two or three times they could do no more for me but that they must leave nature and the distemper to fight it out only strengthening the first with cordials to maintain the struggle after the end of five weeks i grew better but was so weak so altered so melancholy and recovered so slowly that the physicians apprehended i should go into a consumption and which vexed me most they gave it as their opinion that my mind was oppressed that something troubled me and in short that i was in love upon this the whole house was set upon me to examine me and to press me to tell whether i was in love or not and with whom but as i well might i denied my being in love at all they had on this occasion a squabble one day about me at table that had like to have put the whole family in an uproar and for some time did so they happened to be all at table but the father as for me i was ill and in my chamber at the beginning of the talk which was just as they had finished their dinner the old gentlewoman who had sent me somewhat to eat called her maid to go up and ask me if i would have any more but the maid brought down word i had not eaten half what she had sent me already alas says the old lady that poor girl i am afraid she will never be well well says the elder brother how should mrs betty be well they say she is in love i believe nothing of it says the old gentlewoman i don t know says the eldest sister what to say to it they have made such a rout about her being so handsome and so charming and i know not what and that in her hearing too that has turned the creature s head i believe and who knows what possessions may follow such doings for my part i don t know what to make of it why sister you must acknowledge she is very handsome says the elder brother ay and a great deal handsomer than you sister says robin and that s your mortification well well that is not the question says his sister that girl is well enough and she knows it well enough she need not be told of it to make her vain we are not talking of her being vain says the elder brother but of her being in love it may be she is in love with herself it seems my sisters think so i would she was in love with me says robin i quickly put her out of her pain what ye mean by that son says the old lady how can you talk so why madam says robin again very honestly do you think i let the poor girl die for love and of one that is near at hand to be had too fie brother says the second sister how can you talk so would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world prithee child says robin beauty s a portion and goodumour with it is a double portion i wish thou hadst half her stock of both for thy portion so there was her mouth stopped i find says the eldest sister if betty is not in love my brother is i wonder he has not broke his mind to betty i warrant she won t say no they that yield when they re asked says robin are one step before them that were never asked to yield sister and two steps before them that yield before they are asked and that s an answer to you sister this fired the sister and she flew into a passion and said things were come to that pass that it was time the wench meaning me was out of the family and but that she was not fit to be turned out she hoped her father and mother would consider of it as soon as she could be removed robin replied that was business for the master and mistress of the family who where not to be taught by one that had so little judgment as his eldest sister it ran up a great deal farther the sister scolded robin rallied and bantered but poor betty lost ground by it extremely in the family i heard of it and i cried heartily and the old lady came up to me somebody having told her that i was so much concerned about it i complained to her that it was very hard the doctors should pass such a censure upon me for which they had no ground and that it was still harder considering the circumstances i was under in the family that i hoped i had done nothing to lessen her esteem for me or given any occasion for the bickering between her sons and daughters and i had more need to think of a coffin than of being in love and begged she would not let me suffer in her opinion for anybody s mistakes but my own she was sensible of the justice of what i said but told me since there had been such a clamour among them and that her younger son talked after such a rattling way as he did she desired i would be so faithful to her as to answer her but one question sincerely i told her i would with all my heart and with the utmost plainness and sincerity why then the question was whether there was anything between her son robert and me i told her with all the protestations of sincerity that i was able to make and as i might well do that there was not nor ever had been i told her that mr robert had rattled and jested as she knew it was his way and that i took it always as i supposed he meant it to be a wild airy way of discourse that had no signification in it and again assured her that there was not the least tittle of what she understood by it between us and that those who had suggested it had done me a great deal of wrong and mr robert no service at all the old lady was fully satisfied and kissed me spoke cheerfully to me and bid me take care of my health and want for nothing and so took her leave but when she came down she found the brother and all his sisters together by the ears they were angry even to passion at his upbraiding them with their being homely and having never had any sweethearts never having been asked the question and their being so forward as almost to ask first he rallied them upon the subject of mrs betty how pretty how goodumoured how she sung better than they did and danced better and how much handsomer she was and in doing this he omitted no illatured thing that could vex them and indeed pushed too hard upon them the old lady came down in the height of it and to put a stop it to told them all the discourse she had had with me and how i answered that there was nothing between mr robert and i she s wrong there says robin for if there was not a great deal between us we should be closer together than we are i told her i loved her hugely says he but i could never make the jade believe i was in earnest i do not know how you should says his mother nobody in their senses could believe you were in earnest to talk so to a poor girl whose circumstances you know so well but prithee son adds she since you tell me that you could not make her believe you were in earnest what must we believe about it for you ramble so in your discourse that nobody knows whether you are in earnest or in jest but as i find the girl by your own confession has answered truly i wish you would do so too and tell me seriously so that i may depend upon it is there anything in it or no are you in earnest or no are you distracted indeed or are you not tis a weighty question and i wish you would make us easy about it by my faith madam says robin tis in vain to mince the matter or tell any more lies about it i am in earnest as much as a man is that s going to be hanged if mrs betty would say she loved me and that she would marry me i have her tomorrow morning fasting and say to have and to hold instead of eating my breakfast well says the mother then there s one son lost and she said it in a very mournful tone as one greatly concerned at it i hope not madam says robin no man is lost when a good wife has found him why but child says the old lady she is a beggar why then madam she has the more need of charity says robin i take her off the hands of the parish and she and i beg together it s bad jesting with such things says the mother i don t jest madam says robin we come and beg your pardon madam and your blessing madam and my father s this is all out of the way son says the mother if you are in earnest you are undone i am afraid not says he for i am really afraid she won t have me after all my sister s huffing and blustering i believe i shall never be able to persuade her to it that s a fine tale indeed she is not so far out of her senses neither mrs betty is no fool says the younger sister do you think she has learnt to say no any more than other people no mrs mirthit says robin mrs betty s no fool but mrs betty may be engaged some other way and what then nay says the eldest sister we can say nothing to that who must it be to then she is never out of the doors it must be between you i have nothing to say to that says robin i have been examined enough there s my brother if it must be between us go to work with him this stung the elder brother to the quick and he concluded that robin had discovered something however he kept himself from appearing disturbed prithee says he don t go to shame your stories off upon me i tell you i deal in no such ware i have nothing to say to mrs betty nor to any of the mrs bettys in the parish and with that he rose up and brushed off no says the eldest sister i dare answer for my brother he knows the world better thus the discourse ended but it left the elder brother quite confounded he concluded his brother had made a full discovery and he began to doubt whether i had been concerned in it or not but with all his management he could not bring it about to get at me at last he was so perplexed that he was quite desperate and resolved he would come into my chamber and see me whatever came of it in order to do this he contrived it so that one day after dinner watching his eldest sister till he could see her go upstairs he runs after her hark ye sister says he where is this sick woman may not a body see her yes says the sister i believe you may but let me go first a little and i tell you so she ran up to the door and gave me notice and presently called to him again brother says she you may come if you please so in he came just in the same kind of rant well says he at the door as he came in where is this sick body that s in love how do ye do mrs betty i would have got up out of my chair but was so weak i could not for a good while and he saw it and his sister too and she said come do not strive to stand up my brother desires no ceremony especially now you are so weak no no mrs betty pray sit still says he and so sits himself down in a chair over against me and appeared as if he was mighty merry he talked a lot of rambling stuff to his sister and to me sometimes of one thing sometimes of another on purpose to amuse his sister and every now and then would turn it upon the old story directing it to me poor mrs betty says he it is a sad thing to be in love why it has reduced you sadly at last i spoke a little i am glad to see you so merry sir says i but i think the doctor might have found something better to do than to make his game at his patients if i had been ill of no other distemper i know the proverb too well to have let him come to me what proverb says he oh i remember it now what where love is the case the doctor s an ass is not that it mrs betty i smiled and said nothing nay says he i think the effect has proved it to be love for it seems the doctor has been able to do you but little service you mend very slowly they say i doubt there s somewhat in it mrs betty i doubt you are sick of the incurables and that is love i smiled and said no indeed sir that s none of my distemper we had a deal of such discourse and sometimes others that signified as little by and by he asked me to sing them a song at which i smiled and said my singing days were over at last he asked me if he should play upon his flute to me his sister said she believe it would hurt me and that my head could not bear it i bowed and said no it would not hurt me and pray madam said i do not hinder it i love the music of the flute very much then his sister said well do then brother with that he pulled out the key of his closet dear sister says he i am very lazy do step to my closet and fetch my flute it lies in such a drawer naming a place where he was sure it was not that she might be a little while aooking for it as soon as she was gone he related the whole story to me of the discourse his brother had about me and of his pushing it at him and his concern about it which was the reason of his contriving this visit to me i assured him i had never opened my mouth either to his brother or to anybody else i told him the dreadful exigence i was in that my love to him and his offering to have me forget that affection and remove it to another had thrown me down and that i had a thousand times wished i might die rather than recover and to have the same circumstances to struggle with as i had before and that his backwardness to life had been the great reason of the slowness of my recovering i added that i foresaw that as soon as i was well i must quit the family and that as for marrying his brother i abhorred the thoughts of it after what had been my case with him and that he might depend upon it i would never see his brother again upon that subject that if he would break all his vows and oaths and engagements with me be that between his conscience and his honour and himself but he should never be able to say that i whom he had persuaded to call myself his wife and who had given him the liberty to use me as a wife was not as faithful to him as a wife ought to be whatever he might be to me he was going to reply and had said that he was sorry i could not be persuaded and was aoing to say more but he heard his sister aoming and so did i and yet i forced out these few words as a reply that i could never be persuaded to love one brother and marry another he shook his head and said then i am ruined meaning himself and that moment his sister entered the room and told him she could not find the flute well says he merrily this laziness won t do so he gets up and goes himself to go to look for it but comes back without it too not but that he could have found it but because his mind was a little disturbed and he had no mind to play and besides the errand he sent his sister on was answered another way for he only wanted an opportunity to speak to me which he gained though not much to his satisfaction i had however a great deal of satisfaction in having spoken my mind to him with freedom and with such an honest plainness as i have related and though it did not at all work the way i desired that is to say to oblige the person to me the more yet it took from him all possibility of quitting me but by a downright breach of honour and giving up all the faith of a gentleman to me which he had so often engaged by never to abandon me but to make me his wife as soon as he came to his estate it was not many weeks after this before i was about the house again and began to grow well but i continued melancholy silent dull and retired which amazed the whole family except he that knew the reason of it yet it was a great while before he took any notice of it and i as backward to speak as he carried respectfully to him but never offered to speak a word to him that was particular of any kind whatsoever and this continued for sixteen or seventeen weeks so that as i expected every day to be dismissed the family on account of what distaste they had taken another way in which i had no guilt so i expected to hear no more of this gentleman after all his solemn vows and protestations but to be ruined and abandoned at last i broke the way myself in the family for my removing for being talking seriously with the old lady one day about my own circumstances in the world and how my distemper had left a heaviness upon my spirits that i was not the same thing i was before the old lady said i am afraid betty what i have said to you about my son has had some influence upon you and that you are melancholy on his account pray will you let me know how the matter stands with you both if it may not be improper for as for robin he does nothing but rally and banter when i speak of it to him why truly madam said i that matter stands as i wish it did not and i shall be very sincere with you in it whatever befalls me for it mr robert has several times proposed marriage to me which is what i had no reason to expect my poor circumstances considered but i have always resisted him and that perhaps in terms more positive than became me considering the regard that i ought to have for every branch of your family but said i madam i could never so far forget my obligation to you and all your house to offer to consent to a thing which i know must needs be disobliging to you and this i have made my argument to him and have positively told him that i would never entertain a thought of that kind unless i had your consent and his father s also to whom i was bound by so many invincible obligations and is this possible mrs betty says the old lady then you have been much juster to us than we have been to you for we have all looked upon you as a kind of snare to my son and i had a proposal to make to you for your removing for fear of it but i had not yet mentioned it to you because i thought you were not thorough well and i was afraid of grieving you too much lest it should throw you down again for we have all a respect for you still though not so much as to have it be the ruin of my son but if it be as you say we have all wronged you very much as to the truth of what i say madam said i refer you to your son himself if he will do me any justice he must tell you the story just as i have told it away goes the old lady to her daughters and tells them the whole story just as i had told it her and they were surprised at it you may be sure as i believed they would be one said she could never have thought it another said robin was a fool a third said she would not believe a word of it and she would warrant that robin would tell the story another way but the old gentlewoman who was resolved to go to the bottom of it before i could have the least opportunity of acquainting her son with what had passed resolved too that she would talk with her son immediately and to that purpose sent for him for he was gone but to a lawyer s house in the town upon some petty business of his own and upon her sending he returned immediately upon his coming up to them for they were all still together sit down robin says the old lady i must have some talk with you with all my heart madam says robin looking very merry i hope it is about a good wife for i am at a great loss in that affair how can that be says his mother did not you say you resolved to have mrs betty ay madam says robin but there is one has forbid the banns forbid the banns says his mother who can that be even mrs betty herself says robin how so says his mother have you asked her the question then yes indeed madam says robin i have attacked her in form five times since she was sick and am beaten off the jade is so stout she won t capitulate nor yield upon any terms except such as i cannot effectually grant explain yourself says the mother for i am surprised i do not understand you i hope you are not in earnest why madam says he the case is plain enough upon me it explains itself she won t have me she says is not that plain enough i think tis plain and pretty rough too well but says the mother you talk of conditions that you cannot grant what does she want a settlement her jointure ought to be according to her portion but what fortune does she bring you nay as to fortune says robin she is rich enough i am satisfied in that point but tis i that am not able to come up to her terms and she is positive she will not have me without here the sisters put in madam says the second sister tis impossible to be serious with him he will never give a direct answer to anything you had better let him alone and talk no more of it to him you know how to dispose of her out of his way if you thought there was anything in it robin was a little warmed with his sister s rudeness but he was even with her and yet with good manners too there are two sorts of people madam says he turning to his mother that there is no contending with that is a wise body and a fool tis a little hard i should engage with both of them together the younger sister then put in we must be fools indeed says she in my brother s opinion that he should think we can believe he has seriously asked mrs betty to marry him and that she has refused him answer and answer not say solomon replied her brother when your brother had said to your mother that he had asked her no less than five times and that it was so that she positively denied him methinks a younger sister need not question the truth of it when her mother did not my mother you see did not understand it says the second sister there s some difference says robin between desiring me to explain it and telling me she did not believe it well but son says the old lady if you are disposed to let us into the mystery of it what were these hard conditions yes madam says robin i had done it before now if the teasers here had not worried me by way of interruption the conditions are that i bring my father and you to consent to it and without that she protests she will never see me more upon that head and to these conditions as i said i suppose i shall never be able to grant i hope my warm sisters will be answered now and blush a little if not i have no more to say till i hear further this answer was surprising to them all though less to the mother because of what i had said to her as to the daughters they stood mute a great while but the mother said with some passion well i had heard this before but i could not believe it but if it is so then we have all done betty wrong and she has behaved better than i ever expected nay says the eldest sister if it be so she has acted handsomely indeed i confess says the mother it was none of her fault if he was fool enough to take a fancy to her but to give such an answer to him shows more respect to your father and me than i can tell how to express i shall value the girl the better for it as long as i know her but i shall not says robin unless you will give your consent i consider of that a while says the mother i assure you if there were not some other objections in the way this conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to consent i wish it would go quite through it says robin if you had as much thought about making me easy as you have about making me rich you would soon consent to it why robin says the mother again are you really in earnest would you so fain have her as you pretend really madam says robin i think tis hard you should question me upon that head after all i have said i won t say that i will have her how can i resolve that point when you see i cannot have her without your consent besides i am not bound to marry at all but this i will say i am in earnest in that i will never have anybody else if i can help it so you may determine for me betty or nobody is the word and the question which of the two shall be in your breast to decide madam provided only that my goodumoured sisters here may have no vote in it all this was dreadful to me for the mother began to yield and robin pressed her home on it on the other hand she advised with the eldest son and he used all the arguments in the world to persuade her to consent alleging his brother s passionate love for me and my generous regard to the family in refusing my own advantages upon such a nice point of honour and a thousand such things and as to the father he was a man in a hurry of public affairs and getting money seldom at home thoughtful of the main chance but left all those things to his wife you may easily believe that when the plot was thus as they thought broke out and that every one thought they knew how things were carried it was not so difficult or so dangerous for the elder brother whom nobody suspected of anything to have a freer access to me than before nay the mother which was just as he wished proposed it to him to talk with mrs betty for it may be son said she you may see farther into the thing than i and see if you think she has been so positive as robin says she has been or no this was as well as he could wish and he as it were yielding to talk with me at his mother s request she brought me to him into her own chamber told me her son had some business with me at her request and desired me to be very sincere with him and then she left us together and he went and shut the door after her he came back to me and took me in his arms and kissed me very tenderly but told me he had a long discourse to hold with me and it was not come to that crisis that i should make myself happy or miserable as long as i lived that the thing was now gone so far that if i could not comply with his desire we would both be ruined then he told the whole story between robin as he called him and his mother and sisters and himself as it is above and now dear child says he consider what it will be to marry a gentleman of a good family in good circumstances and with the consent of the whole house and to enjoy all that the world can give you and what on the other hand to be sunk into the dark circumstances of a woman that has lost her reputation and that though i shall be a private friend to you while i live yet as i shall be suspected always so you will be afraid to see me and i shall be afraid to own you he gave me no time to reply but went on with me thus what has happened between us child so long as we both agree to do so may be buried and forgotten i shall always be your sincere friend without any inclination to nearer intimacy when you become my sister and we shall have all the honest part of conversation without any reproaches between us of having done amiss i beg of you to consider it and to not stand in the way of your own safety and prosperity and to satisfy you that i am sincere added he i here offer you in money to make you some amends for the freedoms i have taken with you which we shall look upon as some of the follies of our lives which tis hoped we may repent of he spoke this in so much more moving terms than it is possible for me to express and with so much greater force of argument than i can repeat that i only recommend it to those who read the story to suppose that as he held me above an hour and a half in that discourse so he answered all my objections and fortified his discourse with all the arguments that human wit and art could devise i cannot say however that anything he said made impression enough upon me so as to give me any thought of the matter till he told me at last very plainly that if i refused he was sorry to add that he could never go on with me in that station as we stood before that though he loved me as well as ever and that i was as agreeable to him as ever yet sense of virtue had not so far forsaken him as to suffer him to lie with a woman that his brother courted to make his wife and if he took his leave of me with a denial in this affair whatever he might do for me in the point of support grounded on his first engagement of maintaining me yet he would not have me be surprised that he was obliged to tell me he could not allow himself to see me any more and that indeed i could not expect it of him i received this last part with some token of surprise and disorder and had much ado to avoid sinking down for indeed i loved him to an extravagance not easy to imagine but he perceived my disorder he entreated me to consider seriously of it assured me that it was the only way to preserve our mutual affection that in this station we might love as friends with the utmost passion and with a love of relation untainted free from our just reproaches and free from other people s suspicions that he should ever acknowledge his happiness owing to me that he would be debtor to me as long as he lived and would be paying that debt as long as he had breath thus he wrought me up in short to a kind of hesitation in the matter having the dangers on one side represented in lively figures and indeed heightened by my imagination of being turned out to the wide world a mere castff whore for it was no less and perhaps exposed as such with little to provide for myself with no friend no acquaintance in the whole world out of that town and there i could not pretend to stay all this terrified me to the last degree and he took care upon all occasions to lay it home to me in the worst colours that it could be possible to be drawn in on the other hand he failed not to set forth the easy prosperous life which i was going to live he answered all that i could object from affection and from former engagements with telling me the necessity that was before us of taking other measures now and as to his promises of marriage the nature of things he said had put an end to that by the probability of my being his brother s wife before the time to which his promises all referred thus in a word i may say he reasoned me out of my reason he conquered all my arguments and i began to see a danger that i was in which i had not considered of before and that was of being dropped by both of them and left alone in the world to shift for myself this and his persuasion at length prevailed with me to consent though with so much reluctance that it was easy to see i should go to church like a bear to the stake i had some little apprehensions about me too lest my new spouse who by the way i had not the least affection for should be skillful enough to challenge me on another account upon our first coming to bed together but whether he did it with design or not i know not but his elder brother took care to make him very much fuddled before he went to bed so that i had the satisfaction of a drunken bedfellow the first night how he did it i know not but i concluded that he certainly contrived it that his brother might be able to make no judgment of the difference between a maid and a married woman nor did he ever entertain any notions of it or disturb his thoughts about it i should go back a little here to where i left off the elder brother having thus managed me his next business was to manage his mother and he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce and be passive in the thing even without acquainting the father other than by post letters so that she consented to our marrying privately and leaving her to manage the father afterwards then he cajoled with his brother and persuaded him what service he had done him and how he had brought his mother to consent which though true was not indeed done to serve him but to serve himself but thus diligently did he cheat him and had the thanks of a faithful friend for shifting off his whore into his brother s arms for a wife so certainly does interest banish all manner of affection and so naturally do men give up honour and justice humanity and even christianity to secure themselves i must now come back to brother robin as we always called him who having got his mother s consent as above came big with the news to me and told me the whole story of it with a sincerity so visible that i must confess it grieved me that i must be the instrument to abuse so honest a gentleman but there was no remedy he would have me and i was not obliged to tell him that i was his brother s whore though i had no other way to put him off so i came gradually into it to his satisfaction and behold we were married modesty forbids me to reveal the secrets of the marriageed but nothing could have happened more suitable to my circumstances than that as above my husband was so fuddled when he came to bed that he could not remember in the morning whether he had had any conversation with me or no and i was obliged to tell him he had though in reality he had not that i might be sure he could make to inquiry about anything else it concerns the story in hand very little to enter into the further particulars of the family or of myself for the five years that i lived with this husband only to observe that i had two children by him and that at the end of five years he died he had been really a very good husband to me and we lived very agreeably together but as he had not received much from them and had in the little time he lived acquired no great matters so my circumstances were not great nor was i much mended by the match indeed i had preserved the elder brother s bonds to me to pay which he offered me for my consent to marry his brother and this with what i had saved of the money he formerly gave me about as much more by my husband left me a widow with about in my pocket my two children were indeed taken happily off my hands by my husband s father and mother and that by the way was all they got by mrs betty i confess i was not suitably affected with the loss of my husband nor indeed can i say that i ever loved him as i ought to have done or as was proportionable to the good usage i had from him for he was a tender kind goodumoured man as any woman could desire but his brother being so always in my sight at least while we were in the country was a continual snare to me and i never was in bed with my husband but i wished myself in the arms of his brother and though his brother never offered me the least kindness that way after our marriage but carried it just as a brother ought to do yet it was impossible for me to do so to him in short i committed adultery and incest with him every day in my desires which without doubt was as effectually criminal in the nature of the guilt as if i had actually done it before my husband died his elder brother was married and we being then removed to london were written to by the old lady to come and be at the wedding my husband went but i pretended indisposition and that i could not possibly travel so i stayed behind for in short i could not bear the sight of his being given to another woman though i knew i was never to have him myself i was now as above left loose to the world and being still young and handsome as everybody said of me and i assure you i thought myself so and with a tolerable fortune in my pocket i put no small value upon myself i was courted by several very considerable tradesmen and particularly very warmly by one a linenraper at whose house after my husband s death i took a lodging his sister being my acquaintance here i had all the liberty and all the opportunity to be gay and appear in company that i could desire my landlord s sister being one of the maddest gayest things alive and not so much mistress of her virtue as i thought at first she had been she brought me into a world of wild company and even brought home several persons such as she liked well enough to gratify to see her pretty widow so she was pleased to call me and that name i got in a little time in public now as fame and fools make an assembly i was here wonderfully caressed had abundance of admirers and such as called themselves lovers but i found not one fair proposal among them all as for their common design that i understood too well to be drawn into any more snares of that kind the case was altered with me i had money in my pocket and had nothing to say to them i had been tricked once by that cheat called love but the game was over i was resolved now to be married or nothing and to be well married or not at all i loved the company indeed of men of mirth and wit men of gallantry and figure and was often entertained with such as i was also with others but i found by just observation that the brightest men came upon the dullest errand that is to say the dullest as to what i aimed at on the other hand those who came with the best proposals were the dullest and most disagreeable part of the world i was not averse to a tradesman but then i would have a tradesman forsooth that was something of a gentleman too that when my husband had a mind to carry me to the court or to the play he might become a sword and look as like a gentleman as another man and not be one that had the mark of his aprontrings upon his coat or the mark of his hat upon his periwig that should look as if he was set on to his sword when his sword was put on to him and that carried his trade in his countenance well at last i found this amphibious creature this landater thing called a gentlemanradesman and as a just plague upon my folly i was catched in the very snare which as i might say i laid for myself i said for myself for i was not trepanned i confess but i betrayed myself this was a draper too for though my comrade would have brought me to a bargain with her brother yet when it came to the point it was it seems for a mistress not a wife and i kept true to this notion that a woman should never be kept for a mistress that had money to keep herself thus my pride not my principle my money not my virtue kept me honest though as it proved i found i had much better have been sold by my sheomrade to her brother than have sold myself as i did to a tradesman that was rake gentleman shopkeeper and beggar all together but i was hurried on by my fancy to a gentlema to ruin myself in the grossest manner that every woman did for my new husband coming to a lump of money at once fell into such a profusion of expense that all i had and all he had before if he had anything worth mentioning would not have held it out above one year he was very fond of me for about a quarter of a year and what i got by that was that i had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of my money spent upon myself and as i may say had some of the spending it too come my dear says he to me one day shall we go and take a turn into the country for about a week ay my dear says i whither would you go i care not whither says he but i have a mind to look like quality for a week we go to oxford says he how says i shall we go i am no horsewoman and tis too far for a coach too far says he no place is too far for a coachndix if i carry you out you shall travel like a duchess hum says i my dear tis a frolic but if you have a mind to it i don t care well the time was appointed we had a rich coach very good horses a coachman postillion and two footmen in very good liveries a gentleman on horseback and a page with a feather in his hat upon another horse the servants all called him my lord and the inneepers you may be sure did the like and i was her honour the countess and thus we traveled to oxford and a very pleasant journey we had for give him his due not a beggar alive knew better how to be a lord than my husband we saw all the rarities at oxford talked with two or three fellows of colleges about putting out a young nephew that was left to his lordship s care to the university and of their being his tutors we diverted ourselves with bantering several other poor scholars with hopes of being at least his lordship s chaplains and putting on a scarf and thus having lived like quality indeed as to expense we went away for northampton and in a word in about twelve days ramble came home again to the tune of about expense vanity is the perfection of a fop my husband had this excellence that he valued nothing of expense and as his history you may be sure has very little weight in it tis enough to tell you that in about two years and a quarter he broke and was not so happy to get over into the mint but got into a spongingouse being arrested in an action too heavy from him to give bail to so he sent for me to come to him it was no surprise to me for i had foreseen some time that all was going to wreck and had been taking care to reserve something if i could though it was not much for myself but when he sent for me he behaved much better than i expected and told me plainly he had played the fool and suffered himself to be surprised which he might have prevented that now he foresaw he could not stand it and therefore he would have me go home and in the night take away everything i had in the house of any value and secure it and after that he told me that if i could get away one hundred or two hundred pounds in goods out of the shop i should do it only says he let me know nothing of it neither what you take nor whither you carry it for as for me says he i am resolved to get out of this house and be gone and if you never hear of me more my dear says he i wish you well i am only sorry for the injury i have done you he said some very handsome things to me indeed at parting for i told you he was a gentleman and that was all the benefit i had of his being so that he used me very handsomely and with good manners upon all occasions even to the last only spent all i had and left me to rob the creditors for something to subsist on however i did as he bade me that you may be sure and having thus taken my leave of him i never saw him more for he found means to break out of the bailiff s house that night or the next and go over into france and for the rest of the creditors scrambled for it as well as they could how i knew not for i could come at no knowledge of anything more than this that he came home about three o clock in the morning caused the rest of his goods to be removed into the mint and the shop to be shut up and having raised what money he could get together he got over as i said to france from whence i had one or two letters from him and no more i did not see him when he came home for he having given me such instructions as above and i having made the best of my time i had no more business back again at the house not knowing but i might have been stopped there by the creditors for a commission of bankrupt being soon after issued they might have stopped me by orders from the commissioners but my husband having so dexterously got out of the bailiff s house by letting himself down in a most desperate manner from almost the top of the house to the top of another building and leaping from thence which was almost two storeys and which was enough indeed to have broken his neck he came home and got away his goods before the creditors could come to seize that is to say before they could get out the commission and be ready to send their officers to take possession my husband was so civil to me for still i say he was much of a gentleman that in the first letter he wrote me from france he let me know where he had pawned twenty pieces of fine holland for which were really worth and enclosed me the token and an order for the taking them up paying the money which i did and made in time above of them having leisure to cut them and sell them some and some to private families as opportunity offered however with all this and all that i had secured before i found upon casting things up my case was very much altered any my fortune much lessened for including the hollands and a parcel of fine muslins which i carried off before and some plate and other things i found i could hardly muster up and my condition was very odd for though i had no child i had had one by my gentleman draper but it was burie yet i was a widow bewitched i had a husband and no husband and i could not pretend to marry again though i knew well enough my husband would never see england any more if he lived fifty years thus i say i was limited from marriage what offer might soever be made me and i had not one friend to advise with in the condition i was in least not one i durst trust the secret of my circumstances to for if the commissioners were to have been informed where i was i should have been fetched up and examined upon oath and all i have saved be taken away from me upon these apprehensions the first thing i did was to go quite out of my knowledge and go by another name this i did effectually for i went into the mint too took lodgings in a very private place dressed up in the habit of a widow and called myself mrs flanders here however i concealed myself and though my new acquaintances knew nothing of me yet i soon got a great deal of company about me and whether it be that women are scarce among the sorts of people that generally are to be found there or that some consolations in the miseries of the place are more requisite than on other occasions i soon found an agreeable woman was exceedingly valuable among the sons of affliction there and that those that wanted money to pay half a crown on the pound to their creditors and that run in debt at the sign of the bull for their dinners would yet find money for a supper if they liked the woman however i kept myself safe yet though i began like my lord rochester s mistress that loved his company but would not admit him farther to have the scandal of a whore without the joy and upon this score tired with the place and indeed with the company too i began to think of removing it was indeed a subject of strange reflection to me to see men who were overwhelmed in perplexed circumstances who were reduced some degrees below being ruined whose families were objects of their own terror and other people s charity yet while a penny lasted nay even beyond it endeavouring to drown themselves labouring to forget former things which now it was the proper time to remember making more work for repentance and sinning on as a remedy for sin past but it is none of my talent to preach these men were too wicked even for me there was something horrid and absurd in their way of sinning for it was all a force even upon themselves they did not only act against conscience but against nature they put a rape upon their temper to drown the reflections which their circumstances continually gave them and nothing was more easy than to see how sighs would interrupt their songs and paleness and anguish sit upon their brows in spite of the forced smiles they put on nay sometimes it would break out at their very mouths when they had parted with their money for a lewd treat or a wicked embrace i have heard them turning about fetch a deep sigh and cry what a dog am i well betty my dear i drink thy health though meaning the honest wife that perhaps had not a halfrown for herself and three or four children the next morning they are at their penitentials again and perhaps the poor weeping wife comes over to him either brings him some account of what his creditors are doing and how she and the children are turned out of doors or some other dreadful news and this adds to his selfeproaches but when he has thought and pored on it till he is almost mad having no principles to support him nothing within him or above him to comfort him but finding it all darkness on every side he flies to the same relief again viz to drink it away debauch it away and falling into company of men in just the same condition with himself he repeats the crime and thus he goes every day one step onward of his way to destruction i was not wicked enough for such fellows as these yet on the contrary i began to consider here very seriously what i had to do how things stood with me and what course i ought to take i knew i had no friends no not one friend or relation in the world and that little i had left apparently wasted which when it was gone i saw nothing but misery and starving was before me upon these considerations i say and filled with horror at the place i was in and the dreadful objects which i had always before me i resolved to be gone i had made an acquaintance with a very sober good sort of a woman who was a widow too like me but in better circumstances her husband had been a captain of a merchant ship and having had the misfortune to be cast away coming home on a voyage from the west indies which would have been very profitable if he had come safe was so reduced by the loss that though he had saved his life then it broke his heart and killed him afterwards and his widow being pursued by the creditors was forced to take shelter in the mint she soon made things up with the help of friends and was at liberty again and finding that i rather was there to be concealed than by any particular prosecutions and finding also that i agreed with her or rather she with me in a just abhorrence of the place and of the company she invited to go home with her till i could put myself in some posture of settling in the world to my mind withal telling me that it was ten to one but some good captain of a ship might take a fancy to me and court me in that part of the town where she lived i accepted her offer and was with her half a year and should have been longer but in that interval what she proposed to me happened to herself and she married very much to her advantage but whose fortune soever was upon the increase mine seemed to be upon the wane and i found nothing present except two or three boatswains or such fellows but as for the commanders they were generally of two sorts such as having good business that is to say a good ship resolved not to marry but with advantage that is with a good fortune such as being out of employ wanted a wife to help them to a ship i mean a wife who having some money could enable them to hold as they call it a good part of a ship themselves so to encourage owners to come in or a wife who if she had not money had friends who were concerned in shipping and so could help to put the young man into a good ship which to them is as good as a portion and neither of these was my case so i looked like one that was to lie on hand this knowledge i soon learned by experience viz that the state of things was altered as to matrimony and that i was not to expect at london what i had found in the country that marriages were here the consequences of politic schemes for forming interests and carrying on business and that love had no share or but very little in the matter that as my sisternaw at colchester had said beauty wit manners sense good humour good behaviour education virtue piety or any other qualification whether of body or mind had no power to recommend that money only made a woman agreeable that men chose mistresses indeed by the gust of their affection and it was requisite to a whore to be handsome wellhaped have a good mien and a graceful behaviour but that for a wife no deformity would shock the fancy no ill qualities the judgment the money was the thing the portion was neither crooked nor monstrous but the money was always agreeable whatever the wife was on the other hand as the market ran very unhappily on the men s side i found the women had lost the privilege of saying no that it was a favour now for a woman to have the question asked and if any young lady had so much arrogance as to counterfeit a negative she never had the opportunity given her of denying twice much less of recovering that false step and accepting what she had but seemed to decline the men had such choice everywhere that the case of the women was very unhappy for they seemed to ply at every door and if the man was by great chance refused at one house he was sure to be received at the next besides this i observed that the men made no scruple to set themselves out and to go aortunehunting as they call it when they had really no fortune themselves to demand it or merit to deserve it and that they carried it so high that a woman was scarce allowed to inquire after the character or estate of the person that pretended to her this i had an example of in a young lady in the next house to me and with whom i had contracted an intimacy she was courted by a young captain and though she had near to her fortune she did but inquire of some of his neighbours about his character his morals or substance and he took occasion at the next visit to let her know truly that he took it very ill and that he should not give her the trouble of his visits any more i heard of it and i had begun my acquaintance with her i went to see her upon it she entered into a close conversation with me about it and unbosomed herself very freely i perceived presently that though she thought herself very ill used yet she had no power to resent it and was exceedingly piqued that she had lost him and particularly that another of less fortune had gained him i fortified her mind against such a meanness as i called it i told her that as low as i was in the world i would have despised a man that should think i ought to take him upon his own recommendation only without having the liberty to inform myself of his fortune and of his character also i told her that as she had a good fortune she had no need to stoop to the disaster of the time that it was enough that the men could insult us that had but little money to recommend us but if she suffered such an affront to pass upon her without resenting it she would be rendered lowrized upon all occasions and would be the contempt of all the women in that part of the town that a woman can never want an opportunity to be revenged of a man that has used her ill and that there were ways enough to humble such a fellow as that or else certainly women were the most unhappy creatures in the world i found she was very well pleased with the discourse and she told me seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her just resentment and either to bring him on again or have the satisfaction of her revenge being as public as possible i told her that if she would take my advice i would tell her how she should obtain her wishes in both these things and that i would engage to bring the man to her door again and make him beg to be let in she smiled at that and plainly let me see that if he came to her door her resentment was not so great as to give her leave to let him stand long there however she listened very willingly to my offer of advice so i told her that the first thing she ought to do was a piece of justice to herself namely that whereas she had been told by several people that he had reported among the ladies that he had left her and pretended to give the advantage of the negative to himself she should take care to have it well spread among the women which she could not fail of an opportunity to do in a neighbourhood so addicted to family news as that she live in was that she had inquired into his circumstances and found he was not the man as to estate he pretended to be let them be told madam said i that you had been well informed that he was not the man that you expected and that you thought it was not safe to meddle with him that you heard he was of an ill temper and that he boasted how he had used the women ill upon many occasions and that particularly he was debauched in his morals etc the last of which indeed had some truth in it but at the same time i did not find that she seemed to like him much the worse for that part as i had put this into her head she came most readily into it immediately she went to work to find instruments and she had very little difficulty in the search for telling her story in general to a couple of gossips in the neighbourhood it was the chat of the teaable all over that part of the town and i met with it wherever i visited also as it was known that i was acquainted with the young lady herself my opinion was asked very often and i confirmed it with all the necessary aggravations and set out his character in the blackest colours but then as a piece of secret intelligence i added as what the other gossips knew nothing of viz that i had heard he was in very bad circumstances that he was under a necessity of a fortune to support his interest with the owners of the ship he commanded that his own part was not paid for and if it was not paid quickly his owners would put him out of the ship and his chief mate was likely to command it who offered to buy that part which the captain had promised to take i added for i confess i was heartily piqued at the rogue as i called him that i had heard a rumour too that he had a wife alive at plymouth and another in the west indies a thing which they all knew was not very uncommon for such kind of gentlemen this worked as we both desire it for presently the young lady next door who had a father and mother that governed both her and her fortune was shut up and her father forbid him the house also in one place more where he went the woman had the courage however strange it was to say no and he could try nowhere but he was reproached with his pride and that he pretended not to give the women leave to inquire into his character and the like well by this time he began to be sensible of his mistake and having alarmed all the women on that side of the water he went over to ratcliff and got access to some of the ladies there but though the young women there too were according to the fate of the day pretty willing to be asked yet such was his illuck that his character followed him over the water and his good name was much the same there as it was on our side so that though he might have had wives enough yet it did not happen among the women that had good fortunes which was what he wanted but this was not all she very ingeniously managed another thing herself for she got a young gentleman who as a relation and was indeed a married man to come and visit her two or three times a week in a very fine chariot and good liveries and her two agents and i also presently spread a report all over that this gentleman came to court her that he was a gentleman of a a year and that he was fallen in love with her and that she was going to her aunt s in the city because it was inconvenient for the gentleman to come to her with his coach in redriff the streets being so narrow and difficult this took immediately the captain was laughed at in all companies and was ready to hang himself he tried all the ways possible to come at her again and wrote the most passionate letters to her in the world excusing his former rashness and in short by great application obtained leave to wait on her again as he said to clear his reputation at this meeting she had her full revenge of him for she told him she wondered what he took her to be that she should admit any man to a treaty of so much consequence as that to marriage without inquiring very well into his circumstances that if he thought she was to be huffed into wedlock and that she was in the same circumstances which her neighbours might be in viz to take up with the first good christian that came he was mistaken that in a word his character was really bad or he was very ill beholden to his neighbours and that unless he could clear up some points in which she had justly been prejudiced she had no more to say to him but to do herself justice and give him the satisfaction of knowing that she was not afraid to say no either to him or any man else with that she told him what she had heard or rather raised herself by my means of his character his not having paid for the part he pretended to own of the ship he commanded of the resolution of his owners to put him out of the command and to put his mate in his stead and of the scandal raised on his morals his having been reproached with suchnduch women and having a wife at plymouth and in the west indies and the like and she asked him whether he could deny that she had good reason if these things were not cleared up to refuse him and in the meantime to insist upon having satisfaction in points to significant as they were he was so confounded at her discourse that he could not answer a word and she almost began to believe that all was true by his disorder though at the same time she knew that she had been the raiser of all those reports herself after some time he recovered himself a little and from that time became the most humble the most modest and most importunate man alive in his courtship she carried her jest on a great way she asked him if he thought she was so at her last shift that she could or ought to bear such treatment and if he did not see that she did not want those who thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did meaning the gentleman whom she had brought to visit her by way of sham she brought him by these tricks to submit to all possible measures to satisfy her as well of his circumstances as of his behaviour he brought her undeniable evidence of his having paid for his part of the ship he brought her certificates from his owners that the report of their intending to remove him from the command of the ship and put his chief mate in was false and groundless in short he was quite the reverse of what he was before thus i convinced her that if the men made their advantage of our sex in the affair of marriage upon the supposition of there being such choice to be had and of the women being so easy it was only owing to this that the women wanted courage to maintain their ground and to play their part and that according to my lord rochester a woman s ne er so ruined but she can revenge herself on her undoer man after these things this young lady played her part so well that though she resolved to have him and that indeed having him was the main bent of her design yet she made his obtaining her be to him the most difficult thing in the world and this she did not by a haughty reserved carriage but by a just policy turning the tables upon him and playing back upon him his own game for as he pretended by a kind of lofty carriage to place himself above the occasion of a character and to make inquiring into his character a kind of an affront to him she broke with him upon that subject and at the same time that she make him submit to all possible inquiry after his affairs she apparently shut the door against his looking into her own it was enough to him to obtain her for a wife as to what she had she told him plainly that as he knew her circumstances it was but just she should know his and though at the same time he had only known her circumstances by common fame yet he had made so many protestations of his passion for her that he could ask no more but her hand to his grand request and the like ramble according to the custom of lovers in short he left himself no room to ask any more questions about her estate and she took the advantage of it like a prudent woman for she placed part of her fortune so in trustees without letting him know anything of it that it was quite out of his reach and made him be very well content with the rest it is true she was pretty well besides that is to say she had about in money which she gave him and the other after some time she brought to light as a perquisite to herself which he was to accept as a mighty favour seeing though it was not to be his it might ease him in the article of her particular expenses and i must add that by this conduct the gentleman himself became not only the more humble in his applications to her to obtain her but also was much the more an obliging husband to her when he had her i cannot but remind the ladies here how much they place themselves below the common station of a wife which if i may be allowed not to be partial is low enough already i say they place themselves below their common station and prepare their own mortifications by their submitting so to be insulted by the men beforehand which i confess i see no necessity of this relation may serve therefore to let the ladies see that the advantage is not so much on the other side as the men think it is and though it may be true that the men have but too much choice among us and that some women may be found who will dishonour themselves be cheap and easy to come at and will scarce wait to be asked yet if they will have women as i may say worth having they may find them as uncometable as ever and that those that are otherwise are a sort of people that have such deficiencies when had as rather recommend the ladies that are difficult than encourage the men to go on with their easy courtship and expect wives equally valuable that will come at first call nothing is more certain than that the ladies always gain of the men by keeping their ground and letting their pretended lovers see they can resent being slighted and that they are not afraid of saying no they i observe insult us mightily with telling us of the number of women that the wars and the sea and trade and other incidents have carried the men so much away that there is no proportion between the numbers of the sexes and therefore the women have the disadvantage but i am far from granting that the number of women is so great or the number of men so small but if they will have me tell the truth the disadvantage of the women is a terrible scandal upon the men and it lies here and here only namely that the age is so wicked and the sex so debauched that in short the number of such men as an honest woman ought to meddle with is small indeed and it is but here and there that a man is to be found who is fit for a woman to venture upon but the consequence even of that too amounts to no more than this that women ought to be the more nice for how do we know the just character of the man that makes the offer to say that the woman should be the more easy on this occasion is to say we should be the forwarder to venture because of the greatness of the danger which in my way of reasoning is very absurd on the contrary the women have ten thousand times the more reason to be wary and backward by how much the hazard of being betrayed is the greater and would the ladies consider this and act the wary part they would discover every cheat that offered for in short the lives of very few men nowadays will bear a character and if the ladies do but make a little inquiry they will soon be able to distinguish the men and deliver themselves as for women that do not think their own safety worth their thought that impatient of their perfect state resolve as they call it to take the first good christian that comes that run into matrimony as a horse rushes into the battle i can say nothing to them but this that they are a sort of ladies that are to be prayed for among the rest of distempered people and to me they look like people that venture their whole estates in a lottery where there is a hundred thousand blanks to one prize no man of commonense will value a woman the less for not giving up herself at the first attack or for accepting his proposal without inquiring into his person or character on the contrary he must think her the weakest of all creatures in the world as the rate of men now goes in short he must have a very contemptible opinion of her capacities nay every of her understanding that having but one case of her life shall call that life away at once and make matrimony like death be a leap in the dark i would fain have the conduct of my sex a little regulated in this particular which is the thing in which of all the parts of life i think at this time we suffer most in tis nothing but lack of courage the fear of not being married at all and of that frightful state of life called an old maid of which i have a story to tell by itself this i say is the woman s snare but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity that by exposing themselves as they do and if they did not marry so soon as they may do otherwise they would make themselves amends by marrying safer she is always married too soon who gets a bad husband and she is never married too late who gets a good one in a word there is no woman deformity or lost reputation excepted but if she manages well may be married safely one time or other but if she precipitates herself it is ten thousand to one but she is undone but i come now to my own case in which there was at this time no little nicety the circumstances i was in made the offer of a good husband the most necessary thing in the world to me but i found soon that to be made cheap and easy was not the way it soon began to be found that the widow had no fortune and to say this was to say all that was ill of me for i began to be dropped in all the discourses of matrimony being wellred handsome witty modest and agreeable all which i had allowed to my character whether justly or no is not the purpose i say all these would not do without the dross which way now become more valuable than virtue itself in short the widow they said had no money i resolved therefore as to the state of my present circumstances that it was absolutely necessary to change my station and make a new appearance in some other place where i was not known and even to pass by another name if i found occasion i communicated my thoughts to my intimate friend the captain s lady whom i had so faithfully served in her case with the captain and who was as ready to serve me in the same kind as i could desire i made no scruple to lay my circumstances open to her my stock was but low for i had made but about at the close of my last affair and i had wasted some of that however i had about left a great many very rich clothes a gold watch and some jewels though of no extraordinary value and about or left in linen not disposed of my dear and faithful friend the captain s wife was so sensible of the service i had done her in the affair above that she was not only a steady friend to me but knowing my circumstances she frequently made me presents as money came into her hands such as fully amounted to a maintenance so that i spent none of my own and at last she made this unhappy proposal to me viz that as we had observed as above how the men made no scruple to set themselves out as persons meriting a woman of fortune when they had really no fortune of their own it was but just to deal with them in their own way and if it was possible to deceive the deceiver the captain s lady in short put this project into my head and told me if i would be ruled by her i should certainly get a husband of fortune without leaving him any room to reproach me with want of my own i told her as i had reason to do that i would give up myself wholly to her directions and that i would have neither tongue to speak nor feet to step in that affair but as she should direct me depending that she would extricate me out of every difficulty she brought me into which she said she would answer for the first step she put me upon was to call her cousin and go to a relation s house of hers in the country where she directed me and where she brought her husband to visit me and calling me cousin she worked matters so about that her husband and she together invited me most passionately to come to town and be with them for they now live in a quite different place from where they were before in the next place she tells her husband that i had at least fortune and that after some of my relations i was like to have a great deal more it was enough to tell her husband this there needed nothing on my side i was but to sit still and wait the event for it presently went all over the neighbourhood that the young widow at captain s was a fortune that she had at least and perhaps a great deal more and that the captain said so and if the captain was asked at any time about me he made no scruple to affirm it though he knew not one word of the matter other than that his wife had told him so and in this he thought no harm for he really believed it to be so because he had it from his wife so slender a foundation will those fellows build upon if they do but think there is a fortune in the game with the reputation of this fortune i presently found myself blessed with admirers enough and that i had my choice of men as scarce as they said they were which by the way confirms what i was saying before this being my case i who had a subtle game to play had nothing now to do but to single out from them all the properest man that might be for my purpose that is to say the man who was most likely to depend upon the hearsay of a fortune and not inquire too far into the particulars and unless i did this i did nothing for my case would not bear much inquiry i picked out my man without much difficulty by the judgment i made of his way of courting me i had let him run on with his protestations and oaths that he loved me above all the world that if i would make him happy that was enough all which i knew was upon supposition nay it was upon a full satisfaction that i was very rich though i never told him a word of it myself this was my man but i was to try him to the bottom and indeed in that consisted my safety for if he baulked i knew i was undone as surely as he was undone if he took me and if i did not make some scruple about his fortune it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine and first therefore i pretended on all occasions to doubt his sincerity and told him perhaps he only courted me for my fortune he stopped my mouth in that part with the thunder of his protestations as above but still i pretended to doubt one morning he pulls off his diamond ring and writes upon the glass of the sash in my chamber this line you i love and you alone i read it and asked him to lend me his ring with which i wrote under it thus and so in love says every one he takes his ring again and writes another line thus virtue alone is an estate i borrowed it again and i wrote under it but money s virtue gold is fate he coloured as red as fire to see me turn so quick upon him and in a kind of a rage told me he would conquer me and writes again thus i scorn your gold and yet i love i ventured all upon the last cast of poetry as you see for i wrote boldly under his last i poor let s see how kind you prove this was a sad truth to me whether he believed me or no i could not tell i supposed then that he did not however he flew to me took me in his arms and kissing me very eagerly and with the greatest passion imaginable he held me fast till he called for a pen and ink and then told me he could not wait the tedious writing on the glass but pulling out a piece of paper he began and wrote again be mine with all your poverty i took his pen and followed him immediately thus yet secretly you hope i lie he told me that was unkind because it was not just and that i put him upon contradicting me which did not consist with good manners any more than with his affection and therefore since i had insensibly drawn him into this poetical scribble he begged i would not oblige him to break it off so he writes again let love alone be our debate i wrote again she loves enough that does not hate this he took for a favour and so laid down the cudgels that is to say the pen i say he took if for a favour and a mighty one it was if he had known all however he took it as i meant it that is to let him think i was inclined to go on with him as indeed i had all the reason in the world to do for he was the bestumoured merry sort of a fellow that i ever met with and i often reflected on myself how doubly criminal it was to deceive such a man but that necessity which pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition was my authority for it and certainly his affection to me and the goodness of his temper however they might argue against using him ill yet they strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than some fieryempered wretch who might have nothing to recommend him but those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable all her days besides though i jested with him as he supposed i so often about my poverty yet when he found it to be true he had foreclosed all manner of objection seeing whether he was in jest or in earnest he had declared he took me without any regard to my portion and whether i was in jest or in earnest i had declared myself to be very poor so that in a word i had him fast both ways and though he might say afterwards he was cheated yet he could never say that i had cheated him he pursued me close after this and as i saw there was no need to fear losing him i played the indifferent part with him longer than prudence might otherwise have dictated to me but i considered how much this caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him when i should come to be under the necessity of owning my own circumstances to him and i managed it the more warily because i found he inferred from thence as indeed he ought to do that i either had the more money or the more judgment and would not venture at all i took the freedom one day after we had talked pretty close to the subject to tell him that it was true i had received the compliment of a lover from him namely that he would take me without inquiring into my fortune and i would make him a suitable return in this viz that i would make as little inquiry into his as consisted with reason but i hoped he would allow me to ask a few questions which he would answer or not as he thought fit and that i would not be offended if he did not answer me at all one of these questions related to our manner of living and the place where because i had heard he had a great plantation in virginia and that he had talked of going to live there and i told him i did not care to be transported he began from this discourse to let me voluntarily into all his affairs and to tell me in a frank open way all his circumstances by which i found he was very well to pass in the world but that great part of his estate consisted of three plantations which he had in virginia which brought him in a very good income generally speaking to the tune of a year but that if he was to live upon them would bring him in four times as much very well thought i you shall carry me thither as soon as you please though i won t tell you so beforehand i jested with him extremely about the figure he would make in virginia but i found he would do anything i desired though he did not seem glad to have me undervalue his plantations so i turned my tale i told him i had good reason not to go there to live because if his plantations were worth so much there i had not a fortune suitable to a gentleman of a year as he said his estate would be he replied generously he did not ask what my fortune was he had told me from the beginning he would not and he would be as good as his word but whatever it was he assured me he would never desire me to go to virginia with him or go thither himself without me unless i was perfectly willing and made it my choice all this you may be sure was as i wished and indeed nothing could have happened more perfectly agreeable i carried it on as far as this with a sort of indifferency that he often wondered at more than at first but which was the only support of his courtship and i mention it the rather to intimate again to the ladies that nothing but want of courage for such an indifferency makes our sex so cheap and prepares them to be illsed as they are would they venture the loss of a pretending fop now and then who carries it high upon the point of his own merit they would certainly be less slighted and courted more had i discovered really and truly what my great fortune was and that in all i had not full when he expected yet i had hooked him so fast and played him so long that i was satisfied he would have had me in my worst circumstances and indeed it was less a surprise to him when he learned the truth than it would have been because having not the least blame to lay on me who had carried it with an air of indifference to the last he would not say one word except that indeed he thought it had been more but that if it had been less he did not repent his bargain only that he should not be able to maintain me so well as he intended in short we were married and very happily married on my side i assure you as to the man for he was the bestumoured man that every woman had but his circumstances were not so good as i imagined as on the other hand he had not bettered himself by marrying so much as he expected when we were married i was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little stock i had and to let him see it was no more but there was a necessity for it so i took my opportunity one day when we were alone to enter into a short dialogue with him about it my dear said i we have been married a fortnight is it not time to let you know whether you have got a wife with something or with nothing your own time for that my dear says he i am satisfied that i have got the wife i love i have not troubled you much says he with my inquiry after it that s true says i but i have a great difficulty upon me about it which i scarce know how to manage what s that dear says he why says i tis a little hard upon me and tis harder upon you i am told that captain meaning my friend s husban has told you i had a great deal more money than i ever pretended to have and i am sure i never employed him to do so well says he captain may have told me so but what then if you have not so much that may lie at his door but you never told me what you had so i have no reason to blame you if you have nothing at all that s is so just said i and so generous that it makes my having but a little a double affliction to me the less you have my dear says he the worse for us both but i hope your affliction you speak of is not caused for fear i should be unkind to you for want of a portion no no if you have nothing tell me plainly and at once i may perhaps tell the captain he has cheated me but i can never say you have cheated me for did you not give it under your hand that you were poor and so i ought to expect you to be well said i my dear i am glad i have not been concerned in deceiving you before marriage if i deceive you since tis ne er the worse that i am poor is too true but not so poor as to have nothing neither so i pulled out some bank bills and gave him about there s something my dear said i and not quite all neither i had brought him so near to expecting nothing by what i had said before that the money though the sum was small in itself was doubly welcome to him he owned it was more than he looked for and that he did not question by my discourse to him but that my fine clothes gold watch and a diamond ring or two had been all my fortune i let him please himself with that two or three days and then having been abroad that day and as if i had been to fetch it i brought him more home in gold and told him there was a little more portion for him and in short in about a week more i brought him more and about in linen which i made him believe i had been obliged to take with the which i gave him in gold as a composition for a debt of being little more than five shillings in the pound and overvalued too and now my dear says i to him i am very sorry to tell you that there is all and that i have given you my whole fortune i added that if the person who had my had not abused me i had been worth to him but that as it was i had been faithful to him and reserved nothing to myself but if it had been more he should have had it he was so obliged by the manner and so pleased with the sum for he had been in a terrible fright lest it had been nothing at all that he accepted it very thankfully and thus i got over the fraud of passing for a fortune without money and cheating a man into marrying me on pretence of a fortune which by the way i take to be one of the most dangerous steps a woman can take and in which she runs the most hazard of being illsed afterwards my husband to give him his due was a man of infinite good nature but he was no fool and finding his income not suited to the manner of living which he had intended if i had brought him what he expected and being under a disappointment in his return of his plantations in virginia he discovered many times his inclination of going over to virginia to live upon his own and often would be magnifying the way of living there how cheap how plentiful how pleasant and the like i began presently to understand this meaning and i took him up very plainly one morning and told him that i did so that i found his estate turned to no account at this distance compared to what it would do if he lived upon the spot and that i found he had a mind to go and live there and i added that i was sensible he had been disappointed in a wife and that finding his expectations not answered that way i could do no less to make him amends than tell him that i was very willing to go over to virginia with him and live there he said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such a proposal to him he told me that however he was disappointed in his expectations of a fortune he was not disappointed in a wife and that i was all to him that a wife could be and he was more than satisfied on the whole when the particulars were put together but that this offer was so kind that it was more than he could express to bring the story short we agreed to go he told me that he had a very good house there that it was well furnished that his mother was alive and lived in it and one sister which was all the relations he had that as soon as he came there his mother would remove to another house which was her own for life and his after her decease so that i should have all the house to myself and i found all this to be exactly as he had said to make this part of the story short we put on board the ship which we went in a large quantity of good furniture for our house with stores of linen and other necessaries and a good cargo for sale and away we went to give an account of the manner of our voyage which was long and full of dangers is out of my way i kept no journal neither did my husband all that i can say is that after a terrible passage frighted twice with dreadful storms and once with what was still more terrible i mean a pirate who came on board and took away almost all our provisions and which would have been beyond all to me they had once taken my husband to go along with them but by entreaties were prevailed with to leave him i say after all these terrible things we arrived in york river in virginia and coming to our plantation we were received with all the demonstrations of tenderness and affection by my husband s mother that were possible to be expressed we lived here all together my mothernaw at my entreaty continuing in the house for she was too kind a mother to be parted with my husband likewise continued the same as at first and i thought myself the happiest creature alive when an odd and surprising event put an end to all that felicity in a moment and rendered my condition the most uncomfortable if not the most miserable in the world my mother was a mighty cheerful goodumoured old woman i may call her old woman for her son was above thirty i say she was very pleasant good company and used to entertain me in particular with abundance of stories to divert me as well of the country we were in as of the people among the rest she often told me how the greatest part of the inhabitants of the colony came thither in very indifferent circumstances from england that generally speaking they were of two sorts either first such as were brought over by masters of ships to be sold as servants such as we call them my dear says she but they are more properly called slaves or secondly such as are transported from newgate and other prisons after having been found guilty of felony and other crimes punishable with death when they come here says she we make no difference the planters buy them and they work together in the field till their time is out when tis expired said she they have encouragement given them to plant for themselves for they have a certain number of acres of land allotted them by the country and they go to work to clear and cure the land and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for their own use and as the tradesmen and merchants will trust them with tools and clothes and other necessaries upon the credit of their crop before it is grown so they again plant every year a little more than the year before and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is before them hence child says she man a newgateird becomes a great man and we have continued she several justices of the peace officers of the trained bands and magistrates of the towns they live in that have been burnt in the hand she was going on with that part of the story when her own part in it interrupted her and with a great deal of goodumoured confidence she told me she was one of the second sort of inhabitants herself that she came away openly having ventured too far in a particular case so that she was become a criminal and here s the mark of it child says she and pulling off her glove look ye here says she turning up the palm of her hand and showed me a very fine white arm and hand but branded in the inside of the hand as in such cases it must be this story was very moving to me but my mother smiling said you need not think a thing strange daughter for as i told you some of the best men in this country are burnt in the hand and they are not ashamed to own it there s major says she he was an eminent pickpocket there s justice ba r was a shoplifter and both of them were burnt in the hand and i could name you several such as they are we had frequent discourses of this kind and abundance of instances she gave me of the like after some time as she was telling some stories of one that was transported but a few weeks ago i began in an intimate kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own story which she did with the utmost plainness and sincerity how she had fallen into very ill company in london in her young days occasioned by her mother sending her frequently to carry victuals and other relief to a kinswoman of hers who was a prisoner in newgate and who lay in a miserable starving condition was afterwards condemned to be hanged but having got respite by pleading her belly dies afterwards in the prison here my mothernaw ran out in a long account of the wicked practices in that dreadful place and how it ruined more young people than all the town besides and child says my mother perhaps you may know little of it or it may be have heard nothing about it but depend upon it says she we all know here that there are more thieves and rogues made by that one prison of newgate than by all the clubs and societies of villains in the nation tis that cursed place says my mother that half peopled this colony here she went on with her own story so long and in so particular a manner that i began to be very uneasy but coming to one particular that required telling her name i thought i should have sunk down in the place she perceived i was out of order and asked me if i was not well and what ailed me i told her i was so affected with the melancholy story she had told and the terrible things she had gone through that it had overcome me and i begged of her to talk no more of it why my dear says she very kindly what need these things trouble you these passages were long before your time and they give me no trouble at all now nay i look back on them with a particular satisfaction as they have been a means to bring me to this place then she went on to tell me how she very luckily fell into a good family where behaving herself well and her mistress dying her master married her by whom she had my husband and his sister and that by her diligence and good management after her husband s death she had improved the plantations to such a degree as they then were so that most of the estate was of her getting not her husband s for she had been a widow upwards of sixteen years i heard this part of the story with very little attention because i wanted much to retire and give vent to my passions which i did soon after and let any one judge what must be the anguish of my mind when i came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less than my own mother and i had now had two children and was big with another by my own brother and lay with him still every night i was now the most unhappy of all women in the world oh had the story never been told me all had been well it had been no crime to have lain with my husband since as to his being my relation i had known nothing of it i had now such a load on my mind that it kept me perpetually waking to reveal it which would have been some ease to me i could not find would be to any purpose and yet to conceal it would be next to impossible nay i did not doubt but i should talk of it in my sleep and tell my husband of it whether i would or no if i discovered it the least thing i could expect was to lose my husband for he was too nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had known i had been his sister so that i was perplexed to the last degree i leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view i was away from my native country at a distance prodigious and the return to me unpassable i lived very well but in a circumstance insufferable in itself if i had discovered myself to my mother it might be difficult to convince her of the particulars and i had no way to prove them on the other hand if she had questioned or doubted me i had been undone for the bare suggestion would have immediately separated me from my husband without gaining my mother or him who would have been neither a husband nor a brother so that between the surprise on one hand and the uncertainty on the other i had been sure to be undone in the meantime as i was but too sure of the fact i lived therefore in open avowed incest and whoredom and all under the appearance of an honest wife and though i was not much touched with the crime of it yet the action had something in it shocking to nature and made my husband as he thought himself even nauseous to me however upon the most sedate consideration i resolved that it was absolutely necessary to conceal it all and not make the least discovery of it either to mother or husband and thus i lived with the greatest pressure imaginable for three years more but had no more children during this time my mother used to be frequently telling me old stories of her former adventures which however were no ways pleasant to me for by it though she did not tell it me in plain terms yet i could easily understand joined with what i had heard myself of my first tutors that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief but i verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both and that she was then a very pious sober and religious woman well let her life have been what it would then it was certain that my life was very uneasy to me for i lived as i have said but in the worst sort of whoredom and as i could expect no good of it so really no good issue came of it and all my seeming prosperity wore off and ended in misery and destruction it was some time indeed before it came to this for but i know not by what ill fate guided everything went wrong with us afterwards and that which was worse my husband grew strangely altered forward jealous and unkind and i was as impatient of bearing his carriage as the carriage was unreasonable and unjust these things proceeded so far that we came at last to be in such ill terms with one another that i claimed a promise of him which he entered willingly into with me when i consented to come from england with him viz that if i found the country not to agree with me or that i did not like to live there i should come away to england again when i pleased giving him a year s warning to settle his affairs i say i now claimed this promise of him and i must confess i did it not in the most obliging terms that could be in the world neither but i insisted that he treated me ill that i was remote from my friends and could do myself no justice and that he was jealous without cause my conversation having been unblamable and he having no pretense for it and that to remove to england would take away all occasion from him i insisted so peremptorily upon it that he could not avoid coming to a point either to keep his word with me or to break it and this notwithstanding he used all the skill he was master of and employed his mother and other agents to prevail with me to alter my resolutions indeed the bottom of the thing lay at my heart and that made all his endeavours fruitless for my heart was alienated from him as a husband i loathed the thoughts of bedding with him and used a thousand pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me fearing nothing more than to be with child by him which to be sure would have prevented or at least delayed my going over to england however at last i put him so out of humour that he took up a rash and fatal resolution in short i should not go to england and though he had promised me yet it was an unreasonable thing for me to desire it that it would be ruinous to his affairs would unhinge his whole family and be next to an undoing him in the world that therefore i ought not to desire it of him and that no wife in the world that valued her family and her husband s prosperity would insist upon such a thing this plunged me again for when i considered the thing calmly and took my husband as he really was a diligent careful man in the main work of laying up an estate for his children and that he knew nothing of the dreadful circumstances that he was in i could not but confess to myself that my proposal was very unreasonable and what no wife that had the good of her family at heart would have desired but my discontents were of another nature i looked upon him no longer as a husband but as a near relation the son of my own mother and i resolved somehow or other to be clear of him but which way i did not know nor did it seem possible it is said by the illatured world of our sex that if we are set on a thing it is impossible to turn us from our resolutions in short i never ceased poring upon the means to bring to pass my voyage and came that length with my husband at last as to propose going without him this provoked him to the last degree and he called me not only an unkind wife but an unnatural mother and asked me how i could entertain such a thought without horror as that of leaving my two children for one was dea without a mother and to be brought up by strangers and never to see them more it was true had things been right i should not have done it but now it was my real desire never to see them or him either any more and as to the charge of unnatural i could easily answer it to myself while i knew that the whole relation was unnatural in the highest degree in the world however it was plain there was no bringing my husband to anything he would neither go with me nor let me go without him and it was quite out of my power to stir without his consent as any one that knows the constitution of the country i was in knows very well we had many family quarrels about it and they began in time to grow up to a dangerous height for as i was quite estranged from my husband as he was calle in affection so i took no heed to my words but sometimes gave him language that was provoking and in short strove all i could to bring him to a parting with me which was what above all things in the world i desired most he took my carriage very ill and indeed he might well do so for at last i refused to bed with him and carrying on the breach upon all occasions to extremity he told me once he thought i was mad and if i did not alter my conduct he would put me under cure that is to say into a madhouse i told him he should find i was far enough from mad and that it was not in his power or any other villain s to murder me i confess at the same time i was heartily frighted at his thoughts of putting me into a madhouse which would at once have destroyed all the possibility of breaking the truth out whatever the occasion might be for that then no one would have given credit to a word of it this therefore brought me to a resolution whatever came of it to lay open my whole case but which way to do it or to whom was an inextricable difficulty and took me many months to resolve in the meantime another quarrel with my husband happened which came up to such a mad extreme as almost pushed me on to tell it him all to his face but though i kept it in so as not to come to the particulars i spoke so much as put him into the utmost confusion and in the end brought out the whole story he began with a calm expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to england i defended it and one hard word bringing on another as is usual in all family strife he told me i did not treat him as if he was my husband or talk of my children as if i was a mother and in short that i did not deserve to be used as a wife that he had used all the fair means possible with me that he had argued with all the kindness and calmness that a husband or a christian ought to do and that i made him such a vile return that i treated him rather like a dog than a man and rather like the most contemptible stranger than a husband that he was very loth to use violence with me but that in short he saw a necessity of it now and that for the future he should be obliged to take such measures as should reduce me to my duty my blood was now fired to the utmost though i knew what he had said was very true and nothing could appear more provoked i told him for his fair means and his foul they were equally contemned by me that for my going to england i was resolved on it come what would and that as to treating him not like a husband and not showing myself a mother to my children there might be something more in it than he understood at present but for his further consideration i thought fit to tell him thus much that he neither was my lawful husband nor they lawful children and that i had reason to regard neither of them more than i did i confess i was moved to pity him when i spoke it for he turned pale as death and stood mute as one thunderstruck and once or twice i thought he would have fainted in short it put him in a fit something like an apoplex he trembled a sweat or dew ran off his face and yet he was cold as a clod so that i was forced to run and fetch something for him to keep life in him when he recovered of that he grew sick and vomited and in a little after was put to bed and the next morning was as he had been indeed all night in a violent fever however it went off again and he recovered though but slowly and when he came to be a little better he told me i had given him a mortal wound with my tongue and he had only one thing to ask before he desired an explanation i interrupted him and told him i was sorry i had gone so far since i saw what disorder it put him into but i desired him not to talk to me of explanations for that would but make things worse this heightened his impatience and indeed perplexed him beyond all bearing for now he began to suspect that there was some mystery yet unfolded but could not make the
