to bother my life out we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my shoulder and said with some displeasure you are growing tall pip i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control she said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and i had landed her at her dressingable she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours joe gargery ma am meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to yes miss havisham you had better be apprenticed at once would gargery come here with you and bring your indentures do you think i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be asked then let him come at any particular time miss havisham there there i know nothing about times let him come soon and come along with you when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous period she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was doorats under our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously thought she was fit for when she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing got out the dustpan which was always a very bad sign put on her coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent not satisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbingrush and cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the backard it was ten o clock at night before we ventured to creep in again and then she asked joe why he hadn t married a negress slave at once joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation chapter it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss havisham s however as he thought his courtuit necessary to the occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his workingress the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled up his shirtollar so very high behind that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers at breakfastime my sister declared her intention of going to town with us and being left at uncle pumblechook s and called for when we had done with our fine ladies a way of putting the case from which joe appeared inclined to augur the worst the forge was shut up for the day and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at wor the monosyllable hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was a fine bright day i am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were displayed as articles of property much as cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession when we came to pumblechook s my sister bounced in and left us as it was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havisham s house estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew so well i followed next to her and joe came last when i looked back at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coatuff and conducted him into miss havisham s presence she was seated at her dressingable and looked round at us immediately oh said she to joe you are the husband of the sister of this boy i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this boy it was very aggravating but throughout the interview joe persisted in addressing me instead of miss havisham which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time what you might call if you was anyways incline a single man well said miss havisham and you have reared the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr gargery you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it were looked for ard to betwixt us as being calc lated to lead to larks not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the business such as its being open to black and sut or suchike not but what they would have been attended to don t you see has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection does he like the trade which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that it were the wish of your own hart i saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on to sa and there weren t no objection on your part and pip it were the great wish of your hart it was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he ought to speak to miss havisham the more i made faces and gestures to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he persisted in being to me have you brought his indentures with you asked miss havisham well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you know as they are here with which he took them out and gave them not to miss havisham but to me i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good fellow i know i was ashamed of him when i saw that estella stood at the back of miss havisham s chair and that her eyes laughed mischievously i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to miss havisham you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium with the boy joe i remonstrated for he made no reply at all why don t you answer pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me and which you know the answer to be full well no you know it to be no pip and wherefore should i say it miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took up a little bag from the table beside her pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is there are fivendwenty guineas in this bag give it to your master pip as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass persisted in addressing me this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near nor nowheres and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar expression were applied to miss havisham and now old chap may we do our duty may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another and by them which your liberal present haveonweyed to be for the satisfaction of mindf them as never here joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words and from myself far be it these words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice goodye pip said miss havisham let them out estella am i to come again miss havisham i asked no gargery is your master now gargery one word thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and that is his reward of course as an honest man you will expect no other and no more how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine but i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went after him and laid hold of him in another minute we were outside the gate and it was locked and estella was gone when we stood in the daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me astonishing and there he remained so long saying astonishing at intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming back at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this is asonshing and so by degrees became conversational and able to walk away i have reason to think that joe s intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechook s he invented a subtle and deep design my reason is to be found in what took place in mr pumblechook s parlour where on our presenting ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman well cried my sister addressing us both at once and what s happened to you i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this i am sure i do miss havisham said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of remembrance made it wery partick ler that we should give her were it compliments or respects pip compliments i said which that were my own belief answered joe her compliments to mrs j gargery much good they do me observed my sister but rather gratified too and wishing pursued joe with another fixed look at me like another effort of remembrance that the state of miss havisham s elth were sitch as would have allowed were it pip of her having the pleasure i added of ladies company said joe and drew a long breath well cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr pumblechook she might have had the politeness to send that message at first but it s better late than never and what did she give young rantipole here she giv him said joe nothing mrs joe was going to break out but joe went on what she giv said joe she giv to his friends and by his friends were her explanation i mean into the hands of his sister mrs j gargery them were her words mrs j gargery she mayn t have know added joe with an appearance of reflection whether it were joe or jorge my sister looked at pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden armhair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all about it beforehand and how much have you got asked my sister laughing positively laughing what would present company say to ten pound demanded joe they say returned my sister curtly pretty well not too much but pretty well it s more than that then said joe that fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he rubbed the arms of his chair it s more than that mum why you don t mean to say began my sister yes i do mum said pumblechook but wait a bit go on joseph good in you go on what would present company say proceeded joe to twenty pound handsome would be the word returned my sister well then said joe it s more than twenty pound that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a patronizing laugh it s more than that mum good again follow her up joseph then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my sister it s fivendwenty pound it s fivendwenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers pumblechook rising to shake hands with her and it s no more than your merits as i said when my opinion was aske and i wish you joy of the money if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind now you see joseph and wife said pumblechook as he took me by the arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with what they ve begun this boy must be bound out of hand that s my way bound out of hand goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the mone we re deeply beholden to you never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler a pleasure s a pleasure all the world over but this boy you know we must have him bound i said i see to it to tell you the truth the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial presence i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed it was the general impression in court that i had been taken redanded for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some people say what s he done and others he s a young un too but looks bad don t he one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausagehop of fetters and entitled to be read in my cell the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a church and with people hanging over the pews looking on and with mighty justices one with a powdered hea leaning back in chairs with folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading the newspapers and with some shining black portraits on the walls which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and stickinglaster here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested and i was bound mr pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little preliminaries disposed of when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me we went back to pumblechook s and there my sister became so excited by the twentyive guineas that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and that pumblechook must go over in his chaiseart and bring the hubbles and mr wopsle it was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed for it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment and to make it worse they all asked me from time to time in short whenever they had nothing else to do why i didn t enjoy myself and what could i possibly do then but say i was enjoying myself when i wasn t however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the most of it that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldn t let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up and told me to enjoy myself that rather late in the evening mr wopsle gave us collins s ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it wasn t the tumblers arms that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o lady fair mr wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about everybody s private affair that he was the man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like joe s trade i had liked it once but once was not now chapter it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home there may be black ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sister s temper but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it i had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon i had believed in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence within a single year all this was changed now it was all coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella see it on any account how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault how much miss havisham s how much my sister s is now of no moment to me or to any one the change was made in me the thing was done well or ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my shirtleeves and go into the forge joe s prentice i should be distinguished and happy now the reality was in my hold i only felt that i was dusty with the dust of smalloal and that i had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather there have been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most live when i have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to joe i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea i was quite as dejected on the first workingay of my apprenticeship as in that afterime but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe while my indentures lasted it is about the only thing i am glad to know of myself in that connection for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i proceed to add was joe s it was not because i was faithful but because joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of industry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain it is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honestearted dutyoing man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has touched one s self in going by and i know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented joe and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me what i wanted who can say how can i say when i never knew what i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge i was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss havisham s would seem to show me estella s face in the fire with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me often at such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last after that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than ever in my own ungracious breast chapter as i was getting too big for mr wopsle s greatunt s room my education under that preposterous female terminated not however until biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a halfenny although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines when i went to lunnon town sirs too rul loo rul too rul loo rul wasn t i done very brown sirs too rul loo rul too rul loo rul still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i thought as i still the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry in my hunger for information i made proposals to mr wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic layigure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon declined that course of instruction though not until mr wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe this statement sounds so well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained i wanted to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my society and less open to estella s reproach the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken slate and a short piece of slateencil were our educational implements to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco i never knew joe to remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my tuition any piece of information whatever yet he would smoke his pipe at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else even with a learned air as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely dear fellow i hope he did it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or waterine it was just the same miss havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head joe said i don t you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit well pip returned joe slowly considering what for what for joe what is any visit made for there is some wisits p r aps said joe as for ever remains open to the question pip but in regard to wisiting miss havisham she might think you wanted something expected something of her don t you think i might say that i did not joe you might old chap said joe and she might credit it similarly she mightn t joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss havisham done the handsome thing by you when miss havisham done the handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were all yes joe i heard her all joe repeated very emphatically yes joe i tell you i heard her which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning were make a end on it as you was me to the north and you to the south keep in sunders i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more probable but joe yes old chap here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after her or shown that i remember her that s true pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round and which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of hoofs i don t mean that sort of remembrance joe i don t mean a present but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door or say a gross or two of sharkeaded screws for general use or some light fancy article such as a toastingork when she took her muffins or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like i don t mean any present at all joe i interposed well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldn t no i would not for what s a doorhain when she s got one always up and sharkeaders is open to misrepresentations and if it was a toastingork you go into brass and do yourself no credit and the oncommonest workman can t show himself oncommon in a gridiron for a gridiron is a gridiron said joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave and you can t help yourself my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat don t go on in that way i never thought of making miss havisham any present no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all along and what i say to you is you are right pip yes joe but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack just now if you would give me a halfoliday toorrow i think i would go uptown and make a call on miss est havisham which her name said joe gravely ain t estavisham pip unless she have been rechris ened i know joe i know it was a slip of mine what do you think of it joe in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of it but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favour received then this experimental trip should have no successor by these conditions i promised to abide now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick he pretended that his christian name was dolge a clear impossibility but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding he was a broadshouldered looseimbed swarthy fellow of great strength never in a hurry and always slouching he never even seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere accident and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back he lodged at a sluiceeeper s out on the marshes and on workingays would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back on sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluiceates or stood against ricks and barns he always slouched locomotively with his eyes on the ground and when accosted or otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a halfesentful halfuzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking this morose journeyman had no liking for me when i was very small and timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and that i might consider myself fuel when i became joe s prentice orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him howbeit he liked me still less not that he ever said anything or did anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came in out of time dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of my halfoliday he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by and by he said leaning on his hammer now master sure you re not aoing to favour only one of us if young pip has a halfoliday do as much for old orlick i suppose he was about fivendwenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person why what you do with a halfoliday if you get it said joe what i do with it what he do with it i do as much with it as him said orlick as to pip he s going up town said joe well then as to old orlick he s aoing up town retorted that worthy two can go up town tain t only one wot can go up town don t lose your temper said joe shall if i like growled orlick some and their uptowning now master come no favouring in this shop be a man the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a redot bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it out as if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting blood and finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he again leaned on his hammer now master are you all right now demanded joe ah i am all right said gruff old orlick then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said joe let it be a halfoliday for all my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearing she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener and she instantly looked in at one of the windows like you you fool said she to joe giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in that way i wish i was his master you be everybody s master if you durst retorted orlick with an illavoured grin let her alone said joe i be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister beginning to work herself into a mighty rage and i couldn t be a match for the noodles without being a match for your master who s the dundereaded king of the noodles and i couldn t be a match for the rogues without being a match for you who are the blackestooking and the worst rogue between this and france now you re a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman if that makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a good un let her alone will you said joe what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream what did you say what did that fellow orlick say to me pip what did he call me with my husband standing by oh oh oh each of these exclamations was a shriek and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it and became blindly furious by regular stages what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me oh hold me oh ah growled the journeyman between his teeth i hold you if you was my wife i hold you under the pump and choke it out of you i tell you let her alone said joe oh to hear him cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a scream together which was her next stage to hear the names he s giving me that orlick in my own house me a married woman with my husband standing by oh oh here my sister after a fit of clappings and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and threw her cap off and pulled her hair down which were the last stages on her road to frenzy being by this time a perfect fury and a complete success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and mrs joe and further whether he was man enough to come on old orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went at one another like two giants but if any man in that neighbourhood could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man orlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very soon among the coalust and in no hurry to come out of it then joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible at the window but who had seen the fight first i thin and who was carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joe s hair then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such a lull namely that it was sunday and somebody was dead i went upstairs to dress myself when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlick s nostrils which was neither expressive nor ornamental a pot of beer had appeared from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage pip such is life with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a bo i found myself again going to miss havisham s matters little here nor how i passed and repassed the gate many times before i could make up my mind to ring nor how i debated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should undoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back miss sarah pocket came to the gate no estella how then you here again said miss pocket what do you want when i said that i only came to see how miss havisham was sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in and presently brought the sharp message that i was to come up everything was unchanged and miss havisham was alone well said she fixing her eyes upon me i hope you want nothing you get nothing no indeed miss havisham i only wanted you to know that i am doing very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you there there with the old restless fingers come now and then come on your birthday ay she cried suddenly turning herself and her chair towards me you are looking round for estella hey i had been looking round in fact for estella and i stammered that i hoped she was well abroad said miss havisham educating for a lady far out of reach prettier than ever admired by all who see her do you feel that you have lost her there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a loss what to say she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me when the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnuthell countenance i felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything and that was all i took by that motion as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman who should come out of the bookshop but mr wopsle mr wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea no sooner did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me and insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlour as i knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better than none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into pumblechook s just as the street and the shops were lighting up as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i don t know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it took until halfast nine o clock that night and that when mr wopsle got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career i thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf after leaf ever since his course began this however was a mere question of length and wearisomeness what stung me was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self when barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic pumblechook s indignant stare so taxed me with it wopsle too took pains to present me in the worst light at once ferocious and maudlin i was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer monomania in my master s daughter to care a button for me and all i can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character even after i was happily hanged and wopsle had closed the book pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his head and saying take warning boy take warning as if it were a wellnown fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation provided i could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor it was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with mr wopsle on the walk home beyond town we found a heavy mist out and it fell wet and thick the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the lamp s usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on the fog we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we came upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house halloa we said stopping orlick there ah he answered slouching out i was standing by a minute on the chance of company you are late i remarked orlick not unnaturally answered well and you re late we have been said mr wopsle exalted with his late performance we have been indulging mr orlick in an intellectual evening old orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all went on together i asked him presently whether he had been spending his halfoliday up and down town yes said he all of it i come in behind yourself i didn t see you but i must have been pretty close behind you by the by the guns is going again at the hulks said i ay there s some of the birds flown from the cages the guns have been going since dark about you hear one presently in effect we had not walked many yards further when the wellemembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives a good night for cutting off in said orlick we be puzzled how to bring down a jailird on the wing toight the subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in silence mr wopsle as the illequited uncle of the evening s tragedy fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell orlick with his hands in his pockets slouched heavily at my side it was very dark very wet very muddy and so we splashed along now and then the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river i kept myself to myself and my thoughts mr wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game on bosworth field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury orlick sometimes growled beat it out beat it out old clem with a clink for the stout old clem i thought he had been drinking but he was not drunk thus we came to the village the way by which we approached it took us past the three jolly bargemen which we were surprised to find it being eleven o clock in a state of commotion with the door wide open and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about mr wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that a convict had been take but came running out in a great hurry there s something wrong said he without stopping up at your place pip run all what is it i asked keeping up with him so did orlick at my side i can t quite understand the house seems to have been violently entered when joe gargery was out supposed by convicts somebody has been attacked and hurt we were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen it was full of people the whole village was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there was joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me and so i became aware of my sister lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire destined never to be on the rampage again while she was the wife of joe chapter with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i took another view of the case which was more reasonable joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a quarter after eight o clock to a quarter before ten while he was there my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged good night with a farmabourer going home the man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense confusion when he tried to b than that it must have been before nine when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance the fire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the candle however had been blown out nothing had been taken away from any part of the house neither beyond the blowing out of the candle which stood on a table between the door and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck was there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such as she herself had made in falling and bleeding but there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot she had been struck with something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence as she lay on her face and on the ground beside her when joe picked her up was a convict s legron which had been filed asunder now joe examining this iron with a smith s eye declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago the hue and cry going off to the hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joe s opinion was corroborated they did not undertake to say when it had left the prisonhips to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here i believed the iron to be my convict s iron the iron i had seen and heard him filing at on the marshes but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use for i believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file now as to orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the evening he had been in divers companies in several publicouses and he had come back with myself and mr wopsle there was nothing against him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with everybody else about her ten thousand times as to the strange man if he had come back for his two bankotes there could have been no dispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look round it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise i suffered unspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story for months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning the contention came after all to this the secret was such an old one now had so grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it away in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealutlets as a monstrous invention however i temporized with myself of course for was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always done and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant the constables and the bow street men from london for this happened in the days of the extinct redaistcoated police were about the house for a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases they took up several obviously wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances also they stood about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as taking the culprit but not quite for they never did it long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very ill in bed her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her speech was unintelligible when at last she came round so far as to be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech as she was very bad handwriting apar a more than indifferent speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own mistakes however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient a tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind we were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us mr wopsle s greatunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a part of our establishment it may have been about a month after my sister s reappearance in the kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine figure of a woman as she once were pip biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did him good it was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew i and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered biddy s first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me i had tried hard at it but had made nothing of it thus it was again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sister s ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial lette and ran into the forge followed by joe and me why of course cried biddy with an exultant face don t you see it s him orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlick s slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it chapter i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to miss havisham i found miss sarah pocket still on duty at the gate i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words the interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was going and told me to come again on my next birthday i may mention at once that this became an annual custom i tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily if i expected more then and after that i took it so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingable glass that i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew older it stood still daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact it bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she was not beautiful she was common and could not be like estella but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweetempered she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty and very good it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring at writing some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem and seeing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down biddy said i how do you manage it either i am very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i don t know returned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me i was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketoney for similar investment though i have no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage no because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every chance you never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing i was your first teacher though wasn t i said she as she sewed biddy i exclaimed in amazement why you are crying no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing what put that in your head what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsle s greatunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditation with my confidence yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this in this kitchen ah poor thing replied biddy it was like her selforgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable that s sadly true well said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat my sister was never left alone now but joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out together it was summerime and lovely weather when we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way when we came to the riveride and sat down on the bank with the water rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of biddy into my inner confidence biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a gentleman o i wouldn t if i was you she returned i don t think it would answer biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman you know best pip but don t you think you are happier as you are biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am i am disgusted with my calling and with my life i have never taken to either since i was bound don t be absurd was i absurd said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows i am sorry for that i didn t mean to be i only want you to do well and to be comfortable well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be comfortable or anything but miserable there biddy unless i can lead a very different sort of life from the life i lead now that s a pity said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own i told her she was right and i knew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall if i could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was little i know it would have been much better for me you and i and joe would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine sunday quite different people i should have been good enough for you shouldn t i biddy biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for answer yes i am not overarticular it scarcely sounded flattering but i knew she meant well instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two see how i am going on dissatisfied and uncomfortable and what would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me so biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she remarked directing her eyes to the ships again who said it i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where i was going to it was not to be shuffled off now however and i answered the beautiful young lady at miss havisham s and she s more beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want to be a gentleman on her account having made this lunatic confession i began to throw my tornp grass into the river as if i had some thoughts of following it do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over biddy quietly asked me after a pause i don t know i moodily answered because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should think but you know best that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words and if it is to gain her over i should think but you know best she was not worth gaining over exactly what i myself had thought many times exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment but how could i a poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her dreadfully in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well all the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face upon my sleeve i cried a little exactly as i had done in the brewery yard and felt vaguely convinced that i was very much illsed by somebody or by everybody i can t say which i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt you could give me your confidence pip and i am glad of another thing and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it if your first teacher dear such a poor one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your teacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set but it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and it s of no use now so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a little farther or go home biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving her a kiss i shall always tell you everything till you re a gentleman said biddy you know i never shall be so that s always not that i have any occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i know as i told you at home the other night ah said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a little farther or go home i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very beautiful i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing beggar my neighbour by candleight in the room with the stopped clocks and being despised by estella i thought it would be very good for me if i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do and stick to it and make the best of it i asked myself the question whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable i was obliged to admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip what a fool you are we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed right biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy toay and somebody else toorrow she would have derived only pain and no pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine how could it be then that i did not like her much the better of the two biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me right i wish i could said biddy if i could only get myself to fall in love with you you don t mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance oh dear not at all said biddy don t mind me if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me but you never will you see said biddy it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before i therefore observed i was not quite sure of that but biddy said she was and she said it decisively in my heart i believed her to be right and yet i took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and get over a stile near a sluiceate there started up from the gate or from the rushes or from the which was quite in his stagnant wa old orlick halloa he growled where are you two going where should we be going but home well then said he i jiggered if i don t see you home this penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of his he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and convey an idea of something savagely damaging when i was younger i had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper don t let him come i don t like him as i did not like him either i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didn t want seeing home he received that piece of information with a yell of laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little distance curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account i asked her why she did not like him oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us because i i am afraid he likes me did he ever tell you he liked you i asked indignantly no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation i was very hot indeed upon old orlick s daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on myself but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly no biddy it makes no difference to me only i don t like it i don t approve of it nor i neither said biddy though that makes no difference to you exactly said i but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you biddy if he danced at you with your own consent i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that demonstration he had struck root in joe s establishment by reason of my sister s sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him dismissed he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i had reason to know thereafter and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated its confusion fifty thousandold by having states and seasons when i was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of selfespect and happiness at those times i would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company with biddy when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter my wits again scattered wits take a long time picking up and often before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities i dare say it never did run out however but was brought to a premature end as i proceed to relate chapter it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a saturday night there was a group assembled round the fire at the three jolly bargemen attentive to mr wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud of that group i was one a highly popular murder had been committed and mr wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows he gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description and identified himself with every witness at the inquest he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he barbarously bellowed i serve you out as the murderer he gave the medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and he piped and shook as the aged turnpikeeeper who had heard blows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness the coroner in mr wopsle s hands became timon of athens the beadle coriolanus he enjoyed himself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable in this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me looking on there was an expression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces well said the stranger to mr wopsle when the reading was done you have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer he looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically guilty of course said he out with it come sir returned mr wopsle without having the honour of your acquaintance i do say guilty upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur i know you do said the stranger i knew you would i told you so but now i ask you a question do you know or do you not know that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is proved proved to be guilty sir mr wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself i come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him don t evade the question either you know it or you don t know it which is it to be he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr wopsle as it were to mark him out before biting it again now said he do you know it or don t you know it certainly i know it replied mr wopsle certainly you know it then why didn t you say so at first now i ask you another question taking possession of mr wopsle as if he had a right to him do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been crossxamined mr wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped him what you won t answer the question yes or no now i try you again throwing his finger at him again attend to me are you aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been crossxamined come i only want one word from you yes or no mr wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him come said the stranger i help you you don t deserve help but i help you look at that paper you hold in your hand what is it what is it repeated mr wopsle eyeing it much at a loss is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner the printed paper you have just been reading from undoubtedly undoubtedly now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence i read that just now mr wopsle pleaded never mind what you read just now sir i don t ask you what you read just now you may read the lord s prayer backwards if you like and perhaps have done it before toay turn to the paper no no no my friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the bottom to the bottom we all began to think mr wopsle full of subterfuge well have you found it here it is said mr wopsle now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence come do you make that of it mr wopsle answered those are not the exact words not the exact words repeated the gentleman bitterly is that the exact substance yes said mr wopsle yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle and now i ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellowreature guilty unheard we all began to suspect that mr wopsle was not the man we had thought him and that he was beginning to be found out and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his finger at mr wopsle heavily that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help him god we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right from information i have received said he looking round at us as we all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you by name joseph or joe gargery which is the man here is the man said joe the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip is he here i am here i cried the stranger did not recognise me but i recognised him as the gentleman i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss havisham i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his deepet eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watchhain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had surveyed me at his leisure it will take a little time perhaps we had better go to your place of residence i prefer not to anticipate my communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards i have nothing to do with that amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen and in a wondering silence walked home while going along the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of his finger as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door our conference was held in the state parlour which was feebly lighted by one candle it began with the strange gentleman s sitting down at the table drawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocketook he then put up the pocketook and set the candle a little aside after peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was which my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london i am pretty well known i have unusual business to transact with you and i commence by explaining that it is not of my originating if my advice had been asked i should not have been here it was not asked and you see me here what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i do no less no more finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice you would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good you would want nothing for so doing lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pip s way said joe staring lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned mr jaggers the question is would you want anything do you want anything the answer is returned joe sternly no i thought mr jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness but i was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it very well said mr jaggers recollect the admission you have made and don t try to go from it presently who s aoing to try retorted joe i don t say anybody is do you keep a dog yes i do keep a dog bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better bear that in mind will you repeated mr jaggers shutting his eyes and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something now i return to this young fellow and the communication i have got to make is that he has great expectations joe and i gasped and looked at one another i am instructed to communicate to him said mr jaggers throwing his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentleman in a word as a young fellow of great expectations my dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale now mr pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have to say to you you are to understand first that it is the request of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear the name of pip you will have no objection i dare say to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition but if you have any objection this is the time to mention it my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection i should think not now you are to understand secondly mr pip that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the person chooses to reveal it i am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself when or where that intention may be carried out i cannot say no one can say it may be years hence now you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the communications you may have with me if you have a suspicion in your own breast keep that suspicion in your own breast it is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim this is not for you to inquire into the condition is laid down your acceptance of it and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions and for whom i am not otherwise responsible that person is the person from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by that person and by me again not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it this is the time to mention it speak out once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection i should think not now mr pip i have done with stipulations though he called me mr pip and began rather to make up to me he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement if he only chose to mention them we come next to mere details of arrangement you must know that although i have used the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with expectations only there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance you will please consider me your guardian oh for i was going to thank him i tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldn t render them it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage i said i had always longed for it never mind what you have always longed for mr pip he retorted keep to the record if you long for it now that s enough am i answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor is that it i stammered yes that was it good now your inclinations are to be consulted i don t think that wise mind but it s my trust have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and mr wopsle s greatunt so i replied in the negative there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think might suit the purpose said mr jaggers i don t recommend him observe because i never recommend anybody the gentleman i speak of is one mr matthew pocket ah i caught at the name directly miss havisham s relation the matthew whom mr and mrs camilla had spoken of the matthew whose place was to be at miss havisham s head when she lay dead in her bride s dress on the bride s table you know the name said mr jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer my answer was that i had heard of the name oh said he you have heard of the name but the question is what do you say of it i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation no my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very slowly recollect yourself not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once no no no it s very well done but it won t do you are too young to fix me with it recommendation is not the word mr pip try another correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention of mr matthew pocket that s more like it cried mr jaggers and i adde i would gladly try that gentleman good you had better try him in his own house the way shall be prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london when will you come to london i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionles that i supposed i could come directly first said mr jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in and they should not be workinglothes say this day week you want some money shall i leave you twenty guineas he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me this was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair he sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe well joseph gargery you look dumbfoundered i am said joe in a very decided manner it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember it were understood said joe and it are understood and it ever will be similar according but what said mr jaggers swinging his purse what if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation as compensation what for joe demanded for the loss of his services joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman i have often thought him since like the steamammer that can crush a man or pat an egghell in his combination of strength with gentleness pip is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to honour and fortun as no words can tell him but if you think as money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child what come to the forge and ever the best of friends o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i see you again with your muscular blacksmith s arm before your eyes and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away o dear good faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel s wing but i encouraged joe at the time i was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes and could not retrace the byaths we had trodden together i begged joe to be comforted for as he sai we had ever been the best of friends and as i sai we ever would be so joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but said not another word mr jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognised in joe the village idiot and in me his keeper when it was over he said weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance no half measures with me if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge to make you speak out and you shall have it if on the contrary you mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joe s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place bullaiting and badgering me come out which i meantersay as sech if you re a man come on which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay and stand or fall by i drew joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern that he were not aoing to be bullaited and badgered in his own place mr jaggers had risen when joe demonstrated and had backed near the door without evincing any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory remarks they were these well mr pip i think the sooner you leave here as you are to be a gentleman the better let it stand for this day week and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime you can take a hackneyoach at the stageoach office in london and come straight to me understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust i undertake i am paid for undertaking it and i do so now understand that finally understand that he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage i beg your pardon mr jaggers halloa said he facing round what s the matter i wish to be quite right mr jaggers and to keep to your directions so i thought i had better ask would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one i know about here before i go away no said he looking as if he hardly understood me i don t mean in the village only but up town no said he no objection i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the burning coals i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals and nothing was said for a long time my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her needleork before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe in the corner opposite my sister the more i looked into the glowing coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe the longer the silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak at length i got out joe have you told biddy no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip i would rather you told joe pip s a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in it biddy dropped her work and looked at me joe held his knees and looked at me i looked at both of them after a pause they both heartily congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that i rather resented i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy jo with the grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune it would all come out in good time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be very particular and joe still detaining his knees said ay ay i be ekervally partickler pip and then they congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that i didn t half like it infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened to the best of my belief those efforts entirely failed she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even repeated after biddy the words pip and property but i doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied with myself anyhow i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and about what they should do without me and all that and whenever i caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they often looked at me particularly bidd i felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me though heaven knows they never did by word or sign at those times i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to air the room the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which i had passed my life saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer five more days and then the day before the day they soon go yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beerug they soon go soon soon go said biddy i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that i come and put them on there or that i have them sent to mr pumblechook s it would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here mr and mrs hubble might like to see you in your new geneel figure too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices so might wopsle and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment that s just what i don t want joe they would make such a business of it such a coarse and common business that i couldn t bear myself ah that indeed pip said joe if you couldn t abear yourself biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sister s plate have you thought about when you show yourself to mr gargery and your sister and me you will show yourself to us won t you biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick that it s difficult to keep up with you she always were quick observed joe if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening most likely on the evening before i go away biddy said no more handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed when i got into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for ever it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in so often between the forge and miss havisham s and biddy and estella the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and the room was warm as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light it for him he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting for some reason or other he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once i would not have listened for more if i could have heard more so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever known looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joe s pipe floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joe not obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared together i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more chapter morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same what lay heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our approaching separation but they only referred to it when i did after breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free with all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off the marshes at once and get them done with as i passed the church i felt as i had felt during service in the mornin a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds i promised myself that i would do something for them one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roasteef and plumudding a pint of ale and a gallon of condescension upon everybody in the village if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge my comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might be veritably dead into the bargain no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these grazing cattle though they seemed in their dull manner to wear a more respectful air now and to face round in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations farewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood henceforth i was for london and greatness not for smith s work in general and for you i made my exultant way to the old battery and lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended me for estella fell asleep when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me smoking his pipe he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes and said as being the last time pip i thought i foller and joe i am very glad you did so thankee pip you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that i shall never forget you no no pip said joe in a comfortable tone i sure of that ay ay old chap bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in a man s mind to be certain on it but it took a bit of time to get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didn t it somehow i was not best pleased with joe s being so mightily secure of me i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said it does you credit pip or something of that sort therefore i made no remark on joe s first head merely saying as to his second that the tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i were one have you though said joe astonishing it s a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more when we had our lessons here isn t it well i don t know returned joe i so awful dull i only master of my own trade it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but it s no more of a pity now than it was this day twelvemonth don t you see what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station he was so perfectly innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to biddy in preference so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget her said i had a favour to ask of her and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of helping joe on a little how helping him on asked biddy with a steady sort of glance well joe is a dear good fellow in fact i think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived but he is rather backward in some things for instance biddy in his learning and his manners although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me o his manners won t his manners do then asked biddy plucking a blackurrant leaf my dear biddy they do very well here o they do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at the leaf in her hand hear me out but if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would hardly do him justice and don t you think he knows that asked biddy it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to that i said snappishly biddy what do you mean biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands and the smell of a blackurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane said have you never considered that he may be proud proud i repeated with disdainful emphasis o there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and shaking her head pride is not all of one kind well what are you stopping for said i not all of one kind resumed biddy he may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well and with respect to tell you the truth i think he is though it sounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you i did not expect to see this in you you are envious biddy and grudging you are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you can t help showing it if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so say so over and over again if you have the heart to think so if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous and superior tone don t put it off upon me i am very sorry to see it and it s a it s a bad side of human nature i did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of improving dear joe but after this i ask you nothing i am extremely sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated it s a it s a bad side of human nature whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at all times and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no difference in my remembrance of you yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither said biddy turning away her head i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i was righ and i walked down the little path away from biddy and biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supperime again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to biddy and we dropped the subject putting on the best clothes i had i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open and presented myself before mr trabb the tailor who was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me but called me in to him well said mr trabb in a hailellowellet kind of way how are you and what can i do for you mr trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feathereds and was slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up he was a prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags mr trabb said i it s an unpleasant thing to have to mention because it looks like boasting but i have come into a handsome property a change passed over mr trabb he forgot the butter in bed got up from the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord bless my soul i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and i want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in i wish to pay for them i added otherwise i thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money my dear sir said mr trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow don t hurt me by mentioning that may i venture to congratulate you would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop mr trabb s boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryide when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his labours by sweeping over me he was still sweeping when i came out into the shop with mr trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles to express as i understood i equality with any blacksmith alive or dead hold that noise said mr trabb with the greatest sternness or i knock your head off do me the favour to be seated sir now this said mr trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss is a very sweet article i can recommend it for your purpose sir because it really is extra super but you shall see some others give me number four you to the boy and with a dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreant s brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity mr trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight and let me have none of your tricks here said mr trabb or you shall repent it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live mr trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellowownsman s if he might claim me for a fellowownsma having worn are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said mr trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and bring them myself i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr trabb s judgment and rentered the parlour to be measured for although mr trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented with it he said apologetically that it wouldn t do under existing circumstances sir wouldn t do at all so mr trabb measured and calculated me in the parlour as if i were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to mr pumblechook s on the thursday evening he said with his hand upon the parlour lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be expected to patronise local work as a rule but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem it goodorning sir much obliged door the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what it meant but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was that it had morally laid upon his back trabb s boy after this memorable event i went to the hatter s and the bootmaker s and the hosier s and felt rather like mother hubbard s dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades i also went to the coachffice and took my place for seven o clock on saturday morning it was not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome property but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me when i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards pumblechook s and as i approached that gentleman s place of business i saw him standing at his door he was waiting for me with great impatience he had been out early with the chaiseart and had called at the forge and heard the news he had prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlour and he too ordered his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed my dear friend said mr pumblechook taking me by both hands when he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good fortune well deserved well deserved this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of expressing himself to think said mr pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this is a proud reward i begged mr pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted on that point my dear young friend said mr pumblechook if you will allow me to call you so i murmured certainly and mr pumblechook took me by both hands again and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before the mind of joseph joseph said mr pumblechook in the way of a compassionate adjuration joseph joseph thereupon he shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph but my dear young friend said mr pumblechook you must be hungry you must be exhausted be seated here is a chicken had round from the boar here is a tongue had round from the boar here s one or two little things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise but do i said mr pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy infancy and may i may i this may i meant might he shake hands i consented and he was fervent and then sat down again here is wine said mr pumblechook let us drink thanks to fortune and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment and yet i cannot said mr pumblechook getting up again see afore me one and likewise drink to one without again expressing may i may i i said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass and turned it upside down i did the same and if i had turned myself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to my head mr pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of tongue none of those outfheay no thoroughfares of pork no and took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all ah poultry poultry you little thought said mr pumblechook apostrophising the fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for you you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as call it a weakness if you will said mr pumblechook getting up again but may i may i it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he did it at once how he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife i don t know and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had the honour of bringing you up by hand it s a sad picter to reflect that she s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour may i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him we drink her health said i ah cried mr pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid with admiration that s the way you know em sir i don t know who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person presen that s the way you know the nobleinded sir ever forgiving and ever affable it might said the servile pumblechook putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person have the appearance of repeating but may i when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister let us never be blind said mr pumblechook to her faults of temper but it is to be hoped she meant well at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting i mentioned to mr pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him i mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village and he lauded it to the skies there was nobody but himself he intimated worthy of my confidence and in short might he then he asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend if i had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea yet for all that i remember feeling convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a sensible practical goodearted prime fellow by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs he mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighbourhood what alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital those were the two little words more capital now it appeared to him pumblechoo that if that capital were got into the business through a sleeping partner sir which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the books and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket to the tune of fifty per cent it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property which would be worthy of his attention but what did i think he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think i gave it as my opinion wait a bit the united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me but said he really must and did we drank all the wine and mr pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep joseph up to the mark i don t know what mar and to render me efficient and constant service i don t know what servic he also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common fortun he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now and i said so too finally i went out into the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road there i was roused by mr pumblechook s hailing me he was a long way down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to stop i stopped and he came up breathless no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech not if i can help it this occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part may i as an old friend and wellisher may i we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation then he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the road and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before i pursued my way home i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little i possessed was adapted to my new station but i began packing that same afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i went to mr pumblechook s to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to miss havisham mr pumblechook s own room was given up to me to dress in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event my clothes were rather a disappointment of course probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a trifle short of the wearer s expectation but after i had had my new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of posturing with mr pumblechook s very limited dressinglass in the futile endeavour to see my legs it seemed to fit me better it being market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off mr pumblechook was not at home i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing this was all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a personal disadvantage something like joe s in his sunday suit i went circuitously to miss havisham s by all the back ways and rang at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed her walnuthell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow you said she you good gracious what do you want i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say goodye to miss havisham i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went to ask if i were to be admitted after a very short delay she returned and took me up staring at me all the way miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table leaning on her crutch stick the room was lighted as of yore and at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned she was then just abreast of the rotted brideake don t go sarah she said well pip i start for london miss havisham toorrow i was exceedingly careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you this is a gay figure pip said she making her crutch stick play round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were bestowing the finishing gift i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss havisham i murmured and i am so grateful for it miss havisham ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious sarah with delight i have seen mr jaggers i have heard about it pip so you go toorrow yes miss havisham and you are adopted by a rich person yes miss havisham not named no miss havisham and mr jaggers is made your guardian yes miss havisham she quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her enjoyment of sarah pocket s jealous dismay well she went on you have a promising career before you be good deserve it and abide by mr jaggers s instructions she looked at me and looked at sarah and sarah s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile goodye pip you will always keep the name of pip you know yes miss havisham goodye pip she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to my lips i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came naturally to me at the moment to do this she looked at sarah pocket with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten brideake that was hidden in cobwebs sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen out she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree confounded i said goodye miss pocket but she merely stared and did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken clear of the house i made the best of my way back to pumblechook s took off my new clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress carrying it to speak the truth much more at my ease too though i had the bundle to carry and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had run out fast and were gone and toorrow looked me in the face more steadily than i could look at it as the six evenings had dwindled away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more appreciative of the society of joe and biddy on this last evening i dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my splendour until bedtime we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with we were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little handortmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all alone i am afraid sore afraid that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to the coach together i had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me in the morning i did not all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now pigs now men never horses fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing then i got up and partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in taking it fell asleep biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy called to me that i was late it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it i got up from the meal saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me well i suppose i must be off and then i kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed biddy and threw my arms around joe s neck then i took up my little portmanteau and walked out the last i saw of them was when i presently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe i stopped then to wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head crying huskily hooroar and biddy put her apron to her face i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high street i whistled and made nothing of going but the village was very peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave and sob i broke into tears it was by the fingerost at the end of the village and i laid my hand upon it and said goodye o my dear dear friend heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts i was better after i had cried than before more sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle if i had cried before i should have had joe with me then so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at home and a better parting we changed and i had not made up my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back when we changed again and while i was occupied with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat high as if he could possibly be there we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to go back and i went on and the mists had all solemnly risen now and the world lay spread before me this is the end of the first stage of pip s expectations
