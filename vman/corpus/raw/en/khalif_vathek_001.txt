william beckford born in the year before the accession of king george the third was the son of an alderman who became twice lord mayor of london his family originally of gloucestershire had thriven by the plantations in jamaica and his father sent to school in england and forming a school friendship at westminster with lord mansfield began the world in this country as a merchant with inheritance of an enormous west india fortune william beckford the elder became magistrate member of parliament alderman four years before the birth of william beckford the younger he became one of the sheriffs of london and three years after his son s birth he was lord mayor as mayor he gave very sumptuous dinners that made epochs in the lives of feeding men his son s famous history of the caliph vathek looks as if it had been planned for an alderman s dream after a very heavy dinner at the mansion house there is devotion in it to the senses emphasis on heavy dining vathek piqued himself on being the greatest eater alive but when the indian dined with him though the tables were thirty times covered there was still want of more food for the voracious guest there is thirst for at one part of the dream when vathek s mother his wives and some eunuchs assiduously employed themselves in filling bowls of rock crystal and emulously presented them to him it frequently happened that his avidity exceeded their zeal insomuch that he would prostrate himself upon the ground to lap up the water of which he could never have enough and the nightmare incidents of the arabian tale all culminate in a most terrible heartburn could the conception of vathek have first come to the son after a city dinner though a magnificent host the elder beckford was no glutton in the year of his first mayoralty beckford stood by the side of alderman wilkes attacked for his no of the north briton as champion of the popular cause when he had been again elected to the mayoralty beckford on the rd of may went up to king george the third at the head of the aldermen and livery with an address which the king snubbed with a short answer beckford asked leave to reply and before his majesty recovered breath from his astonishment proceeded to reply in words that remain graven in gold upon his monument in guildhall young beckford the author of vathek was then a boy not quite eleven years old an only son and he was left three years afterwards by his father s death heir to an income of a hundred thousand a year with a million of cash in hand during his minority young beckford s mother who was a granddaughter of the sixth earl of abercorn placed him under a private tutor he was taught music by mozart and the earl of chatham who had been his father s friend thought him so fanciful a boy all air and fire that he advised his mother to keep the arabian nights out of his way happily she could not for vathek adds the thousand and second to the thousand and one tales with the difference that it joins to wild inventions in the spirit of the east touches of playful extravagance that could come only from an english humourist who sometimes laughed at his own tale and did not mind turning its comic side to the reader the younger william beckford had been born at his father s seat in wiltshire fonthill abbey and at seventeen amused himself with a caricature history of extraordinary painters encouraging the houseeeper of fonthill to show the pictures to visitors as works of og of basan and other worthies in her usual edifying manner young beckford s education was continued for a year and a half at geneva he then travelled in italy and the low countries and it was at this time that he amused himself by writing at the age of about twentywo vathek in french at a single sitting but he gave his mind to it and the sitting lasted three days and two nights an english version of it was made by a stranger and published without permission in beckford himself published his tale at paris and lausanne in one year after the death of a wife to whom he had been three years married and who left him with two daughters beckford went to portugal and spain returned to france and was present at the storming of the bastille he was often abroad he bought gibbon s library at lausanne and shut himself up with it for a time having a notion of reading it through he was occasionally in parliament but did not care for that kind of amusement he wrote pieces of less enduring interest than vathek including two burlesques upon the sentimental novel of his time in he settled down at fonthill and began to spend there abundantly on building and rebuilding perhaps he thought of vathek s tower when he employed workmen day and night to build a tower for himself three hundred feet high and set them to begin it again when it fell down he is said to have spent upon fonthill a quarter of a million living there in much seclusion during the last twenty years of his life he died in the happy thought of this william beckford s life was vathek it is a story that paints neither man nor outward nature as they are but reproduces with happy vivacity the luxuriant imagery and wild incidents of an arabian tale there is a ghost of a moral in the story of a sensual caliph going to the bad as represented by his final introduction to the halls of eblis but the enjoyment given by the book reflects the real enjoyment that the author had in writing it enjoyment great enough to cause it to be written at a heat in one long sitting without flagging power young and lively he delivered himself up to a free run of fancy revelled in the piledp enormities of the wicked mother who had not brought up vathek properly and certainly wrote some parts of his nightmare tale as merrily as if he were designing matter for a pantomime whoever in reading vathek takes it altogether seriously does not read it as it was written we must have an eye for the vein of caricature that now and then comes to the surface and invites a laugh without disturbing the sense of eastern extravagance bent seriously upon the elaboration of a tale crowded with incident and action taken altogether seriously the book has faults of construction but the faults turn into beauties when we catch the twinkle in the writer s eye h the history of the caliph vathek vathek ninth caliph of the race of the abassides was the son of motassem and the grandson of haroun al raschid from an early accession to the throne and the talents he possessed to adorn it his subjects were induced to expect that his reign would be long and happy his figure was pleasing and majestic but when he was angry one of his eyes became so terrible that no person could bear to behold it and the wretch upon whom it was fixed instantly fell backward and sometimes expired for fear however of depopulating his dominions and making his palace desolate he but rarely gave way to his anger being much addicted to women and the pleasures of the table he sought by his affability to procure agreeable companions and he succeeded the better as his generosity was unbounded and his indulgences unrestrained for he was by no means scrupulous nor did he think with the caliph omar ben abdalaziz that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to enjoy paradise in the next he surpassed in magnificence all his predecessors the palace of alkoremmi which his father motassem had erected on the hill of pied horses and which commanded the whole city of samarah was in his idea far too scanty he added therefore five wings or rather other palaces which he destined for the particular gratification of each of his senses in the first of these were tables continually covered with the most exquisite dainties which were supplied both by night and by day according to their constant consumption whilst the most delicious wines and the choicest cordials flowed forth from a hundred fountains that were never exhausted this palace was called the eternal or unsatiating banquet the second was styled the temple of melody or the nectar of the soul it was inhabited by the most skilful musicians and admired poets of the time who not only displayed their talents within but dispersing in bands without caused every surrounding scene to reverberate their songs which were continually varied in the most delightful succession the palace named the delight of the eyes or the support of memory was one entire enchantment rarities collected from every corner of the earth were there found in such profusion as to dazzle and confound but for the order in which they were arranged one gallery exhibited the pictures of the celebrated mani and statues that seemed to be alive here a wellanaged perspective attracted the sight there the magic of optics agreeably deceived it whilst the naturalist on his part exhibited in their several classes the various gifts that heaven had bestowed on our globe in a word vathek omitted nothing in this palace that might gratify the curiosity of those who resorted to it although he was not able to satisfy his own for he was of all men the most curious the palace of perfumes which was termed likewise the incentive to pleasure consisted of various halls where the different perfumes which the earth produces were kept perpetually burning in censers of gold flambeaux and aromatic lamps were here lighted in open day but the too powerful effects of this agreeable delirium might be avoided by descending into an immense garden where an assemblage of every fragrant flower diffused through the air the purest odours the fifth palace denominated the retreat of joy or the dangerous was frequented by troops of young females beautiful as the houris and not less seducing who never failed to receive with caresses all whom the caliph allowed to approach them for he was by no means disposed to be jealous as his own women were secluded within the palace he inhabited himself notwithstanding the sensuality in which vathek indulged he experienced no abatement in the love of his people who thought that a sovereign immersed in pleasure was not less tolerable to his subjects than one that employed himself in creating them foes but the unquiet and impetuous disposition of the caliph would not allow him to rest there he had studied so much for his amusement in the lifeime of his father as to acquire a great deal of knowledge though not a sufficiency to satisfy himself for he wished to know everything even sciences that did not exist he was fond of engaging in disputes with the learned but liked them not to push their opposition with warmth he stopped the mouths of those with presents whose mouths could be stopped whilst others whom his liberality was unable to subdue he sent to prison to cool their blood a remedy that often succeeded vathek discovered also a predilection for theological controversy but it was not with the orthodox that he usually held by this means he induced the zealots to oppose him and then persecuted them in return for he resolved at any rate to have reason on his side the great prophet mahomet whose vicars the caliphs are beheld with indignation from his abode in the seventh heaven the irreligious conduct of such a vicegerent let us leave him to himself said he to the genii who are always ready to receive his commands let us see to what lengths his folly and impiety will carry him if he run into excess we shall know how to chastise him assist him therefore to complete the tower which in imitation of nimrod he hath begun not like that great warrior to escape being drowned but from the insolent curiosity of penetrating the secrets of heaven he will not divine the fate that awaits him the genii obeyed and when the workmen had raised their structure a cubit in the dayime two cubits more were added in the night the expedition with which the fabric arose was not a little flattering to the vanity of vathek he fancied that even insensible matter showed a forwardness to subserve his designs not considering that the successes of the foolish and wicked form the first rod of their chastisement his pride arrived at its height when having ascended for the first time the eleven thousand stairs of his tower he cast his eyes below and beheld men not larger than pismires mountains than shells and cities than beeives the idea which such an elevation inspired of his own grandeur completely bewildered him he was almost ready to adore himself till lifting his eyes upward he saw the stars as high above him as they appeared when he stood on the surface of the earth he consoled himself however for this transient perception of his littleness with the thought of being great in the eyes of others and flattered himself that the light of his mind would extend beyond the reach of his sight and transfer to the stars the decrees of his destiny with this view the inquisitive prince passed most of his nights on the summit of his tower till he became an adept in the mysteries of astrology and imagined that the planets had disclosed to him the most marvellous adventures which were to be accomplished by an extraordinary personage from a country altogether unknown prompted by motives of curiosity he had always been courteous to strangers but from this instant he redoubled his attention and ordered it to be announced by sound of trumpet through all the streets of samarah that no one of his subjects on peril of displeasure should either lodge or detain a traveller but forthwith bring him to the palace not long after this proclamation there arrived in his metropolis a man so hideous that the very guards who arrested him were forced to shut their eyes as they led him along the caliph himself appeared startled at so horrible a visage but joy succeeded to this emotion of terror when the stranger displayed to his view such rarities as he had never before seen and of which he had no conception in reality nothing was ever so extraordinary as the merchandise this stranger produced most of his curiosities which were not less admirable for their workmanship than splendour had besides their several virtues described on a parchment fastened to each there were slippers which enabled the feet to walk knives that cut without the motion of a hand sabres which dealt the blow at the person they were wished to strike and the whole enriched with gems that were hitherto unknown the sabres whose blades emitted a dazzling radiance fixed more than all the caliph s attention who promised himself to decipher at his leisure the uncouth characters engraven on their sides without therefore demanding their price he ordered all the coined gold to be brought from his treasury and commanded the merchant to take what he pleased the stranger complied with modesty and silence vathek imagining that the merchant s taciturnity was occasioned by the awe which his presence inspired encouraged him to advance and asked him with an air of condescension who he was whence he came and where he obtained such beautiful commodities the man or rather monster instead of making a reply thrice rubbed his forehead which as well as his body was blacker than ebony four times clapped his paunch the projection of which was enormous opened wide his huge eyes which glowed like firebrands began to laugh with a hideous noise and discovered his long amberoloured teeth bestreaked with green the caliph though a little startled renewed his inquiries but without being able to procure a reply at which beginning to be ruffled he exclaimed knowest thou varlet who i am and at whom thou art aiming thy gibes then addressing his guards have ye heard him speak is he dumb he hath spoken they replied though but little let him speak again then said vathek and tell me who he is from whence he came and where he procured these singular curiosities or i swear by the ass of balaam that i will make him rue his pertinacity the menace was accompanied by the caliph with one of his angry and perilous glances which the stranger sustained without the slightest emotion although his eyes were fixed on the terrible eye of the prince no words can describe the amazement of the courtiers when they beheld this rude merchant withstand the encounter unshocked they all fell prostrate with their faces on the ground to avoid the risk of their lives and continued in the same abject posture till the caliph exclaimed in a furious tone up cowards seize the miscreant see that he be committed to prison and guarded by the best of my soldiers let him however retain the money i gave him it is not my intent to take from him his property i only want him to speak no sooner had he uttered these words than the stranger was surrounded pinioned with strong fetters and hurried away to the prison of the great tower which was encompassed by seven empalements of iron bars and armed with spikes in every direction longer and sharper than spits the caliph nevertheless remained in the most violent agitation he sat down indeed to eat but of the three hundred covers that were daily placed before him could taste of no more than thirtywo a diet to which he had been so little accustomed was sufficient of itself to prevent him from sleeping what then must be its effect when joined to the anxiety that preyed upon his spirits at the first glimpse of dawn he hastened to the prison again to importune this intractable stranger but the rage of vathek exceeded all bounds on finding the prison empty the gates burst asunder and his guards lying lifeless around him in the paroxysm of his passion he fell furiously on the poor carcases and kicked them till evening without intermission his courtiers and vizirs exerted their efforts to soothe his extravagance but finding every expedient ineffectual they all united in one vociferation the caliph is gone mad the caliph is out of his senses this outcry which soon resounded through the streets of samarah at length reaching the ears of carathis his mother she flew in the utmost consternation to try her ascendency on the mind of her son her tears and caresses called off his attention and he was prevailed upon by her entreaties to be brought back to the palace carathis apprehensive of leaving vathek to himself caused him to be put to bed and seating herself by him endeavoured by her conversation to heal and compose him nor could any one have attempted it with better success for the caliph not only loved her as a mother but respected her as a person of superior genius it was she who had induced him being a greek herself to adopt all the sciences and systems of her country which good mussulmans hold in such thorough abhorrence judicial astrology was one of those systems in which carathis was a perfect adept she began therefore with reminding her son of the promise which the stars had made him and intimated an intention of consulting them again alas sighed the caliph as soon as he could speak what a fool have i been not for the kicks bestowed on my guards who so tamely submitted to death but for never considering that this extraordinary man was the same the planets had foretold whom instead of illreating i should have conciliated by all the arts of persuasion the past said carathis cannot be recalled but it behoves us to think of the future perhaps you may again see the object you so much regret it is possible the inscriptions on the sabres will afford information eat therefore and take thy repose my dear son we will consider toorrow in what manner to act vathek yielded to her counsel as well as he could and arose in the morning with a mind more at ease the sabres he commanded to be instantly brought and poring upon them through a green glass that their glittering might not dazzle he set himself in earnest to decipher the inscriptions but his reiterated attempts were all of them nugatory in vain did he beat his head and bite his nails not a letter of the whole was he able to ascertain so unlucky a disappointment would have undone him again had not carathis by good fortune entered the apartment have patience son said she you certainly are possessed of every important science but the knowledge of languages is a trifle at best and the accomplishment of none but a pedant issue forth a proclamation that you will confer such rewards as become your greatness upon any one that shall interpret what you do not understand and what it is beneath you to learn you will soon find your curiosity gratified that may be said the caliph but in the meantime i shall be horribly disgusted by a crowd of smatterers who will come to the trial as much for the pleasure of retailing their jargon as from the hope of gaining the reward to avoid this evil it will be proper to add that i will put every candidate to death who shall fail to give satisfaction for thank heaven i have skill enough to distinguish between one that translates and one that invents of that i have no doubt replied carathis but to put the ignorant to death is somewhat severe and may be productive of dangerous effects content yourself with commanding their beards to be burnt beards in a state are not quite so essential as men the caliph submitted to the reasons of his mother and sending for morakanabad his prime vizir said let the common criers proclaim not only in samarah but throughout every city in my empire that whosoever will repair hither and decipher certain characters which appear to be inexplicable shall experience the liberality for which i am renowned but that all who fail upon trial shall have their beards burnt off to the last hair let them add also that i will bestow fifty beautiful slaves and as many jars of apricots from the isle of kirmith upon any man that shall bring me intelligence of the stranger the subjects of the caliph like their sovereign being great admirers of women and apricots from kirmith felt their mouths water at these promises but were totally unable to gratify their hankering for no one knew which way the stranger had gone as to the caliph s other requisition the result was different the learned the halfearned and those who were neither but fancied themselves equal to both came boldly to hazard their beards and all shamefully lost them the exaction of these forfeitures which found sufficient employment for the eunuchs gave them such a smell of singed hair as greatly to disgust the ladies of the seraglio and make it necessary that this new occupation of their guardians should be transferred into other hands at length however an old man presented himself whose beard was a cubit and a half longer than any that had appeared before him the officers of the palace whispered to each other as they ushered him in what a pity such a beard should be burnt even the caliph when he saw it concurred with them in opinion but his concern was entirely needless this venerable personage read the characters with facility and explained them verbatim as follows we were made where everything good is made we are the least of the wonders of a place where all is wonderful and deserving the sight of the first potentate on earth you translate admirably cried vathek i know to what these marvellous characters allude let him receive as many robes of honour and thousands of sequins of gold as he hath spoken words i am in some measure relieved from the perplexity that embarrassed me vathek invited the old main to dine and even to remain some days in the palace unluckily for him he accepted the offer for the caliph having ordered him next morning to be called said read again to me what you have read already i cannot hear too often the promise that is made me the completion of which i languish to obtain the old man forthwith put on his green spectacles but they instantly dropped from his nose on perceiving that the characters he had read the day preceding had given place to others of different import what ails you asked the caliph and why these symptoms of wonder sovereign of the world replied the old man these sabres hold another language toay from that they yesterday held how say you returned vathek but it matters not tell me if you can what they mean it is this my lord rejoined the old man woe to the rash mortal who seeks to know that of which he should remain ignorant and to undertake that which surpasseth his power and woe to thee cried the caliph in a burst of indignation toay thou art void of understanding begone from my presence they shall burn but the half of thy beard because thou wert yesterday fortunate in guessing my gifts i never resume the old man wise enough to perceive he had luckily escaped considering the folly of disclosing so disgusting a truth immediately withdrew and appeared not again but it was not long before vathek discovered abundant reason to regret his precipitation for though he could not decipher the characters himself yet by constantly poring upon them he plainly perceived that they every day changed and unfortunately no other candidate offered to explain them this perplexing occupation inflamed his blood dazzled his sight and brought on a giddiness and debility that he could not support he failed not however though in so reduced a condition to be often carried to his tower as he flattered himself that he might there read in the stars which he went to consult something more congenial to his wishes but in this his hopes were deluded for his eyes dimmed by the vapours of his head began to subserve his curiosity so ill that he beheld nothing but a thick dun cloud which he took for the most direful of omens agitated with so much anxiety vathek entirely lost all firmness a fever seized him and his appetite failed instead of being one of the greatest eaters he became as distinguished for drinking so insatiable was the thirst which tormented him that his mouth like a funnel was always open to receive the various liquors that might be poured into it and especially cold water which calmed him more than every other this unhappy prince being thus incapacitated for the enjoyment of any pleasure commanded the palaces of the five senses to be shut up forbore to appear in public either to display his magnificence or administer justice and retired to the inmost apartment of his harem as he had ever been an indulgent husband his wives overwhelmed with grief at his deplorable situation incessantly offered their prayers for his health and unremittingly supplied him with water in the meantime the princess carathis whose affliction no words can describe instead of restraining herself to sobbing and tears was closeted daily with the vizir morakanabad to find out some cure or mitigation of the caliph s disease under the persuasion that it was caused by enchantment they turned over together leaf by leaf all the books of magic that might point out a remedy and caused the horrible stranger whom they accused as the enchanter to be everywhere sought for with the strictest diligence at the distance of a few miles from samarah stood a high mountain whose sides were swarded with wild thyme and basil and its summit overspread with so delightful a plain that it might be taken for the paradise destined for the faithful upon it grew a hundred thickets of eglantine and other fragrant shrubs a hundred arbours of roses jessamine and honeysuckle as many clumps of orange trees cedar and citron whose branches interwoven with the palm the pomegranate and the vine presented every luxury that could regale the eye or the taste the ground was strewed with violets hareells and pansies in the midst of which sprang forth tufts of jonquils hyacinths and carnations with every other perfume that impregnates the air four fountains not less clear than deep and so abundant as to slake the thirst of ten armies seemed profusely placed here to make the scene more resemble the garden of eden which was watered by the four sacred rivers here the nightingale sang the birth of the rose her welleloved and at the same time lamented its shortived beauty whilst the turtle deplored the loss of more substantial pleasures and the wakeful lark hailed the rising light that renimates the whole creation here more than anywhere the mingled melodies of birds expressed the various passions they inspired as if the exquisite fruits which they pecked at pleasure had given them a double energy to this mountain vathek was sometimes brought for the sake of breathing a purer air and especially to drink at will of the four fountains which were reputed in the highest degree salubrious and sacred to himself his attendants were his mother his wives and some eunuchs who assiduously employed themselves in filling capacious bowls of rock crystal and emulously presenting them to him but it frequently happened that his avidity exceeded their zeal insomuch that he would prostrate himself upon the ground to lap up the water of which he could never have enough one day when this unhappy prince had been long lying in so debasing a posture a voice hoarse but strong thus addressed him why assumest thou the function of a dog o caliph so proud of thy dignity and power at this apostrophe he raised his head and beheld the stranger that had caused him so much affliction inflamed with anger at the sight he exclaimed accursed giaour what comest thou hither to do is it not enough to have transformed a prince remarkable for his agility into one of those leather barrels which the bedouin arabs carry on their camels when they traverse the deserts perceivest thou not that i may perish by drinking to excess no less than by a total abstinence drink then this draught said the stranger as he presented to him a phial of a red and yellow mixture and to satiate the thirst of thy soul as well as of thy body know that i am an indian but from a region of india which is wholly unknown the caliph delighted to see his desires accomplished in part and flattering himself with the hope of obtaining their entire fulfilment without a moment s hesitation swallowed the potion and instantaneously found his health restored his thirst appeased and his limbs as agile as ever in the transports of his joy vathek leaped upon the neck of the frightful indian and kissed his horrid mouth and hollow cheeks as though they had been the coral lips and the lilies and roses of his most beautiful wives whilst they less terrified than jealous at the sight dropped their veils to hide the blush of mortification that suffused their foreheads nor would the scene have closed here had not carathis with all the art of insinuation a little repressed the raptures of her son having prevailed upon him to return to samarah she caused a herald to precede him whom she commanded to proclaim as loudly as possible the wonderful stranger hath appeared again he hath healed the caliph he hath spoken he hath spoken forthwith all the inhabitants of this vast city quitted their habitations and ran together in crowds to see the procession of vathek and the indian whom they now blessed as much as they had before execrated incessantly shouting he hath healed our sovereign he hath spoken he hath spoken nor were these words forgotten in the public festivals which were celebrated the same evening to testify the general joy for the poets applied them as a chorus to all the songs they composed the caliph in the meanwhile caused the palaces of the senses to be again set open and as he found himself prompted to visit that of taste in preference to the rest immediately ordered a splendid entertainment to which his great officers and favourite courtiers were all invited the indian who was placed near the prince seemed to think that as a proper acknowledgment of so distinguished a privilege he could neither eat drink nor talk too much the various dainties were no sooner served up than they vanished to the great mortification of vathek who piqued himself on being the greatest eater alive and at this time in particular had an excellent appetite the rest of the company looked round at each other in amazement but the indian without appearing to observe it quaffed large bumpers to the health of each of them sung in a style altogether extravagant related stories at which he laughed immoderately and poured forth extemporaneous verses which would not have been thought bad but for the strange grimaces with which they were uttered in a word his loquacity was equal to that of a hundred astrologers he ate as much as a hundred porters and caroused in proportion the caliph notwithstanding the table had been thirty times covered found himself incommoded by the voraciousness of his guest who was now considerably declined in the prince s esteem vathek however being unwilling to betray the chagrin he could hardly disguise said in a whisper to bababalouk the chief of his eunuchs you see how enormous his performances in every way are what would be the consequence should he get at my wives go redouble your vigilance and be sure look well to my circassians who would be more to his taste than all of the rest the bird of the morning had thrice renewed his song when the hour of the divan sounded vathek in gratitude to his subjects having promised to attend immediately rose from table and repaired thither leaning upon his vizir who could scarcely support him so disordered was the poor prince by the wine he had drunk and still more by the extravagant vagaries of his boisterous guest the vizirs the officers of the crown and of the law arranged themselves in a semicircle about their sovereign and preserved a respectful silence whilst the indian who looked as cool as if come from a fast sat down without ceremony on the step of the throne laughing in his sleeve at the indignation with which his temerity had filled the spectators the caliph however whose ideas were confused and his head embarrassed went on administering justice at haphazard till at length the prime vizir perceiving his situation hit upon a sudden expedient to interrupt the audience and rescue the honour of his master to whom he said in a whisper my lord the princess carathis who hath passed the night in consulting the planets informs you that they portend you evil and the danger is urgent beware lest this stranger whom you have so lavishly recompensed for his magical gewgaws should make some attempt on your life his liquor which at first had the appearance of effecting your cure may be no more than a poison of a sudden operation slight not this surmise ask him at least of what it was compounded whence he procured it and mention the sabres which you seem to have forgotten vathek to whom the insolent airs of the stranger became every moment less supportable intimated to his vizir by a wink of acquiescence that he would adopt his advice and at once turning towards the indian said get up and declare in full divan of what drugs the liquor was compounded you enjoined me to take for it is suspected to be poison add also the explanation i have so earnestly desired concerning the sabres you sold me and thus show your gratitude for the favours heaped on you having pronounced these words in as moderate a tone as a caliph well could he waited in silent expectation for an answer but the indian still keeping his seat began to renew his loud shouts of laughter and exhibit the same horrid grimaces he had shown them before without vouchsafing a word in reply vathek no longer able to brook such insolence immediately kicked him from the steps instantly descending repeated his blow and persisted with such assiduity as incited all who were present to follow his example every foot was aimed at the indian and no sooner had any one given him a kick than he felt himself constrained to reiterate the stroke the stranger afforded them no small entertainment for being both short and plump he collected himself into a ball and rolled round on all sides at the blows of his assailants who pressed after him wherever he turned with an eagerness beyond conception whilst their numbers were every moment increasing the ball indeed in passing from one apartment to another drew every person after it that came in its way insomuch that the whole palace was thrown into confusion and resounded with a tremendous clamour the women of the harem amazed at the uproar flew to their blinds to discover the cause but no sooner did they catch a glimpse of the ball than feeling themselves unable to refrain they broke from the clutches of their eunuchs who to stop their flight pinched them till they bled but in vain whilst themselves though trembling with terror at the escape of their charge were as incapable of resisting the attraction the indian after having traversed the halls galleries chambers kitchens gardens and stables of the palace at last took his course through the courts whilst the caliph pursuing him closer than the rest bestowed as many kicks as he possibly could yet not without receiving now and then one which his competitors in their eagerness designed for the ball carathis morakanabad and two or three old vizirs whose wisdom had hitherto withstood the attraction wishing to prevent vathek from exposing himself in the presence of his subjects fell down in his way to impede the pursuit but he regardless of their obstruction leaped over their heads and went on as before they then ordered the muezzins to call the people to prayers both for the sake of getting them out of the way and of endeavouring by their petitions to avert the calamity but neither of these expedients was a whit more successful the sight of this fatal ball was alone sufficient to draw after it every beholder the muezzins themselves though they saw it but at a distance hastened down from their minarets and mixed with the crowd which continued to increase in so surprising a manner that scarce an inhabitant was left in samarah except the aged the sick confined to their beds and infants at the breast whose nurses could run more nimbly without them even carathis morakanabad and the rest were all become of the party the shrill screams of the females who had broken from their apartments and were unable to extricate themselves from the pressure of the crowd together with those of the eunuchs jostling after them terrified lest their charge should escape from their sight increased by the execrations of husbands urging forward and menacing both kicks given and received stumblings and overthrows at every step in a word the confusion that universally prevailed rendered samarah like a city taken by storm and devoted to absolute plunder at last the cursed indian who still preserved his rotundity of figure after passing through all the streets and public places and leaving them empty rolled onwards to the plain of catoul and traversed the valley at the foot of the mountain of the four fountains as a continual fall of water had excavated an immense gulf in the valley whose opposite side was closed in by a steep acclivity the caliph and his attendants were apprehensive lest the ball should bound into the chasm and to prevent it redoubled their efforts but in vain the indian persevered in his onward direction and as had been apprehended glancing from the precipice with the rapidity of lightning was lost in the gulf below vathek would have followed the perfidious giaour had not an invisible agency arrested his progress the multitude that pressed after him were at once checked in the same manner and a calm instantaneously ensued they all gazed at each other with an air of astonishment and notwithstanding that the loss of veils and turbans together with torn habits and dust blended with sweat presented a most laughable spectacle there was not one smile to be seen on the contrary all with looks of confusion and sadness returned in silence to samarah and retired to their inmost apartments without ever reflecting that they had been impelled by an invisible power into the extravagance for which they reproached themselves for it is but just that men who so often arrogate to their own merit the good of which they are but instruments should attribute to themselves the absurdities which they could not prevent the caliph was the only person that refused to leave the valley he commanded his tents to be pitched there and stationed himself on the very edge of the precipice in spite of the representations of carathis and morakanabad who pointed out the hazard of its brink giving way and the vicinity to the magician that had so severely tormented him vathek derided all their remonstrances and having ordered a thousand flambeaux to be lighted and directed his attendants to proceed in lighting more lay down on the slippery margin and attempted by help of this artificial splendour to look through that gloom which all the fires of the empyrean had been insufficient to pervade one while he fancied to himself voices arising from the depth of the gulf at another he seemed to distinguish the accents of the indian but all was no more than the hollow murmur of waters and the din of the cataracts that rushed from steep to steep down the sides of the mountain having passed the night in this cruel perturbation the caliph at daybreak retired to his tent where without taking the least sustenance he continued to doze till the dusk of evening began again to come on he then resumed his vigils as before and persevered in observing them for many nights together at length fatigued with so successless an employment he sought relief from change to this end he sometimes paced with hasty strides across the plain and as he wildly gazed at the stars reproached them with having deceived him but lo on a sudden the clear blue sky appeared streaked over with streams of blood which reached from the valley even to the city of samarah as this awful phenomenon seemed to touch his tower vathek at first thought of reairing thither to view it more distinctly but feeling himself unable to advance and being overcome with apprehension he muffled up his face in his robe terrifying as these prodigies were this impression upon him was no more than momentary and served only to stimulate his love of the marvellous instead therefore of returning to his palace he persisted in the resolution of abiding where the indian vanished from his view one night however while he was walking as usual on the plain the moon and the stars at once were eclipsed and a total darkness ensued the earth trembled beneath him and a voice came forth the voice of the giaour who in accents more sonorous than thunder thus addressed him wouldest thou devote thyself to me adore then the terrestrial influences and abjure mahomet on these conditions i will bring thee to the palace of subterranean fire there shalt thou behold in immense depositories the treasures which the stars have promised thee and which will be conferred by those intelligences whom thou shalt thus render propitious it was from thence i brought my sabres and it is there that soliman ben daoud reposes surrounded by the talismans that control the world the astonished caliph trembled as he answered yet in a style that showed him to be no novice in preternatural adventures where art thou be present to my eyes dissipate the gloom that perplexes me and of which i deem thee the cause after the many flambeaux i have burnt to discover thee thou mayst at least grant a glimpse of thy horrible visage abjure then mahomet replied the indian and promise me full proofs of thy sincerity otherwise thou shalt never behold me again the unhappy caliph instigated by insatiable curiosity lavished his promises in the utmost profusion the sky immediately brightened and by the light of the planets which seemed almost to blaze vathek beheld the earth open and at the extremity of a vast black chasm a portal of ebony before which stood the indian still blacker holding in his hand a golden key that caused the lock to resound how cried vathek can i descend to thee without the certainty of breaking my neck come take me and instantly open the portal not so fast replied the indian impatient caliph know that i am parched with thirst and cannot open this door till my thirst be thoroughly appeased i require the blood of fifty of the most beautiful sons of thy vizirs and great men or neither can my thirst nor thy curiosity be satisfied return to samarah procure for me this necessary libation come back hither throw it thyself into this chasm and then shalt thou see having thus spoken the indian turned his back on the caliph who incited by the suggestion of demons resolved on the direful sacrifice he now pretended to have regained his tranquillity and set out for samarah amidst the acclamations of a people who still loved him and forbore not to rejoice when they believed him to have recovered his reason so successfully did he conceal the emotion of his heart that even carathis and morakanabad were equally deceived with the rest nothing was heard of but festivals and rejoicings the ball which no tongue had hitherto ventured to mention was again brought on the tapis a general laugh went round though many still smarting under the hands of the surgeon from the hurts received in that memorable adventure had no great reason for mirth the prevalence of this gay humour was not a little grateful to vathek as perceiving how much it conduced to his project he put on the appearance of affability to every one but especially to his vizirs and the grandees of his court whom he failed not to regale with a sumptuous banquet during which he insensibly inclined the conversation to the children of his guests having asked with a goodatured air who of them were blessed with the handsomest boys every father at once asserted the pretensions of his own and the contest imperceptibly grew so warm that nothing could have withholden them from coming to blows but their profound reverence for the person of the caliph under the pretence therefore of reconciling the disputants vathek took upon him to decide and with this view commanded the boys to be brought it was not long before a troop of these poor children made their appearance all equipped by their fond mothers with such ornaments as might give the greatest relief to their beauty or most advantageously display the graces of their age but whilst this brilliant assemblage attracted the eyes and hearts of every one besides the caliph scrutinized each in his turn with a malignant avidity that passed for attention and selected from their number the fifty whom he judged the giaour would prefer with an equal show of kindness as before he proposed to celebrate a festival on the plain for the entertainment of his young favourites who he said ought to rejoice still more than all at the restoration of his health on account of the favours he intended for them the caliph s proposal was received with the greatest delight and soon published through samarah litters camels and horses were prepared women and children old men and young every one placed himself in the station he chose the cavalcade set forward attended by all the confectioners in the city and its precincts the populace following on foot composed an amazing crowd and occasioned no little noise all was joy nor did any one call to mind what most of them had suffered when they first travelled the road they were now passing so gaily the evening was serene the air refreshing the sky clear and the flowers exhaled their fragrance the beams of the declining sun whose mild splendour reposed on the summit of the mountain shed a glow of ruddy light over its green declivity and the white flocks sporting upon it no sounds were audible save the murmurs of the four fountains and the reeds and voices of shepherds calling to each other from different eminences the lovely innocents proceeding to the destined sacrifice added not a little to the hilarity of the scene they approached the plain full of sportiveness some coursing butterflies others culling flowers or picking up the shining little pebbles that attracted their notice at intervals they nimbly started from each other for the sake of being caught again and mutually imparting a thousand caresses the dreadful chasm at whose bottom the portal of ebony was placed began to appear at a distance it looked like a black streak that divided the plain morakanabad and his companions took it for some work which the caliph had ordered unhappy men little did they surmise for what it was destined vathek not liking they should examine it too nearly stopped the procession and ordered a spacious circle to be formed on this side at some distance from the accursed chasm the bodyuard of eunuchs was detached to measure out the lists intended for the games and prepare ringles for the lines to keep off the crowd the fifty competitors were soon stripped and presented to the admiration of the spectators the suppleness and grace of their delicate limbs their eyes sparkled with a joy which those of their fond parents reflected every one offered wishes for the little candidate nearest his heart and doubted not of his being victorious a breathless suspense awaited the contest of these amiable and innocent victims the caliph awaiting himself of the first moment to retire from the crowd advanced towards the chasm and there heard yet not without shuddering the voice of the indian who gnashing his teeth eagerly demanded where are they where are they perceivest thou not how my mouth waters relentless giaour answered vathek with emotion can nothing content thee but the massacre of these lovely victims ah wert thou to behold their beauty it must certainly move thy compassion perdition on thy compassion babbler cried the indian give them me instantly give them or my portal shall be closed against thee for ever not so loudly replied the caliph blushing i understand thee returned the giaour with the grin of an ogre thou wantest to summon up more presence of mind i will for a moment forbear during this exquisite dialogue the games went forward with all alacrity and at length concluded just as the twilight began to overcast the mountains vathek who was still standing on the edge of the chasm called out with all his might let my fifty little favourites approach me separately and let them come in the order of their success to the first i will give my diamond bracelet to the second my collar of emeralds to the third my aigret of rubies to the fourth my girdle of topazes and to the rest each a part of my dress even down to my slippers this declaration was received with reiterated acclamations and all extolled the liberality of a prince who would thus strip himself for the amusement of his subjects and the encouragement of the rising generation the caliph in the meantime undressed himself by degrees and raising his arm as high as he was able made each of the prizes glitter in the air but whilst he delivered it with one hand to the child who sprang forward to receive it he with the other pushed the poor innocent into the gulf where the giaour with a sullen muttering incessantly repeated more more this dreadful device was executed with so much dexterity that the boy who was approaching him remained unconscious of the fate of his forerunner and as to the spectators the shades of evening together with their distance precluded them from perceiving any object distinctly vathek having in this manner thrown in the last of the fifty and expecting that the giaour on receiving them would have presented the key already fancied himself as great as soliman and consequently above being amenable for what he had done when to his utter amazement the chasm closed and the around became as entire as the rest of the plain no language could express his rage and despair he execrated the perfidy of the indian loaded him with the most infamous invectives and stamped with his foot as resolving to be heard he persisted in this demeanour till his strength failed him and then fell on the earth like one void of sense his vizirs and grandees who were nearer than the rest supposed him at first to be sitting on the grass at play with their amiable children but at length prompted by doubt they advanced towards the spot and found the caliph alone who wildly demanded what they wanted our children our children cried they it is assuredly pleasant said he to make me accountable for accidents your children while at play fell from the precipice that was here and i should have experienced their fate had i not been saved by a sudden start back at these words the fathers of the fifty boys cried out aloud the mothers repeated their exclamations an octave higher whilst the rest without knowing the cause soon drowned the voices of both with still louder lamentations of their own our caliph said they and the report soon circulated our caliph has played us this trick to gratify his accursed giaour let us punish him for his perfidy let us avenge ourselves let us avenge the blood of the innocent let us throw this cruel prince into the gulf that is near and let his name be mentioned no more at this rumour and these menaces carathis full of consternation hastened to morakanabad and said vizir you have lost two beautiful boys and must necessarily be the most afflicted of fathers but you are virtuous save your master i will brave every hazard replied the vizir to rescue him from his present danger but afterwards will abandon him to his fate bababalouk continued he put yourself at the head of your eunuchs disperse the mob and if possible bring back this unhappy prince to his palace bababalouk and his fraternity felicitating each other in a low voice on their disability of ever being fathers obeyed the mandate of the vizir who seconding their exertions to the utmost of his power at length accomplished his generous enterprise and retired as he resolved to lament at his leisure no sooner had the caliph rentered his palace than carathis commanded the doors to be fastened but perceiving the tumult to be still violent and hearing the imprecations which resounded from all quarters she said to her son whether the populace be right or wrong it behoves you to provide for your safety let us retire to your own apartment and from thence through the subterranean passage known only to ourselves into your tower there with the assistance of the mutes who never leave it we may be able to make some resistance bababalouk supposing us to be still in the palace will guard its avenues for his own sake and we shall soon find without the counsels of that blubberer morakanabad what expedient may be the best to adopt vathek without making the least reply acquiesced in his mother s proposal and repeated as he went nefarious giaour where art thou hast thou not yet devoured those poor children where are thy sabres thy golden key thy talismans carathis who guessed from these interrogations a part of the truth had no difficulty to apprehend in getting at the whole as soon as he should be a little composed in his tower this princess was so far from being influenced by scruples that she was as wicked as woman could be which is not saying a little for the sex pique themselves on their superiority in every competition the recital of the caliph therefore occasioned neither terror nor surprise to his mother she felt no emotion but from the promises of the giaour and said to her son this giaour it must be confessed is somewhat sanguinary in his taste but the terrestrial powers are always terrible nevertheless what the one hath promised and the others can confer will prove a sufficient indemnification no crimes should be thought too dear for such a reward forbear then to revile the indian you have not fulfilled the conditions to which his services are annexed for instance is not a sacrifice to the subterranean genii required and should we not be prepared to offer it as soon as the tumult is subsided this charge i will take on myself and have no doubt of succeeding by means of your treasures which as there are now so many others in store may without fear be exhausted accordingly the princess who possessed the most consummate skill in the art of persuasion went immediately back through the subterranean passage and presenting herself to the populace from a window of the palace began to harangue them with all the address of which she was mistress whilst bababalouk showered money from both hands amongst the crowd who by these united means were soon appeased every person retired to his home and carathis returned to the tower prayer at break of day was announced when carathis and vathek ascended the steps which led to the summit of the tower where they remained for some time though the weather was lowering and wet this impending gloom corresponded with their malignant dispositions but when the sun began to break through the clouds they ordered a pavilion to be raised as a screen from the intrusion of his beams the caliph overcome with fatigue sought refreshment from repose at the same time hoping that significant dreams might attend on his slumbers whilst the indefatigable carathis followed by a party of her mutes descended to prepare whatever she judged proper for the oblation of the approaching night by secret stairs known only to herself and to her son she first repaired to the mysterious recesses in which were deposited the mummies that had been brought from the catacombs of the ancient pharaohs of these she ordered several to be taken from thence she resorted to a gallery where under the guard of fifty female negroes mute and blind of the right eye were preserved the oil of the most venomous serpents rhinoceros horns and woods of a subtle and penetrating odour procured from the interior of the indies together with a thousand other horrible rarities this collection had been formed for a purpose like the present by carathis herself from a presentment that she might one day enjoy some intercourse with the infernal powers to whom she had ever been passionately attached and to whose taste she was no stranger to familiarise herself the better with the horrors in view the princess remained in the company of her negresses who squinted in the most amiable manner from the only eye they had and leered with exquisite delight at the skulls and skeletons which carathis had drawn forth from her cabinets whose key she entrusted to no one all of them making contortions and uttering a frightful jargon but very amusing to the princess till at last being stunned by their gibbering and suffocated by the potency of their exhalations she was forced to quit the gallery after stripping it of a part of its treasures whilst she was thus occupied the caliph who instead of the visions he expected had acquired in these insubstantial regions a voracious appetite was greatly provoked at the negresses for having totally forgotten their deafness he had impatiently asked them for food and seeing them regardless of his demand he began to cuff pinch and push them till carathis arrived to terminate a scene so indecent to the great content of these miserable creatures who having been brought up by her understood all her signs and communicated in the same way their thoughts in return son what means all this said she panting for breath i thought i heard as i came up the shrieks of a thousand bats tearing from their crannies in the recesses of a cavern and it was the outcry only of these poor mutes whom you were so unmercifully abusing in truth you but ill deserve the admirable provision i have brought you give it me instantly exclaimed the caliph i am perishing for hunger as to that answered she you must have an excellent stomach if it can digest what i have been preparing be quick replied the caliph but oh heavens what horrors what do you intend come come returned carathis be not so squeamish but help me to arrange everything properly and you shall see that what you reject with such symptoms of disgust will soon complete your felicity let us get ready the pile for the sacrifice of toight and think not of eating till that is performed know you not that all solemn rites are preceded by a rigorous abstinence the caliph not daring to object abandoned himself to grief and the wind that ravaged his entrails whilst his mother went forward with the requisite operations phials of serpents oil mummies and bones were soon set in order on the balustrade of the tower the pile began to rise and in three hours was as many cubits high at length darkness approached and carathis having stripped herself to her inmost garment clapped her hands in an impulse of ecstasy and struck light with all her force the mutes followed her example but vathek extenuated with hunger and impatience was unable to support himself and fell down in a swoon the sparks had already kindled the dry wood the venomous oil burst into a thousand blue flames the mummies dissolving emitted a thick dun vapour and the rhinoceros horns beginning to consume all together diffused such a stench that the caliph recovering started from his trance and gazed wildly on the scene in full blaze around him the oil gushed forth in a plenitude of streams and the negresses who supplied it without intermission united their cries to those of the princess at last the fire became so violent and the flames reflected from the polished marble so dazzling that the caliph unable to withstand the heat and the blaze effected his escape and clambered up the imperial standard in the meantime the inhabitants of samarah scared at the light which shone over the city arose in haste ascended their roofs beheld the tower on fire and hurried half naked to the square their love to their sovereign immediately awoke and apprehending him in danger of perishing in his tower their whole thoughts were occupied with the means of his safety morakanabad flew from his retirement wiped away his tears and cried out for water like the rest bababalouk whose olfactory nerves were more familiarised to magical odours readily conjecturing that carathis was engaged in her favourite amusements strenuously exhorted them not to be alarmed him however they treated as an old poltroon and forbore not to style him a rascally traitor the camels and dromedaries were advancing with water but no one knew by which way to enter the tower whilst the populace was obstinate in forcing the doors a violent east wind drove such a volume of flame against them as at first forced them off but afterwards reindled their zeal at the same time the stench of the horns and mummies increasing most of the crowd fell backward in a state of suffocation those that kept their feet mutually wondered at the cause of the smell and admonished each other to retire morakanabad more sick than the rest remained in a piteous condition holding his nose with one hand he persisted in his efforts with the other to burst open the doors and obtain admission a hundred and forty of the strongest and most resolute at length accomplished their purpose having gained the staircase by their violent exertions they attained a great height in a quarter of an hour carathis alarmed at the signs of her mutes advanced to the staircase went down a few steps and heard several voices calling out from below you shall in a moment have water being rather alert considering her age she presently regained the top of the tower and bade her son suspend the sacrifice for some minutes adding we shall soon be enabled to render it more grateful certain dolts of your subjects imagining no doubt that we were on fire have been rash enough to break through those doors which had hitherto remained inviolate for the sake of bringing up water they are very kind you must allow so soon to forget the wrongs you have done them but that is of little moment let us offer them to the giaour let them come up our mutes who neither want strength nor experience will soon despatch them exhausted as they are with fatigue be it so answered the caliph provided we finish and i dine in fact these good people out of breath from ascending eleven thousand stairs in such haste and chagrined at having spilt by the way the water they had taken were no sooner arrived at the top than the blaze of the flames and the fumes of the mummies at once overpowered their senses it was a pity for they beheld not the agreeable smile with which the mutes and the negresses adjusted the cord to their necks these amiable personages rejoiced however no less at the scene never before had the ceremony of strangling been performed with so much facility they all fell without the least resistance or struggle so that vathek in the space of a few moments found himself surrounded by the dead bodies of his faithfullest subjects all which were thrown on the top of the pile carathis whose presence of mind never forsook her perceiving that she had carcases sufficient to complete her oblation commanded the chains to be stretched across the staircase and the iron doors barricaded that no more might come up no sooner were these orders obeyed than the tower shook the dead bodies vanished in the flames which at once changed from a swarthy crimson to a bright rose colour an ambient vapour emitted the most exquisite fragrance the marble columns rang with harmonious sounds and the liquefied horns diffused a delicious perfume carathis in transports anticipated the success of her enterprise whilst her mutes and negresses to whom these sweets had given the colic retired to their cells grumbling scarcely were they gone when instead of the pile horns mummies and ashes the caliph both saw and felt with a degree of pleasure which he could not express a table covered with the most magnificent repast flagons of wine and vases of exquisite sherbet floating on snow he availed himself without scruple of such an entertainment and had already laid hands on a lamb stuffed with pistachios whilst carathis was privately drawing from a filigree urn a parchment that seemed to be endless and which had escaped the notice of her son totally occupied in gratifying an importunate appetite he left her to peruse it without interruption which having finished she said to him in an authoritative tone put an end to your gluttony and hear the splendid promises with which you are favoured she then read as follows vathek my welleloved thou hast surpassed my hopes my nostrils have been regaled by the savour of thy mummies thy horns and still more by the lives devoted on the pile at the full of the moon cause the bands of thy musicians and thy tymbals to be heard depart from thy palace surrounded by all the pageants of majesty thy most faithful slaves thy best beloved wives thy most magnificent litters thy richest leaden camels and set forward on thy way to istakhar there await i thy coming that is the region of wonders there shalt thou receive the diadem of gian ben gian the talismans of soliman and the treasures of the predamite sultans there shalt thou be solaced with all kinds of delight but beware how thou enterest any dwelling on thy route or thou shalt feel the effects of my anger the caliph who notwithstanding his habitual luxury had never before dined with so much satisfaction gave full scope to the joy of these golden tidings and betook himself to drinking anew carathis whose antipathy to wine was by no means insuperable failed not to supply a reason for every bumper which they ironically quaffed to the health of mahomet this infernal liquor completed their impious temerity and prompted them to utter a profusion of blasphemies they gave a loose to their wit at the expense of the ass of balaam the dog of the seven sleepers and the other animals admitted into the paradise of mahomet in this sprightly humour they descended the eleven thousand stairs diverting themselves as they went at the anxious faces they saw on the square through the oilets of the tower and at length arrived at the royal apartments by the subterranean passage bababalouk was parading to and fro and issuing his mandates with great pomp to the eunuchs who were snuffing the lights and painting the eyes of the circassians no sooner did he catch sight of the caliph and his mother than he exclaimed hah you have then i perceive escaped from the flames i was not however altogether out of doubt of what moment is it to us what you thought or think cried carathis go speed tell morakanabad that we immediately want him and take care how you stop by the way to make your insipid reflections morakanabad delayed not to obey the summons and was received by vathek and his mother with great solemnity they told him with an air of composure and commiseration that the fire at the top of the tower was extinguished but that it had cost the lives of the brave people who sought to assist them still more misfortunes cried morakanabad with a sigh ah commander of the faithful our holy prophet is certainly irritated against us it behoves you to appease him we will appease him hereafter replied the caliph with a smile that augured nothing of good you will have leisure sufficient for your supplications during my absence for this country is the bane of my health i am disgusted with the mountain of the four fountains and am resolved to go and drink of the stream of rocnabad i long to refresh myself in the delightful valleys which it waters do you with the advice of my mother govern my dominions and take care to supply whatever her experiments may demand for you well know that our tower abounds in materials for the advancement of science the tower but ill suited morakanabad s taste immense treasures had been lavished upon it and nothing had he ever seen carried thither but female negroes mutes and abominable drugs nor did he know well what to think of carathis who like a chameleon could assume all possible colours her cursed eloquence had often driven the poor mussulman to his last shifts he considered however that if she possessed but few good qualities her son had still fewer and that the alternative on the whole would be in her favour consoled therefore with this reflection he went in good spirits to soothe the populace and make the proper arrangements for his master s journey vathek to conciliate the spirits of the subterranean palace resolved that his expedition should be uncommonly splendid with this view he confiscated on all sides the property of his subjects whilst his worthy mother stripped the seraglios she visited of the gems they contained she collected all the sempstresses and embroiderers of samarah and other cities to the distance of sixty leagues to prepare pavilions palanquins sofas canopies and litters for the train of the monarch there was not left in masulipatam a single piece of chintz and so much muslin had been bought up to dress out bababalouk and the other black eunuchs that there remained not an ell in the whole irak of babylon during these preparations carathis who never lost sight of her great object which was to obtain favour with the powers of darkness made select parties of the fairest and most delicate ladies of the city but in the midst of their gaiety she contrived to introduce serpents amongst them and to break pots of scorpions under the table they all bit to a wonder and carathis would have left them to bite were it not that to fill up the time she now and then amused herself in curing their wounds with an excellent anodyne of her own invention for this good princess abhorred being indolent vathek who was not altogether so active as his mother devoted his time to the sole gratification of his senses in the palaces which were severally dedicated to them he disgusted himself no more with the divan or the mosque one half of samarah followed his example whilst the other lamented the progress of corruption in the midst of these transactions the embassy returned which had been sent in pious times to mecca it consisted of the most reverend moullahs who had fulfilled their commission and brought back one of those precious besoms which are used to sweep the sacred caaba a present truly worthy of the greatest potentate on earth the caliph happened at this instant to be engaged in an apartment by no means adapted to the reception of embassies though adorned with a certain magnificence not only to render it agreeable but also because he resorted to it frequently and stayed a considerable time together whilst occupied in this retreat he heard the voice of bababalouk calling out from between the door and the tapestry that hung before it here are the excellent mahomet ebn edris al shafei and the seraphic al mouhadethin who have brought the besom from mecca and with tears of joy intreat they may present it to your majesty in person let them bring the besom hither it may be of use said vathek who was still employed not having quite racked off his wine how said bababalouk half aloud and amazed obey replied the caliph for it is my sovereign will go instantly vanish for here will i receive the good folk who have thus filled thee with joy the eunuch departed muttering and bade the venerable train attend him a sacred rapture was diffused amongst these reverend old men though fatigued with the length of their expedition they followed bababalouk with an alertness almost miraculous and felt themselves highly flattered as they swept along the stately porticoes that the caliph would not receive them like ambassadors in ordinary in his hall of audience soon reaching the interior of the harem where through blinds of persian they perceived large soft eyes dark and blue that went and came like lightnin penetrated with respect and wonder and full of their celestial mission they advanced in procession towards the small corridors that appeared to terminate in nothing but nevertheless led to the cell where the caliph expected their coming what is the commander of the faithful sick said ebn edris al shafei in a low voice to his companion i rather think he is in his oratory answered al mouhadethin vathek who heard the dialogue cried out what imports it you how i am employed approach without delay they advanced and bababalouk almost sunk with confusion whilst the caliph without showing himself put forth his hand from behind the tapestry that hung before the door and demanded of them the besom having prostrated themselves as well as the corridor would permit and even in a tolerable semicircle the venerable al shafei drawing forth the besom from the embroidered and perfumed scarves in which it had been enveloped and secured from the profane gaze of vulgar eyes arose from his associates and advanced with an air of the most awful solemnity towards the supposed oratory but with what astonishment with what horror was he seized vathek bursting out into a villainous laugh snatched the besom from his trembling hand and fixing upon some cobwebs that hung suspended from the ceiling gravely brushed away till not a single one remained the old men overpowered with amazement were unable to lift their beards from the ground for as vathek had carelessly left the tapestry between them half drawn they were witnesses to the whole transaction their tears gushed forth on the marble al mouhadethin swooned through mortification and fatigue whilst the caliph throwing himself backward on his seat shouted and clapped his hands without mercy at last addressing himself to bababalouk my dear black said he go regale these pious poor souls with my good wine from shiraz and as they can boast of having seen more of my palace than any one besides let them also visit my office courts and lead them out by the back steps that go to my stables having said this he threw the besom in their face and went to enjoy the laugh with carathis bababalouk did all in his power to console the ambassadors but the two most infirm expired on the spot the rest were carried to their beds from whence being heartroken with sorrow and shame they never arose the succeeding night vathek attended by his mother ascended the tower to see if everything were ready for his journey for he had great faith in the influence of the stars the planets appeared in their most favourable aspects the caliph to enjoy so flattering a sight supped gaily on the roof and fancied that he heard during his repast loud shouts of laughter resound through the sky in a manner that inspired the fullest assurance all was in motion at the palace lights were kept burning through the whole of the night the sound of implements and of artisans finishing their work the voices of women and their guardians who sung at their embroidery all conspired to interrupt the stillness of nature and infinitely delight the heart of vathek who imagined himself going in triumph to sit upon the throne of soliman the people were not less satisfied than himself all assisted to accelerate the moment which should rescue them from the wayward caprices of so extravagant a master the day preceding the departure of this infatuated prince was employed by carathis in repeating to him the decrees of the mysterious parchment which she had thoroughly gotten by heart and in recommending him not to enter the habitation of any one by the way for well thou knowest added she how liquorish thy taste is after good dishes and young damsels let me therefore enjoin thee to be content with thy old cooks who are the best in the world and not to forget that in thy ambulatory seraglio there are three dozen pretty faces which bababalouk hath not yet unveiled i myself have a great desire to watch over thy conduct and visit the subterranean palace which no doubt contains whatever can interest persons like us there is nothing so pleasing as retiring to caverns my taste for dead bodies and everything like mummy is decided and i am confident thou wilt see the most exquisite of their kind forget me not then but the moment thou art in possession of the talismans which are to open to thee the mineral kingdoms and the centre of the earth itself fail not to despatch some trusty genius to take me and my cabinet for the oil of the serpents i have pinched to death will be a pretty present to the giaour who cannot but be charmed with such dainties scarcely had carathis ended this edifying discourse when the sun setting behind the mountain of the four fountains gave place to the rising moon this planet being that evening at full appeared of unusual beauty and magnitude in the eyes of the women the eunuchs and the pages who were all impatient to set forward the city rechoed with shouts of joy and flourishing of trumpets nothing was visible but plumes nodding on pavilions and aigrets shining in the mild lustre of the moon the spacious square resembled an immense parterre variegated with the most stately tulips of the east arrayed in the robes which were only worn at the most distinguished ceremonials and supported by his vizir and bababalouk the caliph descended the grand staircase of the tower in the sight of all his people he could not forbear pausing at intervals to admire the superb appearance which everywhere courted his view whilst the whole multitude even to the camels with their sumptuous burdens knelt down before him for some time a general stillness prevailed which nothing happened to disturb but the shrill screams of some eunuchs in the rear these vigilant guards having remarked certain cages of the ladies swagging somewhat awry and discovered that a few adventurous gallants had contrived to get in soon dislodged the enraptured culprits the majesty of so magnificent a spectacle was not however violated by incidents like these vathek meanwhile saluted the moon with an idolatrous air that neither pleased morakanabad nor the doctors of the law any more than the vizirs and the grandees of his court who were all assembled to enjoy the last view of their sovereign at length the clarions and trumpets from the top of the tower announced the prelude of departure though the instruments were in unison with each other yet a singular dissonance was blended with their sounds this proceeded from carathis who was singing her direful orisons to the giaour whilst the negresses and mutes supplied thoroughase without articulating a word the good mussulmans fancied that they heard the sullen hum of those nocturnal insects which presage evil and importuned vathek to beware how he ventured his sacred person on a given signal the great standard of the califat was displayed twenty thousand lances shone around it and the caliph treading loyally on the cloth of gold which had been spread for his feet ascended his litter amidst the general awe that possessed his subjects the expedition commenced with the utmost order and so entire a silence that even the locusts were heard from the thickets on the plain of catoul gaiety and goodumour prevailing six good leagues were past before the dawn and the morning star was still glittering in the firmament when the whole of this numerous train had halted on the banks of the tigris where they encamped to repose for the rest of the day the three days that followed were spent in the same manner but on the fourth the heavens looked angry lightnings broke forth in frequent flashes rechoing peals of thunder succeeded and the trembling circassians clung with all their might to their ugly guardians the caliph himself was greatly inclined to take shelter in the large town of gulchissar the governor of which came forth to meet him and tendered every kind of refreshment the place could supply but having examined his tablets he suffered the rain to soak him almost to the bone notwithstanding the importunity of his first favourites though he began to regret the palace of the senses yet he lost not sight of his enterprise and his sanguine expectations confirmed his resolution his geographers were ordered to attend him but the weather proved so terrible that these poor people exhibited a lamentable appearance and as no long journeys had been undertaken since the time of haroun al raschid their maps of the different countries were in a still worse plight than themselves every one was ignorant which way to turn for vathek though well versed in the course of the heavens no longer knew his situation on earth he thundered even louder than the elements and muttered forth certain hints of the bowtring which were not very soothing to literary ears disgusted at the toilsome weariness of the way he determined to cross over the craggy heights and follow the guidance of a peasant who undertook to bring him in four days to rocnabad remonstrances were all to no purpose his resolution was fixed and an invasion commenced on the province of the goats who sped away in large troops before them it was curious to view on these half calcined rocks camels richly caparisoned and pavilions of gold and silk waving on their summits which till then had never been covered but with sapless thistles and fern the females and eunuchs uttered shrill wailings at the sight of the precipices below them and the dreary prospects that opened in the vast gorges of the mountains before they could reach the ascent of the steepest rock night overtook them and a boisterous tempest arose which having rent the awnings of the palanquins and cages exposed to the raw gusts the poor ladies within who had never before felt so piercing a cold the dark clouds that overcast the face of the sky deepened the horrors of this disastrous night insomuch that nothing could be heard distinctly but the mewling of pages and lamentations of sultanas to increase the general misfortune the frightful uproar of wild beasts resounded at a distance and there were soon perceived in the forest they were skirting the glaring of eyes which could belong only to devils or tigers the pioneers who as well as they could had marked out a track and a part of the advanced guard were devoured before they had been in the least apprized of their danger the confusion that prevailed was extreme wolves tigers and other carnivorous animals invited by the howling of their companions flocked together from every quarter the crashing of bones was heard on all sides and a fearful rush of wings overhead for now vultures also began to be of the party the terror at length reached the main body of the troops which surrounded the monarch and his harem at the distance of two leagues from the scene vathek voluptuously reposed in his capacious litter upon cushions of silk with two little pages beside him of complexions more fair than the enamel of franguestan who were occupied in keeping off flie was soundly asleep and contemplating in his dreams the treasures of soliman the shrieks however of his wives awoke him with a start and instead of the giaour with his key of gold he beheld bababalouk full of consternation sire exclaimed this good servant of the most potent of monarchs misfortune is arrived at its height wild beasts who entertain no more reverence for your sacred person than for that of a dead ass have beset your camels and their drivers thirty of the richest laden are already become their prey as well as your confectioners your cooks and purveyors and unless our holy prophet should protect us we shall have all eaten our last meal at the mention of eating the caliph lost all patience he began to bellow and even beat himself for there was no seeing in the dar the rumour every instant increased and bababalouk finding no good could be done with his master stopped both his ears against the hurlyurly of the harem and called out aloud come ladies and brothers all hands to work strike light in a moment never shall it be said that the commander of the faithful served to regale these infidel brutes though there wanted not in this bevy of beauties a sufficient number of capricious and wayward yet on the present occasion they were all compliance fires were visible in a twinkling in all their cages ten thousand torches were lighted at once the caliph himself seized a large one of wax every person followed his example and by kindling ropes ends dipped in oil and fastened on poles an amazing blaze was spread the rocks were covered with the splendour of sunshine the trails of sparks wafted by the wind communicated to the dry fern of which there was plenty serpents were observed to crawl forth from their retreats with amazement and hissings whilst the horses snorted stamped the ground tossed their noses in the air and plunged about without mercy one of the forests of cedar that bordered their way took fire and the branches that overhung the path extending their flames to the muslins and chintzes which covered the cages of the ladies obliged them to jump out at the peril of their necks vathek who vented on the occasion a thousand blasphemies was himself compelled to touch with his sacred feet the naked earth never had such an incident happened before full of mortification shame and despondence and not knowing how to walk the ladies fell into the dirt must i go on foot said one must i wet my feet cried another must i soil my dress asked a third execrable bababalouk exclaimed all outcast of hell what hadst thou to do with torches better were it to be eaten by tigers than to fall into our present condition we are for ever undone not a porter is there in the army nor a currier of camels but hath seen some part of our bodies and what is worse our very faces on saying this the most bashful amongst them hid their foreheads on the ground whist such as had more boldness flew at bababalouk but he well apprized of their humour and not wanting in shrewdness betook himself to his heels along with his comrades all dropping their torches and striking their tymbals it was not less light than in the brightest of the dogays and the weather was hot in proportion but how degrading was the spectacle to behold the caliph bespattered like an ordinary mortal as the exercise of his faculties seemed to be suspended one of his ethiopian wives for he delighted in variet clasped him in her arms threw him upon her shoulder like a sack of dates and finding that the fire was hemming them in set off with no small expedition considering the weight of her burden the other ladies who had just learnt the use of their feet followed her their guards galloped after and the camelrivers brought up the rear as fast as their charge would permit they soon reached the spot where the wild beasts had commenced the carnage and which they had too much spirit to leave notwithstanding the approaching tumult and the luxurious supper they had made bababalouk nevertheless seized on a few of the plumpest which were unable to budge from the place and began to flay them with admirable adroitness the cavalcade being got so far from the conflagration as that the heat felt rather grateful than violent it was immediately resolved on to halt the tattered chintzes were picked up the scraps left by the wolves and tigers interred and vengeance was taken on some dozens of vultures that were too much glutted to rise on the wing the camels which had been left unmolested to make sal ammoniac being numbered and the ladies once more enclosed in their cages the imperial tent was pitched on the levellest ground they could find vathek reposing upon a mattress of down and tolerably recovered from the jolting of the ethiopian who to his feelings seemed the roughest trotting jade he had hitherto mounted called out for something to eat but alas those delicate cakes which had been baked in silver ovens for his royal mouth those rich manchets amber comfits flagons of schiraz wine porcelain vases of snow and grapes from the banks of the tigris were all irremediably lost and nothing had bababalouk to present in their stead but a roasted wolf vultures la daube aromatic herbs of the most acrid poignancy rotten truffles boiled thistles and such other wild plants as most ulcerate the throat and parch up the tongue nor was he better provided in the article of drink for he could procure nothing to accompany these irritating viands but a few vials of abominable brandy which had been secreted by the scullions in their slippers vathek made wry faces at so savage a repast and bababalouk answered them with shrugs and contortions the caliph however ate with tolerable appetite and fell into a nap that lasted six hours the splendour of the sun reflected from the white cliffs of the mountains in spite of the curtains that enclosed him at length disturbed his repose he awoke terrified and stung to the quick by those wormwoodoloured flies which emit from their wings a suffocating stench the miserable monarch was perplexed how to act though his wits were not idle in seeking expedients whilst bababalouk lay snoring amidst a swarm of those insects that busily thronged to pay court to his nose the little pages famished with hunger had dropped their fans on the ground and exerted their dying voices in bitter reproaches on the caliph who now for the first time heard the language of truth thus stimulated he renewed his imprecations against the giaour and bestowed upon mahomet some soothing expressions where am i cried he what are these dreadful rocks these valleys of darkness are we arrived at the horrible kaf is the simurgh coming to pluck out my eyes as a punishment for undertaking this impious enterprise having said this he bellowed like a calf and turned himself towards an outlet in the side of his pavilion but alas what objects occurred to his view on one side a plain of black sand that appeared to be unbounded and on the other perpendicular crags bristled over with those abominable thistles which had so severely lacerated his tongue he fancied however that he perceived amongst the brambles and briers some gigantic flowers but was mistaken for these were only the dangling palampores and variegated tatters of his gay retinue as there were several clefts in the rock from whence water seemed to have flowed vathek applied his ear with the hope of catching the sound of some latent runnel but could only distinguish the low murmurs of his people who were repining at their journey and complaining for the want of water to what purpose asked they have we been brought hither hath our caliph another tower to build or have the relentless afrits whom carathis so much loves fixed in this place their abode at the name of carathis vathek recollected the tablets he had received from his mother who assured him they were fraught with preternatural qualities and advised him to consult them as emergencies might require whilst he was engaged in turning them over he heard a shout of joy and a loud clapping of hands the curtains of his pavilion were soon drawn back and he beheld bababalouk followed by a troop of his favourites conducting two dwarfs each a cubit high who brought between them a large basket of melons oranges and pomegranates they were singing in the sweetest tones the words that follow we dwell on the top of these rocks in a cabin of rushes and canes the eagles envy us our nest a small spring supplies us with abdest and we daily repeat prayers which the prophet approves we love you o commander of the faithful our master the good emir fakreddin loves you also he reveres in your person the vicegerent of mahomet little as we are in us he confides he knows our hearts to be good as our bodies are contemptible and hath placed us here to aid those who are bewildered on these dreary mountains last night whilst we were occupied within our cell in reading the holy koran a sudden hurricane blew out our lights and rocked our habitation for two whole hours a palpable darkness prevailed but we heard sounds at a distance which we conjectured to proceed from the bells of a cafila passing over the rocks our ears were soon filled with deplorable shrieks frightful roarings and the sound of tymbals chilled with terror we concluded that the deggial with his exterminating angels had sent forth their plagues on the earth in the midst of these melancholy reflections we perceived flames of the deepest red glow in the horizon and found ourselves in a few moments covered with flakes of fire amazed at so strange an appearance we took up the volume dictated by the blessed intelligence and kneeling by the light of the fire that surrounded us we recited the verse which says put no trust in anything but the mercy of heaven there is no help save in the holy prophet the mountain of kaf itself may tremble it is the power of allah only that cannot be moved after having pronounced these words we felt consolation and our minds were hushed into a sacred repose silence ensued and our ears clearly distinguished a voice in the air saying servants of my faithful servant go down to the happy valley of fakreddin tell him that an illustrious opportunity now offers to satiate the thirst of his hospitable heart the commander of true believers is this day bewildered amongst these mountains and stands in need of thy aid we obeyed with joy the angelic mission and our master filled with pious zeal hath culled with his own hands these melons oranges and pomegranates he is following us with a hundred dromedaries laden with the purest waters of his fountains and is coming to kiss the fringe of your consecrated robe and implore you to enter his humble habitation which placed amidst these barren wilds resembles an emerald set in lead the dwarfs having ended their address remained still standing and with hands crossed upon their bosoms preserved a respectful silence vathek in the midst of this curious harangue seized the basket and long before it was finished the fruits had dissolved in his mouth as he continued to eat his piety increased and in the same breath which recited his prayers he called for the koran and sugar such was the state of his mind when the tablets which were thrown by at the approach of the dwarfs again attracted his eye he took them up but was ready to drop on the ground when he beheld in large red characters these words inscribed by carathis which were indeed enough to make him tremble beware of thy old doctors and their puny messengers of but one cubit high distrust their pious frauds and instead of eating their melons impale on a spit the bearers of them shouldst thou be such a fool as to visit them the portal of the subterranean palace will be shut in thy face and with such force as shall shake thee asunder thy body shall be spit upon and bats will engender in thy belly to what tends this ominous rhapsody cries the caliph and must i then perish in these deserts with thirst whilst i may refresh myself in the valley of melons and cucumbers accursed be the giaour with his portal of ebony he hath made me dance attendance too long already besides who shall prescribe laws to me i forsooth must not enter any one s habitation be it so but what one can i enter that is not my own bababalouk who lost not a syllable of this soliloquy applauded it with all his heart and the ladies for the first time agreed with him in opinion the dwarfs were entertained caressed and seated with great ceremony on little cushions of satin the symmetry of their persons was the subject of criticism not an inch of them was suffered to pass unexamined knicknacks and dainties were offered in profusion but all were declined with respectful gravity they clambered up the sides of the caliph s seat and placing themselves each on one of his shoulders began to whisper prayers in his ears their tongues quivered like the leaves of a poplar and the patience of vathek was almost exhausted when the acclamations of the troops announced the approach of fakreddin who was come with a hundred old greyeards and as many korans and dromedaries they instantly set about their ablutions and began to repeat the bismillah vathek to get rid of these officious monitors followed their example for his hands were burning the good emir who was punctiliously religious and likewise a great dealer in compliments made an harangue five times more prolix and insipid than his harbingers had already delivered the caliph unable any longer to refrain exclaimed for the love of mahomet my dear fakreddin have done let us proceed to your valley and enjoy the fruits that heaven hath vouchsafed you the hint of proceeding put all into motion the venerable attendants of the emir set forward somewhat slowly but vathek having ordered his little pages in private to goad on the dromedaries loud fits of laughter broke forth from the cages for the unwieldy curvetting of these poor beasts and the ridiculous distress of their superannuated riders afforded the ladies no small entertainment they descended however unhurt into the valley by the large steps which the emir had cut in the rock and already the murmuring of streams and the rustling of leaves began to catch their attention the cavalcade soon entered a path which was skirted by flowering shrubs and extended to a vast wood of palmrees whose branches overspread a building of hewn stone this edifice was crowned with nine domes and adorned with as many portals of bronze on which was engraven the following inscription this is the asylum of pilgrims the refuge of travellers and the depository of secrets for all parts of the world nine pages beautiful as the day and clothed in robes of egyptian linen very long and very modest were standing at each door they received the whole retinue with an easy and inviting air four of the most amiable placed the caliph on a magnificent taktrevan four others somewhat less graceful took charge of bababalouk who capered for joy at the snug little cabin that fell to his share the pages that remained waited on the rest of the train when everything masculine was gone out of sight the gate of a large enclosure on the right turned on its harmonious hinges and a young female of a slender form came forth her light brown hair floated in the hazy breeze of the twilight a troop of young maidens like the pleiades attended her on tipoe they hastened to the pavilions that contained the sultanas and the young lady gracefully bending said to them charming princesses everything is ready we have prepared beds for your repose and strewed your apartments with jasmine no insects will keep off slumber from visiting your eyelids we will dispel them with a thousand plumes come then amiable ladies refresh your delicate feet and your ivory limbs in baths of rose water and by the light of perfumed lamps your servants will amuse you with tales the sultanas accepted with pleasure these obliging offers and followed the young lady to the emir s harem where we must for a moment leave them and return to the caliph vathek found himself beneath a vast dome illuminated by a thousand lamps of rock crystal as many vases of the same material filled with excellent sherbet sparkled on a large table where a profusion of viands were spread amongst others were sweetbreads stewed in milk of almonds saffron soups and lamb la cr me of all which the caliph was amazingly fond he took of each as much as he was able testified his sense of the emir s friendship by the gaiety of his heart and made the dwarfs dance against their will for these little devotees durst not refuse the commander of the faithful at last he spread himself on the sofa and slept sounder than he had ever before beneath this dome a general silence prevailed for there was nothing to disturb it but the jaws of bababalouk who had untrussed himself to eat with greater advantage being anxious to make amends for his fast in the mountains as his spirits were too high to admit of his sleeping and not loving to be idle he proposed with himself to visit the harem and repair to his charge of the ladies to examine if they had been properly lubricated with the balm of mecca if their eyebrows and tresses were in order and in a word to perform all the little offices they might need he sought for a long time together but without being able to find out the door he durst not speak aloud for fear of disturbing the caliph and not a soul was stirring in the precincts of the palace he almost despaired of effecting his purpose when a low whispering just reached his ear it came from the dwarfs who were returned to their old occupation and for the nine hundred and ninetyinth time in their lives were reading over the koran they very politely invited bababalouk to be of their party but his head was full of other concerns the dwarfs though scandalised at his dissolute morals directed him to the apartments he wanted to find his way thither lay through a hundred dark corridors along which he groped as he went and at last began to catch from the extremity of a passage the charming gossiping of the women which not a little delighted his heart ah ha what not yet asleep cried he and taking long strides as he spoke did you not suspect me of abjuring my charge i stayed but to finish what my master had left two of the black eunuchs on hearing a voice so loud detached a party in haste sabre in hand to discover the cause but presently was repeated on all sides tis only bababalouk no one but bababalouk this circumspect guardian having gone up to a thin veil of carnationoloured silk that hung before the doorway distinguished by means of the softened splendour that shone through it an oval bath of dark porphyry surrounded by curtains festooned in large folds through the apertures between them as they were not drawn close groups of young slaves were visible amongst whom bababalouk perceived his pupils indulgingly expanding their arms as if to embrace the perfumed water and refresh themselves after their fatigues the looks of tender languor their confidential whispers and the enchanting smiles with which they were imparted the exquisite fragrance of the roses all combined to inspire a voluptuousness which even bababalouk himself was scarce able to withstand he summoned up however his usual solemnity and in the peremptory tone of authority commanded the ladies instantly to leave the bath whilst he was issuing these mandates the young nouronihar daughter of the emir who was sprightly as an antelope and full of wanton gaiety beckoned one of her slaves to let down the great swing which was suspended to the ceiling by cords of silk and whilst this was doing winked to her companions in the bath who chagrined to be forced from so soothing a state of indolence began to twist it round bababalouk and tease him with a thousand vagaries when nouronihar perceived that he was exhausted with fatigue she accosted him with an arch air of respectful concern and said my lord it is not by any means decent that the chief eunuch of the caliph our sovereign should thus continue standing deign but to recline your graceful person upon this sofa which will burst with vexation if it have not the honour to receive you caught by these flattering accents bababalouk gallantly replied delight of the apple of my eye i accept the invitation of thy honeyed lips and to say truth my senses are dazzled with the radiance that beams from thy charms repose then at your ease replied the beauty and placed him on the pretended sofa which quicker than lightning gave way all at once the rest of the women having aptly conceived her design sprang naked from the bath and plied the swing with such unmerciful jerks that it swept through the whole compass of a very lofty dome and took from the poor victim all power of respiration sometimes his feet rased the surface of the water and at others the skylight almost flattened his nose in vain did he pierce the air with the cries of a voice that resembled the ringing of a cracked basin for their peals of laughter were still more predominant nouronihar in the inebriety of youthful spirits being used only to eunuchs of ordinary harems and having never seen anything so royal and disgusting was far more diverted than all of the rest she began to parody some persian verses and sang with an accent most demurely piquant o gentle white dove as thou soar st through the air vouchsafe one kind glance on the mate of thy love melodious philomel i am thy rose warble some couplet to ravish my heart the sultanas and their slaves stimulated by these pleasantries persevered at the swing with such unremitted assiduity that at length the cord which had secured it snapped suddenly asunder and bababalouk fell floundering like a turtle to the bottom of the bath this accident occasioned a universal shout twelve little doors till now unobserved flew open at once and the ladies in an instant made their escape after throwing all the towels on his head and putting out the lights that remained the deplorable animal in water to the chin overwhelmed with darkness and unable to extricate himself from the wrap that embarrassed him was still doomed to hear for his further consolation the fresh bursts of merriment his disaster occasioned he bustled but in vain to get from the bath for the margin was become so slippery with the oil spilt in breaking the lamps that at every effort he slid back with a plunge which resounded aloud through the hollow of the dome these cursed peals of laughter at every relapse were redoubled and he who thought the place infested rather by devils than women resolved to cease groping and abide in the bath where he amused himself with soliloquies interspersed with imprecations of which his malicious neighbours reclining on down suffered not an accent to escape in this delectable plight the morning surprised him the caliph wondering at his absence had caused him to be everywhere sought for at last he was drawn forth almost smothered from the wisp of linen and wet even to the marrow limping and chattering his teeth he appeared before his master who inquired what was the matter and how he came soused in so strange a pickle and why did you enter this cursed lodge answered bababalouk gruffly ought a monarch like you to visit with his harem the abode of a greyearded emir who knows nothing of life and with what gracious damsels doth the place too abound fancy to yourself how they have soaked me like a burnt crust and made me dance like a jackudding the liveong night through on their damnable swing what an excellent lesson for your sultanas to follow into whom i have instilled such reserve and decorum vathek comprehending not a syllable of all this invective obliged him to relate minutely the transaction but instead of sympathising with the miserable sufferer he laughed immoderately at the device of the swing and the figure of bababalouk mounting upon it the stung eunuch could scarcely preserve the semblance of respect ay laugh my lord laugh said he but i wish this nouronihar would play some trick on you she is too wicked to spare even majesty itself those words made for the present but a slight impression on the caliph but they not long after recurred to his mind this conversation was cut short by fakreddin who came to request that vathek would join in the prayers and ablutions to be solemnised on a spacious meadow watered by innumerable streams the caliph found the waters refreshing but the prayers abominably irksome he diverted himself however with the multitude of calenders santons and dervises who were continually coming and going but especially with the brahmins fakirs and other enthusiasts who had travelled from the heart of india and halted on their way with the emir these latter had each of them some mummery peculiar to himself one dragged a huge chain wherever he went another an ouranoutang whilst a third was furnished with scourges and all performed to a charm some clambered up trees holding one foot in the air others poised themselves over a fire and without mercy filliped their noses there were some amongst them that cherished vermin which were not ungrateful in requiting their caresses these rambling fanatics revolted the hearts of the dervises the calenders and santons however the vehemence of their aversion soon subsided under the hope that the presence of the caliph would cure their folly and convert them to the mussulman faith but alas how great was their disappointment for vathek instead of preaching to them treated them as buffoons bade them present his compliments to visnow and ixhora and discovered a predilection for a squat old man from the isle of serendib who was more ridiculous than any of the rest come said he for the love of your gods bestow a few slaps on your chops to amuse me the old fellow offended at such an address began loudly to weep but as he betrayed a villainous drivelling in his tears the caliph turned his back and listened to bababalouk who whispered whilst he held the umbrella over him your majesty should be cautious of this odd assembly which hath been collected i know not for what is it necessary to exhibit such spectacles to a mighty potentate with interludes of talapoins more mangy than dogs were i you i would command a fire to be kindled and at once purge the earth of the emir his harem and all his menagerie tush dolt answered vathek and know that all this infinitely charms me nor shall i leave the meadow till i have visited every hive of these pious mendicants wherever the caliph directed his course objects of pity were sure to swarm round him the blind the purblind smarts without noses damsels without ears each to extol the munificence of fakreddin who as well as his attendant greyeards dealt about gratis plasters and cataplasms to all that applied at noon a superb corps of cripples made its appearance and soon after advanced by platoons on the plain the completest association of invalids that had ever been embodied till then the blind went groping with the blind the lame limped on together and the maimed made gestures to each other with the only arm that remained the sides of a considerable waterfall were crowded by the deaf amongst whom were some from peg with ears uncommonly handsome and large but were still less able to hear than the rest nor were there wanting others in abundance with humpbacks wenny necks and even horns of an exquisite polish the emir to aggrandise the solemnity of the festival in honour of his illustrious visitant ordered the turf to be spread on all sides with skins and tableloths upon which were served up for the good mussulmans pilaus of every line with other orthodox dishes and by the express order of vathek who was shamefully tolerant small plates of abominations for regaling the rest this prince on seeing so many mouths put in motion began to think it time for employing his own in spite therefore of every remonstrance from the chief of his eunuchs he resolved to have a dinner dressed on the spot the complaisant emir immediately gave orders for a table to be placed in the shade of the willows the first service consisted of fish which they drew from a river flowing over sands of gold at the foot of a lofty hill these were broiled as fast as taken and served up with a sauce of vinegar and small herbs that grow on mount sinai for everything with the emir was excellent and pious the dessert was not quite set on when the sound of lutes from the hill was repeated by the echoes of the neighbouring mountains the caliph with an emotion of pleasure and surprise had no sooner raised up his head than a handful of jasmine dropped on his face an abundance of tittering succeeded the frolic and instantly appeared through the bushes the elegant forms of several young females skipping and bounding like roes the fragrance diffused from their hair struck the sense of vathek who in an ecstasy suspending his repast said to bababalouk are the peris come down from their spheres note her in particular whose form is so perfect venturously running on the brink of the precipice and turning back her head as regardless of nothing but the graceful flow of her robe with what captivating impatience doth she contend with the bushes for her veil could it be she who threw the jasmine at me ay she it was and you too would she throw from the top of the rock answered bababalouk for that is my good friend nouronihar who so kindly lent me her swing my dear lord and master added he twisting a twig that hung by the rind from a willow let me correct her for want of respect the emir will have no reason to complain since bating what i owe to his piet he is much to be censured for keeping a troop of girls on the mountains whose sharp air gives their blood too brisk a circulation peace blasphemer said the caliph speak not thus of her who over her mountains leads my heart a willing captive contrive rather that my eyes may be fixed upon hers that i may respire her sweet breath as she bounds panting along these delightful wilds on saying these words vathek extended his arms towards the hill and directing his eyes with an anxiety unknown to him before endeavoured to keep within view the object that enthralled his soul but her course was as difficult to follow as the flight of one of those beautiful blue butterflies of cashmere which are at once so volatile and rare the caliph not satisfied with seeing wished also to hear nouronihar and eagerly turned to catch the sound of her voice at last he distinguished her whispering to one of her companions behind the thicket from whence she had thrown the jasmine a caliph it must be owned is a fine thing to see but my little gulchenrouz is much more amiable one lock of his hair is of more value to me than the richest embroidery of the indies i had rather that his teeth should mischievously press my finger than the richest ring of the imperial treasure where have you left him sutlememe and why is he now not here the agitated caliph still wished to hear more but she immediately retired with all her attendants the fond monarch pursued her with his eyes till she was gone out of sight and then continued like a bewildered and benighted traveller from whom the clouds had obscured the constellation that guided his way the curtain of night seemed dropped before him everything appeared discoloured the falling waters filled his soul with dejection and his tears trickled down the jasmines he had caught from nouronihar and placed in his inflamed bosom he snatched up a shining pebble to remind him of the scene where he felt the first tumults of love two hours were elapsed and evening drew on before he could resolve to depart from the place he often but in vain attempted to go a soft languor enervated the powers of his mind extending himself on the brink of the stream he turned his eyes towards the blue summits of the mountain and exclaimed what concealest thou behind thee what is passing in thy solitudes whither is she gone o heaven perhaps she is now wandering in thy grottos with her happy gulchenrouz in the meantime the damps began to descend and the emir solicitous for the health of the caliph ordered the imperial litter to be brought vathek absorbed in his reveries was imperceptibly removed and conveyed back to the saloon that received him the evening before but let us leave the caliph immersed in his new passion and attend nouronihar beyond the rocks where she had again joined her beloved gulchenrouz this gulchenrouz was the son of ali hassan brother to the emir and the most delicate and lovely creature in the world ali hassan who had been absent ten years on a voyage to the unknown seas committed at his departure this child the only survivor of many to the care and protection of his brother gulchenrouz could write in various characters with precision and paint upon vellum the most elegant arabesques that fancy could devise his sweet voice accompanied the lute in the most enchanting manner and when he sang the loves of megnoun and leileh or some unfortunate lovers of ancient days tears insensibly overflowed the cheeks of his auditors the verses he composed for like megnoun he too was a poe inspired that unresisting languor so frequently fatal to the female heart the women all doted upon him for though he had passed his thirteenth year they still detained him in the harem his dancing was light as the gossamer waved by the zephyrs of spring but his arms which twined so gracefully with those of the young girls in the dance could neither dart the lance in the chase nor curb the steeds that pastured his uncle s domains the bow however he drew with a certain aim and would have excelled his competitors in the race could he have broken the ties that bound him to nouronihar the two brothers had mutually engaged their children to each other and nouronihar loved her cousin more than her eyes both had the same tastes and amusements the same long languishing looks the same tresses the same fair complexions and when gulchenrouz appeared in the dress of his cousin he seemed to be more feminine than even herself if at any time he left the harem to visit fakreddin it was with all the bashfulness of a fawn that consciously ventures from the lair of its dam he was however wanton enough to mock the solemn old greyeards to whom he was subject though sure to be rated without mercy in return whenever this happened he would plunge into the recesses of the harem and sobbing take refuge in the arms of nouronihar who loved even his faults beyond the virtues of others it fell out this evening that after leaving the caliph in the meadow she ran with gulchenrouz over the green sward of the mountain that sheltered the vale where fakreddin had chosen to reside the sun was dilated on the edge of the horizon and the young people whose fancies were lively and inventive imagined they beheld in the gorgeous clouds of the west the domes of shadukiam and amberabad where the peris have fixed their abode nouronihar sitting on the slope of the hill supported on her knees the perfumed head of gulchenrouz the air was calm and no sound stirred but the voices of other young girls who were drawing cool water from the streams below the unexpected arrival of the caliph and the splendour that marked his appearance had already filled with emotion the ardent soul of nouronihar her vanity irresistibly prompted her to pique the prince s attention and this she before took good care to effect whilst he picked up the jasmine she had thrown upon him but when gulchenrouz asked after the flowers he had culled for her bosom nouronihar was all in confusion she hastily kissed his forehead arose in a flutter and walked with unequal steps on the border of the precipice night advanced and the pure gold of the setting sun had yielded to a sanguine red the glow of which like the reflection of a burning furnace flushed nouronihar s animated countenance gulchenrouz alarmed at the agitation of his cousin said to her with a supplicating accent let us be gone the sky looks portentous the tamarisks tremble more than common and the raw wind chills my very heart come let us be gone tis a melancholy night then taking hold of her hand he drew it towards the path he besought her to go nouronihar unconsciously followed the attraction for a thousand strange imaginations occupied her spirit she passed the large round of honeysuckles her favourite resort without ever vouchsafing it a glance yet gulchenrouz could not help snatching off a few shoots in his way though he ran as if a wild beast were behind the young females seeing him approach in such haste and according to custom expecting a dance instantly assembled in a circle and took each other by the hand but gulchenrouz coming up out of breath fell down at once on the grass this accident struck with consternation the whole of this frolicsome party whilst nouronihar half distracted and overcome both by the violence of her exercise and the tumult of her thoughts sunk feebly down at his side cherished his cold hands in her bosom and chafed his temples with a fragrant unguent at length he came to himself and wrapping up his head in the robe of his cousin entreated that she would not return to the harem he was afraid of being snapped at by shaban his tutor a wrinkled old eunuch of a surly disposition for having interrupted the stated walk of nouronihar he dreaded lest the churl should take it amiss the whole of this sprightly group sitting round upon a mossy knoll began to entertain themselves with various pastimes whilst their superintendents the eunuchs were gravely conversing at a distance the nurse of the emir s daughter observing her pupil sit ruminating with her eyes on the ground endeavoured to amuse her with diverting tales to which gulchenrouz who had already forgotten his inquietudes listened with a breathless attention he laughed he clapped his hands and passed a hundred little tricks on the whole of the company without omitting the eunuchs whom he provoked to run after him in spite of their age and decrepitude during these occurrences the moon arose the wind subsided and the evening became so serene and inviting that a resolution was taken to sup on the spot sutlememe who excelled in dressing a salad having filled large bowls of porcelain with eggs of small birds curds turned with citron juice slices of cucumber and the inmost leaves of delicate herbs handed it round from one to another and gave each their shares in a large spoon of cocknos gulchenrouz nestling as usual in the bosom of nouronihar pouted out his vermilion little lips against the offer of sutlememe and would take it only from the hand of his cousin on whose mouth he hung like a bee inebriated with the quintessence of flowers one of the eunuchs ran to fetch melons whilst others were employed in showering down almonds from the branches that overhung this amiable party in the midst of this festive scene there appeared a light on the top of the highest mountain which attracted the notice of every eye this light was not less bright than the moon when at full and might have been taken for her had it not been that the moon was already risen the phenomenon occasioned a general surprise and no one could conjecture the cause it could not be a fire for the light was clear and bluish nor had meteors ever been seen of that magnitude or splendour this strange light faded for a moment and immediately renewed its brightness it first appeared motionless at the foot of the rock whence it darted in an instant to sparkle in a thicket of palmrees from thence it glided along the torrent and at last fixed in a glen that was narrow and dark the moment it had taken its direction gulchenrouz whose heart always trembled at anything sudden or rare drew nouronihar by the robe and anxiously requested her to return to the harem the women were importunate in seconding the entreaty but the curiosity of the emir s daughter prevailed she not only refused to go back but resolved at all hazards to pursue the appearance whilst they were debating what was best to be done the light shot forth so dazzling a blaze that they all fled away shrieking nouronihar followed them a few steps but coming to the turn of a little byeath stopped and went back alone as she ran with an alertness peculiar to herself it was not long before she came to the place where they had just been supping the globe of fire now appeared stationary in the glen and burned in majestic stillness nouronihar compressing her hands upon her bosom hesitated for some moments to advance the solitude of her situation was new the silence of the night awful and every object inspired sensations which till then she never had felt the affright of gulchenrouz recurred to her mind and she a thousand times turned to go back but this luminous appearance was always before her urged on by an irresistible impulse she continued to approach it in defiance of every obstacle that opposed her progress at length she arrived at the opening of the glen but instead of coming up to the light she found herself surrounded by darkness excepting that at a considerable distance a faint spark glimmered by fits she stopped a second time the sound of wateralls mingling their murmurs the hollow rustlings amongst the palmranches and the funereal screams of the birds from their rifted trunks all conspired to fill her with terror she imagined every moment that she trod on some venomous reptile all the stories of malignant dives and dismal gouls thronged into her memory but her curiosity was notwithstanding more predominant than her fears she therefore firmly entered a winding track that led towards the spark but being a stranger to the path she had not gone far till she began to repent of her rashness alas said she that i were but in those secure and illuminated apartments where my evenings glided on with gulchenrouz dear child how would thy heart flutter with terror wert thou wandering in these wild solitudes like me at the close of this apostrophe she regained her road and coming to steps hewn out in the rock ascended them undismayed the light which was now gradually enlarging appeared above her on the summit of the mountain at length she distinguished a plaintive and melodious union of voices proceeding from a sort of cavern that resembled the dirges which are sung over tombs a sound likewise like that which arises from the filling of baths at the same time struck her ear she continued ascending and discovered large wax torches in full blaze planted here and there in the fissures of the rock this preparation filled her with fear whilst the subtle and potent odour which the torches exhaled caused her to sink almost lifeless at the entrance of the grot casting her eyes within in this kind of trance she beheld a large cistern of gold filled with a water whose vapour distilled on her face a dew of the essence of roses a soft symphony resounded through the grot on the sides of the cistern she noticed appendages of royalty diadems and feathers of the heron all sparkling with carbuncles whilst her attention was fixed on this display of magnificence the music ceased and a voice instantly demanded for what monarch were these torches kindled this bath prepared and these habiliments which belong not only to the sovereigns of the earth but even to the talismanic powers to which a second voice answered they are for the charming daughter of the emir fakreddin what replied the first for that trifler who consumes her time with a giddy child immersed in softness and who at best can make but an enervated husband and can she rejoined the other voice be amused with such empty trifles whilst the caliph the sovereign of the world he who is destined to enjoy the treasures of the predamite sultans a prince six feet high and whose eyes pervade the inmost soul of a female is inflamed with the love of her no she will be wise enough to answer that passion alone that can aggrandise her glory no doubt she will and despise the puppet of her fancy then all the riches this place contains as well as the carbuncle of giamschid shall be hers you judge right returned the first voice and i haste to istakar to prepare the palace of subterranean fire for the reception of the bridal pair the voices ceased the torches were extinguished the most entire darkness succeeded and nouronihar recovering with a start found herself reclined on a sofa in the harem of her father she clapped her hands and immediately came together gulchenrouz and her women who in despair at having lost her had despatched eunuchs to seek her in every direction shaban appeared with the rest and began to reprimand her with an air of consequence little impertinent said he whence got you false keys or are you beloved of some genius that hath given you a pickock i will try the extent of your power come to your chamber through the two skylights and expect not the company of gulchenrouz be expeditious i will shut you up in the double tower at these menaces nouronihar indignantly raised her head opened on shaban her black eyes which since the important dialogue of the enchanted grot were considerably enlarged and said go speak thus to slaves but learn to reverence her who is born to give laws and subject all to her power she was proceeding in the same style but was interrupted by a sudden exclamation of the caliph the caliph the curtains at once were thrown open and the slaves prostrate in double rows whilst poor little gulchenrouz hid himself beneath the elevation of a sofa at first appeared a file of black eunuchs trailing after them long trains of muslin embroidered with gold and holding in their hands censers which dispensed as they passed the grateful perfume of the wood of aloes next marched bababalouk with a solemn strut and tossing his head as not overleased at the visit vathek came close after superbly robed his gait was unembarrassed and noble and his presence would have engaged admiration though he had not been the sovereign of the world he approached nouronihar with a throbbing heart and seemed enraptured at the full effulgence of her radiant eyes of which he had before caught but a few glimpses but she instantly depressed them and her confusion augmented her beauty bababalouk who was a thorough adept in coincidences of this nature and knew that the worst game should be played with the best face immediately made a signal for all to retire and no sooner did he perceive beneath the sofa the little one s feet than he drew him forth without ceremony set him upon his shoulders and lavished on him as he went off a thousand odious caresses gulchenrouz cried out and resisted till his cheeks became the colour of the blossom of the pomegranate and the tears that started into his eyes shot forth a gleam of indignation he cast a significant glance at nouronihar which the caliph noticing asked is that then your gulchenrouz sovereign of the world answered she spare my cousin whose innocence and gentleness deserve not your anger take comfort said vathek with a smile he is in good hands bababalouk is fond of children and never goes without sweetmeats and comfits the daughter of fakreddin was abashed and suffered gulchenrouz to be borne away without adding a word the tumult of her bosom betrayed her confusion and vathek becoming still more impassioned gave a loose to his frenzy which had only not subdued the last faint strugglings of reluctance when the emir suddenly bursting in threw his face upon the ground at the feet of the caliph and said commander of the faithful abase not yourself to the meanness of your slave no emir replied vathek i raise her to an equality with myself i declare her my wife and the glory of your race shall extend from one generation to another alas my lord said fakreddin as he plucked off the honours of his beard cut short the days of your faithful servant rather than force him to depart from his word nouronihar as her hands evince is solemnly promised to gulchenrouz the son of my brother ali hassan they are united also in heart their faith is mutually plighted and affiances so sacred cannot be broken what then replied the caliph bluntly would you surrender this divine beauty to a husband more womanish than herself and can you imagine that i will suffer her charms to decay in hands so inefficient and nerveless no she is destined to live out her life within my embraces such is my will retire and disturb not the time i devote to the homage of her charms the irritated emir drew forth his sabre presented it to vathek and stretching out his neck said in a firm tone of voice strike your unhappy host my lord he has lived long enough since he hath seen the prophet s vicegerent violate the rites of hospitality at his uttering these words nouronihar unable to support any longer the conflict of her passions sank down in a swoon vathek both terrified for her life and furious at an opposition to his will bade fakreddin assist his daughter and withdrew darting his terrible look at the unfortunate emir who suddenly fell backward bathed in a sweat cold as the damp of death gulchenrouz who had escaped from the hands of bababalouk and was that instant returned called out for help as loudly as he could not having strength to afford it himself pale and panting the poor child attempted to revive nouronihar by caresses and it happened that the thrilling warmth of his lips restored her to life fakreddin beginning also to recover from the look of the caliph with difficulty tottered to a seat and after warily casting round his eye to see if this dangerous prince was gone sent for shaban and sutlememe and said to them apart my friends violent evils require as violent remedies the caliph has brought desolation and horror into my family and how shall we resist his power another of his looks will send me to my grave fetch then that narcotic powder which the dervish brought me from aracan a dose of it the effect of which will continue three days must be administered to each of these children the caliph will believe them to be dead for they will have all the appearance of death we shall go as if to inter them in the cave of meimoune at the entrance of the great desert of sand and near the cabin of my dwarfs when all the spectators shall be withdrawn you shaban and four select eunuchs shall convey them to the lake where provisions shall be ready to support them a month for one day allotted to the surprise this event will occasion five to the tears a fortnight to reflection and the rest to prepare for renewing his progress will according to my calculation fill up the whole time that vathek will tarry and i shall then be freed from his intrusion your plan said sutlememe is a good one if it can but be effected i have remarked that nouronihar is well able to support the glances of the caliph and that he is far from being sparing of them to her be assured therefore notwithstanding her fondness for gulchenrouz she will never remain quiet while she knows him to be here unless we can persuade her that both herself and gulchenrouz are really dead and that they were conveyed to those rocks for a limited season to expiate the little faults of which their love was the cause we will add that we killed ourselves in despair and that your dwarfs whom they never yet saw will preach to them delectable sermons i will engage that everything shall succeed to the bent of your wishes be it so said fakreddin i approve your proposal let us lose not a moment to give it effect they forthwith hastened to seek for the powder which being mixed in a sherbet was immediately drank by gulchenrouz and nouronihar within the space of an hour both were seized with violent palpitations and a general numbness gradually ensued they arose from the floor where they had remained ever since the caliph s departure and ascending to the sofa reclined themselves at full length upon it clasped in each other s embraces cherish me my dear nouronihar said gulchenrouz put thy hand upon my heart for it feels as if it were frozen alas thou art as cold as myself hath the caliph murdered us both with his terrible look i am dying cried she in a faltering voice press me closer i am ready to expire let us die then together answered the little gulchenrouz whilst his breast laboured with a convulsive sigh let me at least breathe forth my soul on thy lips they spoke no more and became as dead immediately the most piercing cries were heard through the harem whilst shaban and sutlememe personated with great adroitness the parts of persons in despair the emir who was sufficiently mortified to be forced into such untoward expedients and had now for the first time made a trial of his powder was under no necessity of counterfeiting grief the slaves who had flocked together from all quarters stood motionless at the spectacle before them all lights were extinguished save two lamps which shed a wan glimmering over the faces of these lovely flowers that seemed to be faded in the springime of life funeral vestments were prepared their bodies were washed with roseater their beautiful tresses were braided and incensed and they were wrapped in simars whiter than alabaster at the moment that their attendants were placing two wreaths of their favourite jasmines on their brows the caliph who had just heard of the tragical catastrophe arrived he looked not less pale and haggard than the gouls that wander at night among graves forgetful of himself and every one else he broke through the midst of the slaves fell prostrate at the foot of the sofa beat his bosom called himself atrocious murderer and invoked upon his head a thousand imprecations with a trembling hand he raised the veil that covered the countenance of nouronihar and uttering a loud shriek fell lifeless on the floor the chief of the eunuchs dragged him off with horrible grimaces and repeated as he went ay i foresaw she would play you some ungracious turn no sooner was the caliph gone than the emir commanded biers to be brought and forbad that any one should enter the harem every window was fastened all instruments of music were broken and the imams began to recite their prayers towards the close of this melancholy day vathek sobbed in silence for they had been forced to compose with anodynes his convulsions of rage and desperation at the dawn of the succeeding morning the wide folding doors of the palace were set open and the funeral procession moved forward for the mountain the wailful cries of la ilah illa allah reached to the caliph who was eager to cicatrise himself and attend the ceremonial nor could he have been dissuaded had not his excessive weakness disabled him from walking at the few first steps he fell on the ground and his people were obliged to lay him on a bed where he remained many days in such a state of insensibility as excited compassion in the emir himself when the procession was arrived at the grot of meimoune shaban and sutlememe dismissed the whole of the train excepting the four confidential eunuchs who were appointed to remain after resting some moments near the biers which had been left in the open air they caused them to be carried to the brink of a small lake whose banks were overgrown with a hoary moss this was the great resort of herons and storks which preyed continually on little blue fishes the dwarfs instructed by the emir soon repaired thither and with the help of the eunuchs began to construct cabins of rushes and reeds a work in which they had admirable skill a magazine also was contrived for provisions with a small oratory for themselves and a pyramid of wood neatly piled to furnish the necessary fuel for the air was bleak in the hollows of the mountains at evening two fires were kindled on the brink of the lake and the two lovely bodies taken from their biers were carefully deposited upon a bed of dried leaves within the same cabin the dwarfs began to recite the koran with their clear shrill voices and shaban and sutlememe stood at some distance anxiously waiting the effects of the powder at length nouronihar and gulchenrouz faintly stretched out their arms and gradually opening their eyes began to survey with looks of increasing amazement every object around them they even attempted to rise but for want of strength fell back again sutlememe on this administered a cordial which the emir had taken care to provide gulchenrouz thoroughly aroused sneezed out aloud and raising himself with an effort that expressed his surprise left the cabin and inhaled the fresh air with the greatest avidity yes said he i breathe again again do i exist i hear sounds i behold a firmament spangled over with stars nouronihar catching these beloved accents extricated herself from the leaves and ran to clasp gulchenrouz to her bosom the first objects she remarked were their long simars their garlands of flowers and their naked feet she hid her face in her hands to reflect the vision of the enchanted bath the despair of her father and more vividly than both the majestic figure of vathek recurred to her memory she recollected also that herself and gulchenrouz had been sick and dying but all these images bewildered her mind not knowing where she was she turned her eyes on all sides as if to recognise the surrounding scene this singular lake those flames reflected from its glassy surface the pale hues of its banks the romantic cabins the bulrushes that sadly waved their drooping heads the storks whose melancholy cries blended with the shrill voices of the dwarfs everything conspired to persuade them that the angel of death had opened the portal of some other world gulchenrouz on his part lost in wonder clung to the neck of his cousin he believed himself in the region of phantoms and was terrified at the silence she preserved at length addressing her speak said he where are we do you not see those spectres that are stirring the burning coals are they monker and nakir come to throw us into them does the fatal bridge cross this lake whose solemn stillness perhaps conceals from us an abyss in which for whole ages we shall be doomed incessantly to sink no my children said sutlememe going towards them take comfort the exterminating angel who conducted our souls hither after yours hath assured us that the chastisement of your indolent and voluptuous life shall be restricted to a certain series of years which you must pass in this dreary abode where the sun is scarcely visible and where the soil yields neither fruits nor flowers these continued she pointing to the dwarfs will provide for our wants for souls so mundane as ours retain too strong a tincture of their earthly extraction instead of meats your food will be nothing but rice and your bread shall be moistened in the fogs that brood over the surface of the lake at this desolating prospect the poor children burst into tears and prostrated themselves before the dwarfs who perfectly supported their characters and delivered an excellent discourse of a customary length upon the sacred camel which after a thousand years was to convey them to the paradise of the faithful the sermon being ended and ablutions performed they praised allah and the prophet supped very indifferently and retired to their withered leaves nouronihar and her little cousin consoled themselves on finding that though dead they yet lay in one cabin having slept well before the remainder of the night was spent in conversation on what had befallen them and both from a dread of apparitions betook themselves for protection to one another s arms in the morning which was lowering and rainy the dwarfs mounted high poles like minarets and called them to prayers the whole congregation which consisted of sutlememe shaban the four eunuchs and some storks were already assembled the two children came forth from their cabin with a slow and dejected pace as their minds were in a tender and melancholy mood their devotions were performed with fervour no sooner were they finished than gulchenrouz demanded of sutlememe and the rest how they happened to die so opportunely for his cousin and himself we killed ourselves returned sutlememe in despair at your death on this said nouronihar who notwithstanding what was past had not yet forgotten her vision and the caliph is he also dead of his grief and will he likewise come hither the dwarfs who were prepared with an answer most demurely replied vathek is damned beyond all redemption i readily believe so said gulchenrouz and i am glad from my heart to hear it for i am convinced it was his horrible look that sent us hither to listen to sermons and mess upon rice one week passed away on the side of the lake unmarked by any variety nouronihar ruminating on the grandeur of which death had deprived her and gulchenrouz applying to prayers and to panniers along with the dwarfs who infinitely pleased him whilst this scene of innocence was exhibiting in the mountains the caliph presented himself to the emir in a new light the instant he recovered the use of his senses with a voice that made bababalouk quake he thundered out perfidious giaour i renounce thee for ever it is thou who hast slain my beloved nouronihar and i supplicate the pardon of mahomet who would have preserved her to me had i been more wise let water be brought to perform my ablutions and let the pious fakreddin be called to offer up his prayers with mine and reconcile me to him afterwards we will go together and visit the sepulchre of the unfortunate nouronihar i am resolved to become a hermit and consume the residue of my days on this mountain in hope of expiating my crimes nouronihar was not altogether so content for though she felt a fondness for gulchenrouz who to augment the attachment had been left at full liberty with her yet she still regarded him as but a bauble that bore no competition with the carbuncle of giamschid at times she indulged doubts on the mode of her being and scarcely could believe that the dead had all the wants and the whims of the living to gain satisfaction however on so perplexing a topic she arose one morning whilst all were asleep with a breathless caution from the side of gulchenrouz and after having given him a soft kiss began to follow the windings of the lake till it terminated with a rock whose top was accessible though lofty this she clambered up with considerable toil and having reached the summit set forward in a run like a doe that unwittingly follows her hunter though she skipped along with the alertness of an antelope yet at intervals she was forced to desist and rest beneath the tamarisks to recover her breath whilst she thus reclined was occupied with her little reflections on the apprehension that she had some knowledge of the place vathek who finding himself that morning but ill at ease had gone forth before the dawn presented himself on a sudden to her view motionless with surprise he durst not approach the figure before him which lay shrouded up in a simar extended on the ground trembling and pale but yet lovely to behold at length nouronihar with a mixture of pleasure and affliction raising her fine eyes to him said my lord are you come hither to eat rice and hear sermons with me beloved phantom cried vathek dost thou speak hast thou the same graceful form the same radiant features art thou palpable likewise and eagerly embracing her added here are limbs and a bosom animated with a gentle warmth what can such a prodigy mean nouronihar with diffidence answered you know my lord that i died on the night you honoured me with your visit my cousin maintains it was from one of your glances but i cannot believe him for to me they seem not so dreadful gulchenrouz died with me and we were both brought into a region of desolation where we are fed with a wretched diet if you be dead also and are come hither to join us i pity your lot for you will be stunned with the noise of the dwarfs and the storks besides it is mortifying in the extreme that you as well as myself should have lost the treasures of the subterranean palace at the mention of the subterranean palace the caliph suspended his caresses to seek from nouronihar an explanation of her meaning she then recapitulated her vision what immediately followed and the history of her pretended death adding also a description of the place of expiation from whence she had fled and all in a manner that would have extorted his laughter had not the thoughts of vathek been too deeply engaged no sooner however had she ended than he again clasped her to his bosom and said light of my eyes the mystery is unravelled we both are alive your father is a cheat who for the sake of dividing hath deluded us both and the giaour whose design as far as i can discover is that we shall proceed together seems scarce a whit better it shall be some time at least before he find us in his palace of fire your lovely little person in my estimation is far more precious than all the treasures of the predamite sultans and i wish to possess it at pleasure and in open day for many a moon before i go to burrow underground like a mole forget this little trifler gulchenrouz and ah my lord interposed nouronihar let me entreat that you do him no evil no no replied vathek i have already bid you forbear to alarm yourself for him he has been brought up too much on milk and sugar to stimulate my jealousy we will leave him with the dwarfs who by the bye are my old acquaintances their company will suit him far better than yours as to other matters i will return no more to your father s i want not to have my ears dinned by him and his dotards with the violation of the rites of hospitality as if it were less an honour for you to espouse the sovereign of the world than a girl dressed up like a boy nouronihar could find nothing to oppose in a discourse so eloquent she only wished the amorous monarch had discovered more ardour for the carbuncle of giamschid but flattered herself it would gradually increase and therefore yielded to his will with the most bewitching submission when the caliph judged it proper he called for bababalouk who was asleep in the cave of meimoune and dreaming that the phantom of nouronihar having mounted him once more on her swing had just given him such a jerk that he one moment soared above the mountains and the next sunk into the abyss starting from his sleep at the voice of his master he ran gasping for breath and had nearly fallen backward at the sight as he believed of the spectre by whom he had so lately been haunted in his dream ah my lord cried he recoiling ten steps and covering his eyes with both hands do you then perform the office of a goul tis true you have dug up the dead yet hope not to make her your prey for after all she hath caused me to suffer she is even wicked enough to prey upon you cease thy folly said vathek and thou shalt soon be convinced that it is nouronihar herself alive and well whom i clasp to my breast go only and pitch my tents in the neighbouring valley there will i fix my abode with this beautiful tulip whose colours i soon shall restore there exert thy best endeavours to procure whatever can augment the enjoyments of life till i shall disclose to thee more of my will the news of so unlucky an event soon reached the ears of the emir who abandoned himself to grief and despair and began as did all his old greyeards to begrime his visage with ashes a total supineness ensued travellers were no longer entertained no more plaisters were spread and instead of the charitable activity that had distinguished this asylum the whole of its inhabitants exhibited only faces of a half cubit long and uttered groans that accorded with their forlorn situation though fakreddin bewailed his daughter as lost to him for ever yet gulchenrouz was not forgotten he despatched immediate instruction to sutlememe shaban and the dwarfs enjoining them not to undeceive the child in respect to his state but under some pretence to convey him far from the lofty rock at the extremity of the lake to a place which he should appoint as safer from danger for he suspected that vathek intended him evil gulchenrouz in the meanwhile was filled with amazement at not finding his cousin nor were the dwarfs at all less surprised but sutlememe who had more penetration immediately guessed what had happened gulchenrouz was amused with the delusive hope of once more embracing nouronihar in the interior recesses of the mountains where the ground strewed over with orange blossoms and jasmines offered beds much more inviting than the withered leaves in their cabin where they might accompany with their voices the sounds of their lutes and chase butterflies in concert sutlememe was far gone in this sort of description when one of the four eunuchs beckoned her aside to apprise her of the arrival of a messenger from their fraternity who had explained the secret of the flight of nouronihar and brought the commands of the emir a council with shaban and the dwarfs was immediately held their baggage being stowed in consequence of it they embarked in a shallop and quietly sailed with the little one who acquiesced in all their proposals their voyage proceeded in the same manner till they came to the place where the lake sinks beneath the hollow of the rock but as soon as the bark had entered it and gulchenrouz found himself surrounded with darkness he was seized with a dreadful consternation and incessantly uttered the most piercing outcries for he now was persuaded he should actually be damned for having taken too much freedom in his lifeime with his cousin but let us return to the caliph and her who ruled over his heart bababalouk had pitched the tents and closed up the extremities of the valley with magnificent screens of india cloth which were guarded by ethiopian slaves with their drawn sabres to preserve the verdure of this beautiful enclosure in its natural freshness the white eunuchs went continually round it with their red wateressels the waving of fans was heard near the imperial pavilion where by the voluptuous light that glowed through the muslins the caliph enjoyed at full view all the attractions of nouronihar inebriated with delight he was all ear to her charming voice which accompanied the lute while she was not less captivated with his descriptions of samarah and the tower full of wonders but especially with his relation of the adventure of the ball and the chasm of the giaour with its ebony portal in this manner they conversed for a day and a night they bathed together in a basin of black marble which admirably relieved the fairness of nouronihar bababalouk whose good graces this beauty had regained spared no attention that their repasts might be served up with the minutest exactness some exquisite rarity was ever placed before them and he sent even to schiraz for that fragrant and delicious wine which had been hoarded up in bottles prior to the birth of mahomet he had excavated little ovens in the rock to bake the nice manchets which were prepared by the hands of nouronihar from whence they had derived a flavour so grateful to vathek that he regarded the ragouts of his other wives as entirely mawkish whilst they would have died at the emir s of chagrin at finding themselves so neglected if fakreddin notwithstanding his resentment had not taken pity upon them the sultana dilara who till then had been the favourite took this dereliction of the caliph to heart with a vehemence natural to her character for during her continuance in favour she had imbibed from vathek many of his extravagant fancies and was fired with impatience to behold the superb tombs of istakar and the palace of forty columns besides having been brought up amongst the magi she had fondly cherished the idea of the caliph s devoting himself to the worship of fire thus his voluptuous and desultory life with her rival was to her a double source of affliction the transient piety of vathek had occasioned her some serious alarms but the present was an evil of far greater magnitude she resolved therefore without hesitation to write to carathis and acquaint her that all things went ill that they had eaten slept and revelled at an old emir s whose sanctity was very formidable and that after all the prospect of possessing the treasures of the predamite sultans was no less remote than before this letter was entrusted to the care of two wooden who were at work on one of the great forests of the mountains and being acquainted with the shortest cuts arrived in ten days at samarah the princess carathis was engaged at chess with morakanabad when the arrival of these woodellers was announced she after some weeks of vathek s absence had forsaken the upper regions of her tower because everything appeared in confusion among the stars whom she consulted relative to the fate of her son in vain did she renew her fumigations and extend herself on the roof to obtain mystic visions nothing more could she see in her dreams than pieces of brocade nosegays of flowers and other unmeaning gewgaws these disappointments had thrown her into a state of dejection which no drug in her power was sufficient to remove her only resource was in morakanabad who was a good man and endowed with a decent share of confidence yet whilst in her company he never thought himself on roses no person knew aught of vathek and a thousand ridiculous stories were propagated at his expense the eagerness of carathis may be easily guessed at receiving the letter as well as her rage at reading the dissolute conduct of her son is it so said she either i will perish or vathek shall enter the palace of fire let me expire in flames provided he may reign on the throne of soliman having said this and whirled herself round in a magical manner which struck morakanabad with such terror as caused him to recoil she ordered her great camel alboufaki to be brought and the hideous nerkes with the unrelenting cafour to attend i require no other retinue said she to morakanabad i am going on affairs of emergency a truce therefore to parade take you care of the people fleece them well in my absence for we shall expend large sums and one knows not what may betide the night was uncommonly dark and a pestilential blast ravaged the plain of catoul that would have deterred any other traveller however urgent the call but carathis enjoyed most whatever filled others with dread nerkes concurred in opinion with her and cafour had a particular predilection for a pestilence in the morning this accomplished caravan with the woodellers who directed their route halted on the edge of an extensive marsh from whence so noxious a vapour arose as would have destroyed any animal but alboufaki who naturally inhaled these malignant fogs the peasants entreated their convoy not to sleep in this place to sleep cried carathis what an excellent thought i never sleep but for visions and as to my attendants their occupations are too many to close the only eye they each have the poor peasants who were not overleased with their party remained openouthed with surprise carathis alighted as well as her negresses and severally stripping off their outer garments they all ran in their drawers to cull from those spots where the sun shone fiercest the venomous plants that grew on the marsh this provision was made for the family of the emir and whoever might retard the expedition to istakar the wooden were overcome with fear when they beheld these three horrible phantoms run and not much relishing the company of alboufaki stood aghast at the command of carathis to set forward notwithstanding it was noon and the heat fierce enough to calcine even rocks in spite however of every remonstrance they were forced implicitly to submit alboufaki who delighted in solitude constantly snorted whenever he perceived himself near a habitation and carathis who was apt to spoil him with indulgence as constantly turned him aside so that the peasants were precluded from procuring subsistence for the milch goats and ewes which providence had sent towards the district they traversed to refresh travellers with their milk all fled at the sight of the hideous animal and his strange riders as to carathis she needed no common aliment for her invention had previously furnished her with an opiate to stay her stomach some of which she imparted to her mutes at the fall of night alboufaki making a sudden stop stamped with his foot which to carathis who understood his paces was a certain indication that she was near the confines of some cemetery the moon shed a bright light on the spot which served to discover a long wall with a large door in it standing ajar and so high that alboufaki might easily enter the miserable guides who perceived their end approaching humbly implored carathis as she had now so good an opportunity to inter them and immediately gave up the ghost nerkes and cafour whose wit was of a style peculiar to themselves were by no means parsimonious of it on the folly of these poor people nor could anything have been found more suited to their tastes than the site of the buryinground and the sepulchres which its precincts contained there were at least two thousand of them on the declivity of a hill some in the form of pyramids others like columns and in short the variety of their shapes was endless carathis was too much immersed in her sublime contemplations to stop at the view charming as it appeared in her eyes pondering the advantages that might accrue from her present situation she could not forbear to exclaim so beautiful a cemetery must be haunted by gouls and they want not for intelligence having heedlessly suffered my guides to expire i will apply for directions to them and as an inducement will invite them to regale on these fresh corpses after this short soliloquy she beckoned to nerkes and cafour and made signs with her fingers as much as to say go knock against the sides of the tombs and strike up your delightful warblings that are so like to those of the guests whose company i wish to obtain the negresses full of joy at the behests of their mistress and promising themselves much pleasure from the society of the gouls went with an air of conquest and began their knockings at the tombs as their strokes were repeated a hollow noise was heard in the earth the surface hove up into heaps and the gouls on all sides protruded their noses to inhale the effluvia which the carcases of the wooden began to emit they assembled before a sarcophagus of white marble where carathis was seated between the bodies of her miserable guides the princess received her visitants with distinguished politeness and when supper was ended proceeded with them to business having soon learnt from them everything she wished to discover it was her intention to set forward forthwith on her journey but her negresses who were forming tender connections with the gouls importuned her with all their fingers to wait at least till the dawn carathis however being chastity in the abstract and an implacable enemy to love and repose at once rejected their prayer mounted alboufaki and commanded them to take their seats in a moment four days and four nights she continued her route without turning to the right hand or left on the fifth she traversed the mountains and halfurnt forests and arrived on the sixth before the beautiful screens which concealed from all eyes the voluptuous wanderings of her son it was daybreak and the guards were snoring on their posts in careless security when the rough trot of alboufaki awoke them in consternation imagining that a group of spectres ascended from the abyss was approaching they all without ceremony took to their heels vathek was at that instant with nouronihar in the bath hearing tales and laughing at bababalouk who related them but no sooner did the outcry of his guards reach him than he flounced from the water like a carp and as soon threw himself back at the sight of carathis who advancing with her negresses upon alboufaki broke through the muslin awnings and veils of the pavilion at this sudden apparition nouronihar for she was not at all times free from remors fancied that the moment of celestial vengeance was come and clung about the caliph in amorous despondence carathis still seated on her camel foamed with indignation at the spectacle which obtruded itself on her chaste view she thundered forth without check or mercy thou doubleeaded and fouregged monster what means all this winding and writhing art thou not ashamed to be seen grasping this limber sapling in preference to the sceptre of the predamite sultans is it then for this paltry doxy that thou hast violated the conditions in the parchment of our giaour is it on her thou hast lavished thy precious moments is this the fruit of the knowledge i have taught thee is this the end of thy journey tear thyself from the arms of this little simpleton drown her in the water before me and instantly follow my guidance in the first ebullition of his fury vathek resolved to make a skeleton of alboufaki and to stuff the skins of carathis and her blacks but the ideas of the giaour the palace of istakar the sabres and the talismans flashing before his imagination with the simultaneousness of lightning he became more moderate and said to his mother in a civil but decisive tone dread lady you shall be obeyed but i will not drown nouronihar she is sweeter to me than a myrabolan comfit and is enamoured of carbuncles especially that of giamschid which hath also been promised to be conferred upon her she therefore shall go along with us for i intend to repose with her beneath the canopies of soliman i can sleep no more without her be it so replied carathis alighting and at the same time committing alboufaki to the charge of her women nouronihar who had not yet quitted her hold began to take courage and said with an accent of fondness to the caliph dear sovereign of my soul i will follow thee if it be thy will beyond the kaf in the land of the afrits i will not hesitate to climb for thee the nest of the simurgh who this lady excepted is the most awful of created existences we have here then subjoined carathis a girl both of courage and science nouronihar had certainly both but notwithstanding all her firmness she could not help casting back a look of regret upon the graces of her little gulchenrouz and the days of tenderness she had participated with him she even dropped a few tears which carathis observed and inadvertently breathed out with a sigh alas my gentle cousin what will become of him vathek at this apostrophe knitted up his brows and carathis inquired what it could mean she is preposterously sighing after a stripling with languishing eyes and soft hair who loves her said the caliph where is he asked carathis i must be acquainted with this pretty child for added she lowering her voice i design before i depart to regain the favour of the giaour there is nothing so delicious in his estimation as the heart of a delicate boy palpitating with the first tumults of love vathek as he came from the bath commanded bababalouk to collect the women and other movables of his harem embody his troops and hold himself in readiness to march in three days whilst carathis retired alone to a tent where the giaour solaced her with encouraging visions but at length waking she found at her feet nerkes and cafour who informed her by their signs that having led alboufaki to the borders of a lake to browse on some moss that looked tolerably venomous they had discovered certain blue fishes of the same kind with those in the reservoir on the top of the tower ah ha said she i will go thither to them these fish are past doubt of a species that by a small operation i can render oracular they may tell me where this little gulchenrouz is whom i am bent upon sacrificing having thus spoken she immediately set out with her swarthy retinue it being but seldom that time is lost in the accomplishment of a wicked enterprise carathis and her negresses soon arrived at the lake where after burning the magical drugs with which they were always provided they stripping themselves naked waded to their chins nerkes and cafour waving torches around them and carathis pronouncing her barbarous incantations the fishes with one accord thrust forth their heads from the water which was violently rippled by the flutter of their fins and at length finding themselves constrained by the potency of the charm they opened their piteous mouths and said from gills to tail we are yours what seek ye to know fishes answered she i conjure you by your glittering scales tell me where now is gulchenrouz beyond the rock replied the shoal in full chorus will this content you for we do not delight in expanding our mouths it will returned the princess i am not to learn that you like not long conversations i will leave you therefore to repose though i had other questions to propound the instant she had spoken the water became smooth and the fishes at once disappeared carathis inflated with the venom of her projects strode hastily over the rock and found the amiable gulchenrouz asleep in an arbour whilst the two dwarfs were watching at his side and ruminating their accustomed prayers these diminutive personages possessed the gift of divining whenever an enemy to good mussulmans approached thus they anticipated the arrival of carathis who stopping short said to herself how placidly doth he recline his lovely little head how pale and languishing are his looks it is just the very child of my wishes the dwarfs interrupted this delectable soliloquy by leaping instantly upon her and scratching her face with their utmost zeal but nerkes and cafour betaking themselves to the succour of their mistress pinched the dwarfs so severely in return that they both gave up the ghost imploring mahomet to inflict his sorest vengeance upon this wicked woman and all her household at the noise which this strange conflict occasioned in the valley gulchenrouz awoke and bewildered with terror sprung impetuously upon an old figtree that rose against the acclivity of the rocks from thence gained their summits and ran for two hours without once looking back at last exhausted with fatigue he fell as if dead into the arms of a good old genius whose fondness for the company of children had made it his sole occupation to protect them and who whilst performing his wonted rounds through the air happening on the cruel giaour at the instant of his growling in the horrible chasm rescued the fifty little victims which the impiety of vathek had devoted to his maw these the genius brought up in nests still higher than the clouds and himself fixed his abode in a nest more capacious than the rest from which he had expelled the possessors that had built it these inviolable asylums were defended against the dives and the afrits by waving streamers on which were inscribed in characters of gold that flashed like lightning the names of allah and the prophet it was there that gulchenrouz who as yet remained undeceived with respect to his pretended death thought himself in the mansions of eternal peace he admitted without fear the congratulations of his little friends who were all assembled in the nest of the venerable genius and vied with each other in kissing his serene forehead and beautiful eyelids this he found to be the state congenial to his soul remote from the inquietudes of earth the impertinence of harems the brutality of eunuchs and the lubricity of women in this peacable society his days months and years glided on nor was he less happy than the rest of his companions for the genius instead of burthening his pupils with perishable riches and the vain sciences of the world conferred upon them the boon of perpetual childhood carathis unaccustomed to the loss of her prey vented a thousand execrations on her negresses for not seizing the child instead of amusing themselves with pinching to death the dwarfs from which they could gain no advantage she returned into the valley murmuring and finding that her son was not risen from the arms of nouronihar discharged her illumour upon both the idea however of departing next day for istakar and cultivating through the good offices of the giaour an intimacy with eblis himself at length consoled her chagrin but fate had ordained it otherwise in the evening as carathis was conversing with dilara who through her contrivance had become of the party and whose taste resembled her own bababalouk came to acquaint her that the sky towards samarah looked of a fiery red and seemed to portend some alarming disaster immediately recurring to her astrolabes and instruments of magic she took the altitude of the planets and discovered by her calculations to her great mortification that a formidable revolt had taken place at samarah that motavakel availing himself of the disgust which was inveterate against his brother had incited commotions amongst the populace made himself master of the palace and actually invested the great tower to which morakanabad had retired with a handful of the few that still remained faithful to vathek what exclaimed she must i lose then my tower my mutes my negresses my mummies and worse than all the laboratory in which i have spent so many a night without knowing at least if my hairrained son will complete his adventure no i will not be the dupe immediately will i speed to support morakanabad by my formidable art the clouds shall sleet hailstones in the faces of the assailants and shafts of redot iron on their heads i will spring mines of serpents and torpedos from beneath them and we shall soon see the stand they will make against such an explosion having thus spoken carathis hastened to her son who was tranquilly banqueting with nouronihar in his superb carnationoloured tent glutton that thou art cried she were it not for me thou wouldst soon find thyself the commander only of pies thy faithful subjects have abjured the faith they swore to thee motavakel thy brother now reigns on the hill of pied horses and had i not some slight resources in the tower would not be easily persuaded to abdicate but that time may not be lost i shall only add four words strike tent toight set forward and beware how thou loiterest again by the way though thou hast forfeited the conditions of the parchment i am not yet without hope for it cannot be denied that thou hast violated to admiration the laws of hospitality by seducing the daughter of the emir after having partaken of his bread and his salt such a conduct cannot but be delightful to the giaour and if on thy march thou canst signalise thyself by an additional crime all will still go well and thou shalt enter the palace of soliman in triumph adieu alboufaki and my negresses are waiting the caliph had nothing to offer in reply he wished his mother a prosperous journey and ate on till he had finished his supper at midnight the camp broke up amidst the flourishing of trumpets and other martial instruments but loud indeed must have been the sound of the tymbals to overpower the blubbering of the emir and his longeards who by an excessive profusion of tears had so far exhausted the radical moisture that their eyes shrivelled up in their sockets and their hairs dropped off by the roots nouronihar to whom such a symphony was painful did not grieve to get out of hearing she accompanied the caliph in the imperial litter where they amused themselves with imagining the splendour which was soon to surround them the other women overcome with dejection were dolefully rocked in their cages whilst dilara consoled herself with anticipating the joy of celebrating the rites of fire on the stately terraces of istakar in four days they reached the spacious valley of rocnabad the season of spring was in all its vigour and the grotesque branches of the almond trees in full blossom fantastically chequered the clear blue sky the earth variegated with hyacinths and jonquils breathed forth a fragrance which diffused through the soul a divine repose myriads of bees and scarce fewer of santons had there taken up their abode on the banks of the stream hives and oratories were alternately ranged and their neatness and whiteness were set off by the deep green of the cypresses that spired up amongst them these pious personages amused themselves with cultivating little gardens that abounded with flowers and fruits especially muskelons of the best flavour that persia could boast sometimes dispersed over the meadow they entertained themselves with feeding peacocks whiter than snow and turtles more blue than the sapphire in this manner were they occupied when the harbingers of the imperial procession began to proclaim inhabitants of rocnabad prostrate yourselves on the brink of your pure waters and tender your thanksgivings to heaven that vouchsafeth to show you a ray of its glory for lo the commander of the faithful draws near the poor santons filled with holy energy having bustled to light up wax torches in their oratories and expand the koran on their ebony desks went forth to meet the caliph with baskets of honeycomb dates and melons but whilst they were advancing in solemn procession and with measured steps the horses camels and guards wantoned over their tulips and other flowers and made a terrible havoc amongst them the santons could not help casting from one eye a look of pity on the ravages committing around them whilst the other was fixed upon the caliph and heaven nouronihar enraptured with the scenery of a place which brought back to her remembrance the pleasing solitudes where her infancy had passed entreated vathek to stop but he suspecting that each oratory might be deemed by the giaour a distinct habitation commanded his pioneers to level them all the santons stood motionless with horror at the barbarous mandate and at last broke out into lamentations but these were uttered with so ill a grace that vathek bade his eunuchs to kick them from his presence he then descended from the litter with nouronihar they sauntered together in the meadow and amused themselves with culling flowers and passing a thousand pleasantries on each other but the bees who were staunch mussulmans thinking it their duty to revenge the insult on their dear masters the santons assembled so zealously to do it with effect that the caliph and nouronihar were glad to find their tents prepared to receive them bababalouk who in capacity of purveyor had acquitted himself with applause as to peacocks and turtles lost no time in consigning some dozens to the spit and as many more to be fricasseed whilst they were feasting laughing carousing and blaspheming at pleasure on the banquet so liberally furnished the moullahs the sheiks the cadis and imams of schiraz who seemed not to have met the santon arrived leading by bridles of riband inscribed from the koran a train of asses which were loaded with the choicest fruits the country could boast having presented their offerings to the caliph they petitioned him to honour their city and mosques with his presence fancy not said vathek that you can detain me your presents i condescend to accept but beg you will let me be quiet for i am not overond of resisting temptation retire then yet as it is not decent for personages so reverend to return on foot and as you have not the appearance of expert riders my eunuchs shall tie you on your asses with the precaution that your backs be not turned towards me for they understand etiquette in this deputation were some hightomached sheiks who taking vathek for a fool scrupled not to speak their opinion these bababalouk girded with double cords and having well disciplined their asses with nettles behind they all started with a preternatural alertness plunging kicking and running foul of each other in the most ludicrous manner imaginable nouronihar and the caliph mutually contended who should most enjoy so degrading a sight they burst out in volleys of laughter to see the old men and their asses fall into the stream the leg of one was fractured the shoulder of another dislocated the teeth of a third dashed out and the rest suffered still worse two days more undisturbed by fresh embassies having been devoted to the pleasures of rocnabad the expedition proceeded leaving shiraz on the right and verging towards a large plain from whence were discernible on the edge of the horizon the dark summits of the mountains of istakar at this prospect the caliph and nouronihar were unable to repress their transports they bounded from their litter to the ground and broke forth into such wild exclamations as amazed all within hearing interrogating each other they shouted are we not approaching the radiant palace of light or gardens more delightful than those of sheddad infatuated mortals they thus indulged delusive conjecture unable to fathom the decrees of the most high the good genii who had not totally relinquished the superintendence of vathek repairing to mahomet in the seventh heaven said merciful prophet stretch forth thy propitious arms towards thy vicegerent who is ready to fall irretrievably into the snare which his enemies the dives have prepared to destroy him the giaour is awaiting his arrival in the abominable palace of fire where if he once set his foot his perdition will be inevitable mahomet answered with an air of indignation he hath too well deserved to be resigned to himself but i permit you to try if one effort more will be effectual to divert him from pursuing his ruin one of these beneficent genii assuming without delay the exterior of a shepherd more renowned for his piety than all the dervises and santons of the region took his station near a flock of white sheep on the slope of a hill and began to pour forth from his flute such airs of pathetic melody as subdued the very soul and awakening remorse drove far from it every frivolous fancy at these energetic sounds the sun hid himself beneath a gloomy cloud and the waters of two little lakes that were naturally clearer than crystal became of a colour like blood the whole of this superb assembly was involuntarily drawn towards the declivity of the hill with downcast eyes they all stood abashed each upbraiding himself with the evil he had done the heart of dilara palpitated and the chief of the eunuchs with a sigh of contrition implored pardon of the women whom for his own satisfaction he had so often tormented vathek and nouronihar turned pale in their litter and regarding each other with haggard looks reproached themselves the one with a thousand of the blackest crimes a thousand projects of impious ambition the other with the desolation of her family and the perdition of the amiable gulchenrouz nouronihar persuaded herself that she heard in the fatal music the groans of her dying father and vathek the sobs of the fifty children he had sacrificed to the giaour amidst these complicated pangs of anguish they perceived themselves impelled towards the shepherd whose countenance was so commanding that vathek for the first time felt overawed whilst nouronihar concealed her face with her hands the music paused and the genius addressing the caliph said deluded prince to whom providence hath confided the care of innumerable subjects is it thus that thou fulfillest thy mission thy crimes are already completed and art thou now hastening towards thy punishment thou knowest that beyond these mountains eblis and his accursed dives hold their infernal empire and seduced by a malignant phantom thou art proceeding to surrender thyself to them this moment is the last of grace allowed thee abandon thy atrocious purpose return give back nouronihar to her father who still retains a few sparks of life destroy thy tower with all its abominations drive carathis from thy councils be just to thy subjects respect the ministers of the prophet compensate for thy impieties by an exemplary life and instead of squandering thy days in voluptuous indulgence lament thy crimes on the sepulchres of thy ancestors thou beholdest the clouds that obscure the sun at the instant he recovers his splendour if thy heart be not changed the time of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever vathek depressed with fear was on the point of prostrating himself at the feet of the shepherd whom he perceived to be of a nature superior to man but his pride prevailing he audaciously lifted his head and glancing at him one of his terrible looks said whoever thou art withhold thy useless admonitions thou wouldst either delude me or art thyself deceived if what i have done be so criminal as thou pretendest there remains not for me a moment of grace i have traversed a sea of blood to acquire a power which will make thy equals tremble deem not that i shall retire when in view of the port or that i will relinquish her who is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy let the sun appear let him illumine my career it matters not where it may end on uttering these words which made even the genius shudder vathek threw himself into the arms of nouronihar and commanded that his horse should be forced back to the road there was no difficulty in obeying these orders for the attraction had ceased the sun shone forth in all his glory and the shepherd vanished with a lamentable scream the fatal impression of the music of the genius remained notwithstanding in the heart of vathek s attendants they viewed each other with looks of consternation at the approach of night almost all of them escaped and of this numerous assemblage there only remained the chief of the eunuchs some idolatrous slaves dilara and a few other women who like herself were votaries of the religion of the magi the caliph fired with the ambition of prescribing laws to the intelligences of darkness was but little embarrassed at this dereliction the impetuosity of his blood prevented him from sleeping nor did he encamp any more as before nouronihar whose impatience if possible exceeded his own importuned him to hasten his march and lavished on him a thousand caresses to beguile all reflection she fancied herself already more potent than balkis and pictured to her imagination the genii falling prostrate at the foot of her throne in this manner they advanced by moonlight till they came within view of the two towering rocks that form a kind of portal to the valley at whose extremity rose the vast ruins of istakar aloft on the mountain glimmered the fronts of various royal mausoleums the horror of which was deepened by the shadows of night they passed through two villages almost deserted the only inhabitants remaining being a few feeble old men who at the sight of horses and litters fell upon their knees and cried out o heaven is it then by these phantoms that we have been for six months tormented alas it was from the terror of these spectres and the noise beneath the mountains that our people have fled and left us at the mercy of maleficent spirits the caliph to whom these complaints were but unpromising auguries drove over the bodies of these wretched old men and at length arrived at the foot of the terrace of black marble there he descended from his litter handing down nouronihar both with beating hearts stared wildly around them and expected with an apprehensive shudder the approach of the giaour but nothing as yet announced his appearance a deathike stillness reigned over the mountain and through the air the moon dilated on a vast platform the shades of the lofty columns which reached from the terrace almost to the clouds the gloomy watchowers whose numbers could not be counted were veiled by no roof and their capitals of an architecture unknown in the records of the earth served as an asylum for the birds of darkness which alarmed at the approach of such visitants fled away croaking the chief of the eunuchs trembling with fear besought vathek that a fire might be kindled no replied he there is no time left to think of such trifles abide where thou art and expect my commands having thus spoken he presented his hand to nouronihar and ascending the steps of a vast staircase reached the terrace which was flagged with squares of marble and resembled a smooth expanse of water upon whose surface not a leaf ever dared to vegetate on the right rose the watchowers ranged before the ruins of an immense palace whose walls were embossed with various figures in front stood forth the colossal forms of four creatures composed of the leopard and the griffin and though but of stone inspired emotions of terror near these were distinguished by the splendour of the moon which streamed full on the place characters like those on the sabres of the giaour that possessed the same virtue of changing every moment these after vacillating for some time at last fixed in arabic letters and prescribed to the caliph the following words vathek thou hast violated the conditions of my parchment and deservest to be sent back but in favour to thy companion and as the meed for what thou hast done to obtain it eblis permitteth that the portal of his palace shall be opened and the subterranean fire will receive thee into the number of its adorers he scarcely had read these words before the mountain against which the terrace was reared trembled and the watchowers were ready to topple headlong upon them the rock yawned and disclosed within it a staircase of polished marble that seemed to approach the abyss upon each stair were planted two large torches like those nouronihar had seen in her vision the camphorated vapour ascending from which gathered into a cloud under the hollow of the vault this appearance instead of terrifying gave new courage to the daughter of fakreddin scarcely deigning to bid adieu to the moon and the firmament she abandoned without hesitation the pure atmosphere to plunge into these infernal exhalations the gait of those impious personages was haughty and determined as they descended by the effulgence of the torches they gazed on each other with mutual admiration and both appeared so resplendent that they already esteemed themselves spiritual intelligences the only circumstance that perplexed them was their not arriving at the bottom of the stairs on hastening their descent with an ardent impetuosity they felt their steps accelerated to such a degree that they seemed not walking but falling from a precipice their progress however was at length impeded by a vast portal of ebony which the caliph without difficulty recognised here the giaour awaited them with the key in his hand ye are welcome said he to them with a ghastly smile in spite of mahomet and all his dependants i will now admit you into that palace where you have so highly merited a place whilst he was uttering these words he touched the enamelled lock with his key and the doors at once expanded with a noise still louder than the thunder of mountains and as suddenly recoiled the moment they had entered the caliph and nouronihar beheld each other with amazement at finding themselves in a place which though roofed with a vaulted ceiling was so spacious and lofty that at first they took it for an immeasurable plain but their eyes at length growing familiar to the grandeur of the objects at hand they extended their view to those at a distance and discovered rows of columns and arcades which gradually diminished till they terminated in a point radiant as the sun when he darts his last beams athwart the ocean the pavement strewed over with gold dust and saffron exhaled so subtle an odour as almost overpowered them they however went on and observed an infinity of censers in which ambergris and the wood of aloes were continually burning between the several columns were placed tables each spread with a profusion of viands and wines of every species sparkling in vases of crystal a throng of genii and other fantastic spirits of each sex danced in troops at the sound of music which issued from beneath in the midst of this immense hall a vast multitude was incessantly passing who severally kept their right hands on their hearts without once regarding anything around them they had all the livid paleness of death their eyes deep sunk in their sockets resembled those phosphoric meteors that glimmer by night in places of interment some stalked slowly on absorbed in profound reverie some shrieking with agony ran furiously about like tigers wounded with poisoned arrows whilst others grinding their teeth in rage foamed along more frantic than the wildest maniac they all avoided each other and though surrounded by a multitude that no one could number each wandered at random unheedful of the rest as if alone on a desert which no foot had trodden vathek and nouronihar frozen with terror at a sight so baleful demanded of the giaour what these appearances might mean and why these ambulating spectres never withdrew their hands from their hearts perplex not yourselves replied he bluntly with so much at once you will soon be acquainted with all let us haste and present you to eblis they continued their way through the multitude but notwithstanding their confidence at first they were not sufficiently composed to examine with attention the various perspectives of halls and of galleries that opened on the right hand and left which were all illuminated by torches and braziers whose flames rose in pyramids to the centre of the vault at length they came to a place where long curtains brocaded with crimson and gold fell from all parts in striking confusion here the choirs and dances were heard no longer the light which glimmered came from afar after some time vathek and nouronihar perceived a gleam brightening through the drapery and entered a vast tabernacle carpeted with the skins of leopards an infinity of elders with streaming beards and afrits in complete armour had prostrated themselves before the ascent of a lofty eminence on the top of which upon a globe of fire sat the formidable eblis his person was that of a young man whose noble and regular features seemed to have been tarnished by malignant vapours in his large eyes appeared both pride and despair his flowing hair retained some resemblance to that of an angel of light in his hand which thunder had blasted he swayed the iron sceptre that causes the monster ouranabad the afrits and all the powers of the abyss to tremble at his presence the heart of the caliph sank within him and for the first time he fell prostrate on his face nouronihar however though greatly dismayed could not help admiring the person of eblis for she expected to have seen some stupendous giant eblis with a voice more mild than might be imagined but such as transfused through the soul the deepest melancholy said creatures of clay i receive you into mine empire ye are numbered amongst my adorers enjoy whatever this palace affords the treasures of the predamite sultans their bickering sabres and those talismans that compel the dives to open the subterranean expanses of the mountain of kaf which communicate with these there insatiable as your curiosity may be shall you find sufficient to gratify it you shall possess the exclusive privilege of entering the fortress of aherman and the halls of argenk where are portrayed all creatures endowed with intelligence and the various animals that inhabited the earth prior to the creation of that contemptible being whom ye denominate the father of mankind vathek and nouronihar feeling themselves revived and encouraged by this harangue eagerly said to the giaour bring us instantly to the place which contains these precious talismans come answered this wicked dive with his malignant grin come and possess all that my sovereign hath promised and more he then conducted them into a long aisle adjoining the tabernacle preceding them with hasty steps and followed by his disciples with the utmost alacrity they reached at length a hall of great extent and covered with a lofty dome around which appeared fifty portals of bronze secured with as many fastenings of iron a funereal gloom prevailed over the whole scene here upon two beds of incorruptible cedar lay recumbent the fleshless forms of the predamite kings who had been monarchs of the whole earth they still possessed enough of life to be conscious of their deplorable condition their eyes retained a melancholy motion they regarded each other with looks of the deepest dejection each holding his right hand motionless on his heart at their feet were inscribed the events of their several reigns their power their pride and their crimes soliman raad soliman daki and soliman gian ben gian who after having chained up the dives in the dark caverns of kaf became so presumptuous as to doubt of the supreme power all these maintained great state though not to be compared with the eminence of soliman ben daoud this king so renowned for his wisdom was on the loftiest elevation and placed immediately under the dome he appeared to possess more animation than the rest though from time to time he laboured with profound sighs and like his companions kept his right hand on his heart yet his countenance was more composed and he seemed to be listening to the sullen roar of a vast cataract visible in part through the grated portals this was the only sound that intruded on the silence of these doleful mansions a range of brazen vases surrounded the elevation remove the covers from these cabalistic depositories said the giaour to vathek and avail thyself of the talismans which will break asunder all these gates of bronze and not only render thee master of the treasures contained within them but also of the spirits by which they are guarded the caliph whom this ominous preliminary had entirely disconcerted approached the vases with faltering footsteps and was ready to sink with terror when he heard the groans of soliman as he proceeded a voice from the livid lips of the prophet articulated these words in my lifeime i filled a magnificent throne having on my right hand twelve thousand seats of gold where the patriarchs and the prophets heard my doctrines on my left the sages and doctors upon as many thrones of silver were present at all my decisions whilst i thus administered justice to innumerable multitudes the birds of the air librating over me served as a canopy from the rays of the sun my people flourished and my palace rose to the clouds i erected a temple to the most high which was the wonder of the universe but i basely suffered myself to be seduced by the love of women and a curiosity that could not be restrained by sublunary things i listened to the counsels of aherman and the daughter of pharaoh and adored fire and the hosts of heaven i forsook the holy city and commanded the genii to rear the stupendous palace of istakar and the terrace of the watchowers each of which was consecrated to a star there for a while i enjoyed myself in the zenith of glory and pleasure not only men but supernatural existences were subject also to my will i began to think as these unhappy monarchs around had already thought that the vengeance of heaven was asleep when at once the thunder burst my structures asunder and precipitated me hither where however i do not remain like the other inhabitants totally destitute of hope for an angel of light hath revealed that in consideration of the piety of my early youth my woes shall come to an end when this cataract shall for ever cease to flow till then i am in torments ineffable torments an unrelenting fire preys on my heart having uttered this exclamation soliman raised his hands towards heaven in token of supplication and the caliph discerned through his bosom which was transparent as crystal his heart enveloped in flames at a sight so full of horror nouronihar fell back like one petrified into the arms of vathek who cried out with a convulsive sob o giaour whither hast thou brought us allow us to depart and i will relinquish all thou hast promised o mahomet remains there no more mercy none none replied the malicious dive know miserable prince thou art now in the abode of vengeance and despair thy heart also will be kindled like those of the other votaries of eblis a few days are allotted thee previous to this fatal period employ them as thou wilt recline on these heaps of gold command the infernal potentates range at thy pleasure through these immense subterranean domains no barrier shall be shut against thee as for me i have fulfilled my mission i now leave thee to thyself at these words he vanished the caliph and nouronihar remained in the most abject affliction their tears unable to flow scarcely could they support themselves at length taking each other despondingly by the hand they went faltering from this fatal hall indifferent which way they turned their steps every portal opened at their approach the dives fell prostrate before them every reservoir of riches was disclosed to their view but they no longer felt the incentives of curiosity pride or avarice with like apathy they heard the chorus of genii and saw the stately banquets prepared to regale them they went wandering on from chamber to chamber hall to hall and gallery to gallery all without bounds or limit all distinguishable by the same lowering gloom all adorned with the same awful grandeur all traversed by persons in search of repose and consolation but who sought them in vain for every one carried within him a heart tormented in flames shunned by these various sufferers who seemed by their looks to be upbraiding the partners of their guilt they withdrew from them to wait in direful suspense the moment which should render them to each other the like objects of terror what exclaimed nouronihar will the time come when i shall snatch my hand from thine ah said vathek and shall my eyes ever cease to drink from thine long draughts of enjoyment shall the moments of our reciprocal ecstasies be reflected on with horror it was not thou that broughtest me hither the principles by which carathis perverted my youth have been the sole cause of my perdition having given vent to these painful expressions he called to an afrit who was stirring up one of the braziers and bade him fetch the princess carathis from the palace of samarah after issuing these orders the caliph and nouronihar continued walking amidst the silent crowd till they heard voices at the end of the gallery presuming them to proceed from some unhappy beings who like themselves were awaiting their final doom they followed the sound and found it to come from a small square chamber where they discovered sitting on sofas five young men of goodly figure and a lovely female who were all holding a melancholy conversation by the glimmering of a lonely lamp each had a gloomy and forlorn air and two of them were embracing each other with great tenderness on seeing the caliph and the daughter of fakreddin enter they arose saluted and gave them place then he who appeared the most considerable of the group addressed himself thus to vathek strangers who doubtless are in the same state of suspense with ourselves as you do not yet bear your hands on your hearts if you are come hither to pass the interval allotted previous to the infliction of our common punishment condescend to relate the adventures that have brought you to this fatal place and we in return will acquaint you with ours which deserve but too well to be heard we will trace back our crimes to their source though we are not permitted to repent this is the only employment suited to wretches like us the caliph and nouronihar assented to the proposal and vathek began not without tears and lamentations a sincere recital of every circumstance that had passed when the afflicting narrative was closed the young man entered on his own each person proceeded in order and when the fourth prince had reached the midst of his adventures a sudden noise interrupted him which caused the vault to tremble and to open immediately a cloud descended which gradually dissipating discovered carathis on the back of an afrit who grievously complained of his burden she instantly springing to the ground advanced towards her son and said what dost thou here in this little square chamber as the dives are become subject to thy beck i expected to have found thee on the throne of the predamite kings execrable woman answered the caliph cursed be the day thou gavest me birth go follow this afrit let him conduct thee to the hall of the prophet soliman there thou wilt learn to what these palaces are destined and how much i ought to abhor the impious knowledge thou hast taught me the height of power to which thou art arrived has certainly turned thy brain answered carathis but i ask no more than permission to show my respect for the prophet it is however proper thou shouldest know that as the afrit has informed me neither of us shall return to samara i requested his permission to arrange my affairs and he politely consented availing myself therefore of the few moments allowed me i set fire to the tower and consumed in it the mutes negresses and serpents which have rendered me so much good service nor should i have been less kind to morakanabad had he not prevented me by deserting at last to thy brother as for bababalouk who had the folly to return to samarah and all the good brotherhood to provide husbands for thy wives i undoubtedly would have put them to the torture could i but have allowed them the time being however in a hurry i only hung him after having caught him in a snare with thy wives whilst them i buried alive by the help of my negresses who thus spent their last moments greatly to their satisfaction with respect to dilara who ever stood high in my favour she hath evinced the greatness of her mind by fixing herself near in the service of one of the magi and i think will soon be our own vathek too much cast down to express the indignation excited by such a discourse ordered the afrit to remove carathis from his presence and continued immersed in thought which his companion durst not disturb carathis however eagerly entered the dome of soliman and without regarding in the least the groans of the prophet undauntedly removed the covers of the vases and violently seized on the talismans then with a voice more loud than had hitherto been heard within these mansions she compelled the dives to disclose to her the most secret treasures the most profound stores which the afrit himself had not seen she passed by rapid descents known only to eblis and his most favoured potentates and thus penetrated the very entrails of the earth where breathes the sansar or icy wind of death nothing appalled her dauntless soul she perceived however in all the inmates who bore their hands on their hearts a little singularity not much to her taste as she was emerging from one of the abysses eblis stood forth to her view but notwithstanding he displayed the full effulgence of his infernal majesty she preserved her countenance unaltered and even paid her compliments with considerable firmness this superb monarch thus answered princess whose knowledge and whose crimes have merited a conspicuous rank in my empire thou dost well to employ the leisure that remains for the flames and torments which are ready to seize on thy heart will not fail to provide thee with full employment he said this and was lost in the curtains of his tabernacle
