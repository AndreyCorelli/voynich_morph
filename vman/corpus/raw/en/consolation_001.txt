who wrought my studious numbers smoothly once in happier days now perforce in tears and sadness learn a mournful strain to raise lo the muses griefishevelled guide my pen and voice my woe down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops to my sad complainings flow these alone in danger hour faithful found have dared attend on the footsteps of the exile to his lonely journey end these that were the pride and pleasure of my youth and high estate still remain the only solace of the old man mournful fate old ah yes swift ere i knew it by these sorrows on me pressed age hath come lo grief hath bid me wear the garb that fits her best or my head untimely sprinkled these white hairs my woes proclaim and the skin hangs loose and shrivelled on this sorrowhrunken frame blest is death that intervenes not in the sweet sweet years of peace but unto the brokenearted when they call him brings release yet death passes by the wretched shuts his ear and slumbers deep will not heed the cry of anguish will not close the eyes that weep for while yet inconstant fortune poured her gifts and all was bright death dark hour had all but whelmed me in the gloom of endless night now because misfortune shadow hath orclouded that false face cruel life still halts and lingers though i loathe his weary race friends why did ye once so lightly vaunt me happy among men surely he who so hath fallen was not firmly founded then i while i was thus mutely pondering within myself and recording my sorrowful complainings with my pen it seemed to me that there appeared above my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable her eyes were bright as fire and of a more than human keenness her complexion was lively her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement and yet her years were right full and she plainly seemed not of our age and time her stature was difficult to judge at one moment it exceeded not the common height at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky and whenever she raised her head higher she began to pierce within the very heavens and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her her garments were of an imperishable fabric wrought with the finest threads and of the most delicate workmanship and these as her own lips afterwards assured me she had herself woven with her own hands the beauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect and wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure on the lowerost edge was inwoven the greek letter greek on the topmost the letter greek t and between the two were to be seen steps like a staircase from the lower to the upper letter this robe moreover had been torn by the hands of violent persons who had each snatched away what he could clutch her right hand held a noteook in her left she bore a staff and when she saw the muses of poesie standing by my bedside dictating the words of my lamentations she was moved awhile to wrath and her eyes flashed sternly ho said she as allowed yon playcting wantons to approach this sick man these who so far from giving medicine to heal his malady even feed it with sweet poison these it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the barren thorns of passion who accustom men minds to disease instead of setting them free now were it some common man whom your allurements were seducing as is usually your way i should be less indignant on such a one i should not have spent my pains for naught but this is one nurtured in the eleatic and academic philosophies nay get ye gone ye sirens whose sweetness lasteth not leave him for my muses to tend and heal at these words of upbraiding the whole band in deepened sadness with downcast eyes and blushes that confessed their shame dolefully left the chamber but i because my sight was dimmed with much weeping and i could not tell who was this woman of authority so commanding i was dumfoundered and with my gaze fastened on the earth continued silently to await what she might do next then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my couch and looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in sadness on the ground she bewailed in these words the disorder of my mind alas in what abyss his mind is plunged how wildly tossed still still towards the outer night she sinks her true light lost as oft as lashed tumultuously by earthorn blasts care waves rise high yet once he ranged the open heavens the sun bright pathway tracked watched how the cold moon waxed and waned nor rested till there lacked to his wide ken no star that steers amid the maze of circling spheres the causes why the blusterous winds vex ocean tranquil face whose hand doth turn the stable globe or why his even race from out the ruddy east the sun unto the western waves doth run what is it tempers cunningly the placid hours of spring so that it blossoms with the rose for earth engarlanding who loads the year maturer prime with clustered grapes in autumn time all this he knew thus ever strove deep nature lore to guess now reft of reason light he lies and bonds his neck oppress while by the heavy load constrained his eyes to this dull earth are chained ut the time said she alls rather for healing than for lamentation then with her eyes bent full upon me rt thou that man she cries ho erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the nourishment which is mine to give had grown up to the full vigour of a manly spirit and yet i had bestowed such armour on thee as would have proved an invincible defence hadst thou not first cast it away dost thou know me why art thou silent is it shame or amazement that hath struck thee dumb would it were shame but as i see a stupor hath seized upon thee then when she saw me not only answering nothing but mute and utterly incapable of speech she gently touched my breast with her hand and said here is no danger these are the symptoms of lethargy the usual sickness of deluded minds for awhile he has forgotten himself he will easily recover his memory if only he first recognises me and that he may do so let me now wipe his eyes that are clouded with a mist of mortal things thereat with a fold of her robe she dried my eyes all swimming with tears song the mists dispelled then the gloom of night was scattered sight returned unto mine eyes so when haply rainy caurus rolls the stormlouds through the skies hidden is the sun all heaven is obscured in starless night but if in wild onset sweeping boreas frees day prisoned light all suddenly the radiant god outstreams and strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams even so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up i saw the clear sky and regained the power to recognise the face of my physician accordingly when i had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her i beheld my nurse philosophy whose halls i had frequented from my youth up h why i cried istress of all excellence hast thou come down from on high and entered the solitude of this my exile is it that thou too even as i mayst be persecuted with false accusations ould i desert thee child said she nd not lighten the burden which thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name by sharing this trouble even forgetting that it were not lawful for philosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent should i thinkest thou fear to incur reproach or shrink from it as though some strange new thing had befallen thinkest thou that now for the first time in an evil age wisdom hath been assailed by peril did i not often in days of old before my servant plato lived wage stern warfare with the rashness of folly in his lifetime too socrates his master won with my aid the victory of an unjust death and when one after the other the epicurean herd the stoic and the rest each of them as far as in them lay went about to seize the heritage he left and were dragging me off protesting and resisting as their booty they tore in pieces the garment which i had woven with my own hands and clutching the torn pieces went off believing that the whole of me had passed into their possession and some of them because some traces of my vesture were seen upon them were destroyed through the mistake of the lewd multitude who falsely deemed them to be my disciples it may be thou knowest not of the banishment of anaxagoras of the poison draught of socrates nor of zeno torturing because these things happened in a distant country yet mightest thou have learnt the fate of arrius of seneca of soranus whose stories are neither old nor unknown to fame these men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that settled as they were in my principles their lives were a manifest contrast to the ways of the wicked so there is nothing thou shouldst wonder at if on the seas of this life we are tossed by stormlasts seeing that we have made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with eviloers and though maybe the host of the wicked is many in number yet is it contemptible since it is under no leadership but is hurried hither and thither at the blind driving of mad error and if at times and seasons they set in array against us and fall on in overwhelming strength our leader draws off her forces into the citadel while they are busy plundering the useless baggage but we from our vantage ground safe from all this wild work laugh to see them making prize of the most valueless of things protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may not aspire to reach song nothing can subdue virtue whoso calm serene sedate sets his foot on haughty fate firm and steadfast come what will keeps his mien unconquered still him the rage of furious seas tossing high wild menaces nor the flames from smoky forges that vesuvius disgorges nor the bolt that from the sky smites the tower can terrify why then shouldst thou feel affright at the tyrant weakling might dread him not nor fear no harm and thou shall his rage disarm but who to hope or fear gives way lost his bosom rightful sway he hath cast away his shield like a coward fled the field he hath forged all unaware fetters his own neck must bear ost thou understand she asks do my words sink into thy mind or art thou dull as the ass to the sound of the lyre why dost thou weep why do tears stream from thy eyes speak out hide it not in thy heart if thou lookest for the physician help thou must needs disclose thy wound then i gathering together what strength i could began s there still need of telling is not the cruelty of fortune against me plain enough doth not the very aspect of this place move thee is this the library the room which thou hadst chosen as thy constant resort in my home the place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all things in heaven and earth was my garb and mien like this when i explored with thee nature hid secrets and thou didst trace for me with thy wand the courses of the stars moulding the while my character and the whole conduct of my life after the pattern of the celestial order is this the recompense of my obedience yet thou hast enjoined by plato mouth the maxim that states would be happy either if philosophers ruled them or if it should so befall that their rulers would turn philosophers by his mouth likewise thou didst point out this imperative reason why philosophers should enter public life to wit lest if the reins of government be left to unprincipled and profligate citizens trouble and destruction should come upon the good following these precepts i have tried to apply in the business of public administration the principles which i learnt from thee in leisured seclusion thou art my witness and that divinity who hath implanted thee in the hearts of the wise that i brought to my duties no aim but zeal for the public good for this cause i have become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds and as happens inevitably if a man holds fast to the independence of conscience i have had to think nothing of giving offence to the powerful in the cause of justice how often have i encountered and balked conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes of the weak how often have i thwarted trigguilla steward of the king household even when his villainous schemes were as good as accomplished how often have i risked my position and influence to protect poor wretches from the false charges innumerable with which they were for ever being harassed by the greed and license of the barbarians no one has ever drawn me aside from justice to oppression when ruin was overtaking the fortunes of the provincials through the combined pressure of private rapine and public taxation i grieved no less than the sufferers when at a season of grievous scarcity a forced sale disastrous as it was unjustifiable was proclaimed and threatened to overwhelm campania with starvation i embarked on a struggle with the pr torian prefect in the public interest i fought the case at the king judgmenteat and succeeded in preventing the enforcement of the sale i rescued the consular paulinus from the gaping jaws of the court bloodhounds who in their covetous hopes had already made short work of his wealth to save albinus who was of the same exalted rank from the penalties of a prejudged charge i exposed myself to the hatred of cyprian the informer hinkest thou i had laid up for myself store of enmities enough well with the rest of my countrymen at any rate my safety should have been assured since my love of justice had left me no hope of security at court yet who was it brought the charges by which i have been struck down why one of my accusers is basil who after being dismissed from the king household was driven by his debts to lodge an information against my name there is opilio there is gaudentius men who for many and various offences the king sentence had condemned to banishment and when they declined to obey and sought to save themselves by taking sanctuary the king as soon as he heard of it decreed that if they did not depart from the city of ravenna within a prescribed time they should be branded on the forehead and expelled what would exceed the rigour of this severity and yet on that same day these very men lodged an information against me and the information was admitted just heaven had i deserved this by my way of life did it make them fit accusers that my condemnation was a foregone conclusion has fortune no shame if not at the accusation of the innocent at least for the vileness of the accusers perhaps thou wonderest what is the sum of the charges laid against me i wished they say to save the senate but how i am accused of hindering an informer from producing evidence to prove the senate guilty of treason tell me then what is thy counsel o my mistress shall i deny the charge lest i bring shame on thee but i did wish it and i shall never cease to wish it shall i admit it then the work of thwarting the informer will come to an end shall i call the wish for the preservation of that illustrious house a crime of a truth the senate by its decrees concerning me has made it such but blind folly though it deceive itself with false names cannot alter the true merits of things and mindful of the precept of socrates i do not think it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood to pass but this however it may be i leave to thy judgment and to the verdict of the discerning moreover lest the course of events and the true facts should be hidden from posterity i have myself committed to writing an account of the transaction hat need to speak of the forged letters by which an attempt is made to prove that i hoped for the freedom of rome their falsity would have been manifest if i had been allowed to use the confession of the informers themselves evidence which has in all matters the most convincing force why what hope of freedom is left to us would there were any i should have answered with the epigram of canius when caligula declared him to have been cognisant of a conspiracy against him if i had known said he thou shouldst never have known grief hath not so blunted my perceptions in this matter that i should complain because impious wretches contrive their villainies against the virtuous but at their achievement of their hopes i do exceedingly marvel for evil purposes are perchance due to the imperfection of human nature that it should be possible for scoundrels to carry out their worst schemes against the innocent while god beholdeth is verily monstrous for this cause not without reason one of thy disciples asked if god exists whence comes evil yet whence comes good if he exists not however it might well be that wretches who seek the blood of all honest men and of the whole senate should wish to destroy me also whom they saw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest men but did i deserve such a fate from the fathers also thou rememberest methinks since thou didst ever stand by my side to direct what i should do or say thou rememberest i say how at verona when the king eager for the general destruction was bent on implicating the whole senatorial order in the charge of treason brought against albinus with what indifference to my own peril i maintained the innocence of its members one and all thou knowest that what i say is the truth and that i have never boasted of my good deeds in a spirit of selfraise for whenever a man by proclaiming his good deeds receives the recompense of fame he diminishes in a measure the secret reward of a good conscience what issues have overtaken my innocency thou seest instead of reaping the rewards of true virtue i undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely laid to my charge nay more than this never did an open confession of guilt cause such unanimous severity among the assessors but that some consideration either of the mere frailty of human nature or of fortune universal instability availed to soften the verdict of some few had i been accused of a design to fire the temples to slaughter the priests with impious sword of plotting the massacre of all honest men i should yet have been produced in court and only punished on due confession or conviction now for my too great zeal towards the senate i have been condemned to outlawry and death unheard and undefended at a distance of near five hundred miles away oh my judges well do ye deserve that no one should hereafter be convicted of a fault like mine et even my very accusers saw how honourable was the charge they brought against me and in order to overlay it with some shadow of guilt they falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition i had stained my conscience with sacrilegious acts and yet thy spirit indwelling in me had driven from the chamber of my soul all lust of earthly success and with thine eye ever upon me there could be no place left for sacrilege for thou didst daily repeat in my ear and instil into my mind the pythagorean maxim follow after god it was not likely then that i should covet the assistance of the vilest spirits when thou wert moulding me to such an excellence as should conform me to the likeness of god again the innocency of the inner sanctuary of my home the company of friends of the highest probity a fathernaw revered at once for his pure character and his active beneficence shield me from the very suspicion of sacrilege yet atrocious as it is they even draw credence for this charge from thee i am like to be thought implicated in wickedness on this very account that i am imbued with thy teachings and stablished in thy ways so it is not enough that my devotion to thee should profit me nothing but thou also must be assailed by reason of the odium which i have incurred verily this is the very crown of my misfortunes that men opinions for the most part look not to real merit but to the event and only recognise foresight where fortune has crowned the issue with her approval whereby it comes to pass that reputation is the first of all things to abandon the unfortunate i remember with chagrin how perverse is popular report how various and discordant men judgments this only will i say that the most crushing of misfortune burdens is that as soon as a charge is fastened upon the unhappy they are believed to have deserved their sufferings i for my part who have been banished from all life blessings stripped of my honours stained in repute am punished for welloing nd now methinks i see the villainous dens of the wicked surging with joy and gladness all the most recklessly unscrupulous threatening a new crop of lying informations the good prostrate with terror at my danger every ruffian incited by impunity to new daring and to success by the profits of audacity the guiltless not only robbed of their peace of mind but even of all means of defence wherefore i would fain cry out uilder of yon starry dome thou that whirlest throned eternal heaven swift globe and as they roam guidt the stars by laws supernal so in fullphered splendour dight cynthia dims the lamps of night but unto the orb fraternal closer drawn doth lose her light ho at fall of eventide hesper his cold radiance showeth lucifer his beams doth hide paling as the sun light groweth brief while winter frost holds sway by thy will the space of day swift when summer fervour gloweth speed the hours of night away hou dost rule the changing year when rude boreas oppresses fall the leaves they reappear wooed by zephyr soft caresses fields that sirius burns deep grown by arcturus watch were sown each the reign of law confesses keeps the place that is his own overeign ruler lord of all can it be that thou disdainest only man ainst him poor thrall wanton fortune plays her vainest guilt deserved punishment falleth on the innocent high uplifted the profanest on the just their malice vent irtue cowers in dark retreats crime foul stain the righteous beareth perjury and false deceits hurt not him the wrong who dareth but whener the wicked trust in ill strength to work their lust kings whom nations awe declareth mighty grovel in the dust oh look upon this earth thou who on law sure foundation framedst all have we no worth we poor men of all creation sore we toss on fortune tide master bid the waves subside and earth ways with consummation of thy heaven order guide when i had poured out my griefs in this long and unbroken strain of lamentation she with calm countenance and in no wise disturbed at my complainings thus spake hen i saw thee sorrowful in tears i straightway knew thee wretched and an exile but how far distant that exile i should not know had not thine own speech revealed it yet how far indeed from thy country hast thou not been banished but rather hast strayed or if thou wilt have it banishment hast banished thyself for no one else could ever lawfully have had this power over thee now if thou wilt call to mind from what country thou art sprung it is not ruled as once was the athenian polity by the sovereignty of the multitude but one is its ruler one its king who takes delight in the number of his citizens not in their banishment to submit to whose governance and to obey whose ordinances is perfect freedom art thou ignorant of that most ancient law of this thy country whereby it is decreed that no one whatsoever who hath chosen to fix there his dwelling may be sent into exile for truly there is no fear that one who is encompassed by its ramparts and defences should deserve to be exiled but he who has ceased to wish to dwell therein he likewise ceases to deserve to do so and so it is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me as thy aspect not so much the library walls set off with glass and ivory which i miss as the chamber of thy mind wherein i once placed not books but that which gives books their value the doctrines which my books contain now what thou hast said of thy services to the commonweal is true only too little compared with the greatness of thy deservings the things laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken whether such as redound to thy credit or mere false accusations are publicly known as for the crimes and deceits of the informers thou hast rightly deemed it fitting to pass them over lightly because the popular voice hath better and more fully pronounced upon them thou hast bitterly complained of the injustice of the senate thou hast grieved over my calumniation and likewise hast lamented the damage to my good name finally thine indignation blazed forth against fortune thou hast complained of the unfairness with which thy merits have been recompensed last of all thy frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace which reigns in heaven might rule earth also but since a throng of tumultuous passions hath assailed thy soul since thou art distraught with anger pain and grief strong remedies are not proper for thee in this thy present mood and so for a time i will use milder methods that the tumours which have grown hard through the influx of disturbing passion may be softened by gentle treatment till they can bear the force of sharper remedies he who to th unwilling furrows gives the generous grain when the crab with baleful fervours scorches all the plain he shall find his garner bare acorns for his scanty fare go not forth to cull sweet violets from the purpled steep while the furious blasts of winter through the valleys sweep nor the grape orhasty bring to the press in days of spring for to each thing god hath given its appointed time no perplexing change permits he in his plan sublime so who quits the order due shall a luckless issue rue irst then wilt thou suffer me by a few questions to make some attempt to test the state of thy mind that i may learn in what way to set about thy cure sk what thou wilt said i or i will answer whatever questions thou choosest to put then said she his world of ours thinkest thou it is governed haphazard and fortuitously or believest thou that there is in it any rational guidance ay said i n no wise may i deem that such fixed motions can be determined by random hazard but i know that god the creator presideth over his work nor will the day ever come that shall drive me from holding fast the truth of this belief es said she hou didst even but now affirm it in song lamenting that men alone had no portion in the divine care as to the rest thou wert unshaken in the belief that they were ruled by reason yet i marvel exceedingly how in spite of thy firm hold on this opinion thou art fallen into sickness but let us probe more deeply something or other is missing i think now tell me since thou doubtest not that god governs the world dost thou perceive by what means he rules it scarcely understand what thou meanest i said uch less can i answer thy question id i not say truly that something is missing whereby as through a breach in the ramparts disease hath crept in to disturb thy mind but tell me dost thou remember the universal end towards which the aim of all nature is directed once heard said i ut sorrow hath dulled my recollection nd yet thou knowest whence all things have proceeded es that i know said i nd have answered that it is from god et how is it possible that thou knowest not what is the end of existence when thou dost understand its source and origin however these disturbances of mind have force to shake a man position but cannot pluck him up and root him altogether out of himself but answer this also i pray thee rememberest thou that thou art a man ow should i not said i hen canst thou say what man is s this thy question whether i know myself for a being endowed with reason and subject to death surely i do acknowledge myself such then she ost know nothing else that thou art othing ow said she know another cause of thy disease one too of grave moment thou hast ceased to know thy own nature so then i have made full discovery both of the causes of thy sickness and the means of restoring thy health it is because forgetfulness of thyself hath bewildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile as one stripped of the blessings that were his it is because thou knowest not the end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked men to be happy and powerful while because thou hast forgotten by what means the earth is governed thou deemest that fortune changes ebb and flow without the restraint of a guiding hand these are serious enough to cause not sickness only but even death but thanks be to the author of our health the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly in thy true judgment concerning the world government in that thou believest it subject not to the random drift of chance but to divine reason we have the divine spark from which thy recovery may be hoped have then no fear from these weak embers the vital heat shall once more be kindled within thee but seeing that it is not yet time for strong remedies and that the mind is manifestly so constituted that when it casts off true opinions it straightway puts on false wherefrom arises a cloud of confusion that disturbs its true vision i will now try and disperse these mists by mild and soothing application that so the darkness of misleading passion may be scattered and thou mayst come to discern the splendour of the true light song the perturbations of passion stars shed no light through the black night when the clouds hide and the lashed wave if the winds rave or ocean tide though once serene as day fair sheen soon fouled and spoiled by the storm spite shows to the sight turbid and soiled oft the fair rill down the steep hill seaward that strays some tumbled block of fallen rock hinders and stays then art thou fain clear and most plain truth to discern in the right way firmly to stay nor from it turn joy hope and fear suffer not near drive grief away shackled and blind and lost is the mind where these have sway book the vanity of fortune gifts summary ch i philosophy reproves boethius for the foolishness of his complaints against fortune her very nature is caprice ch philosophy in fortune name replies to boethius reproaches and proves that the gifts of fortune are hers to give and to take away ch boethius falls back upon his present sense of misery philosophy reminds him of the brilliancy of his former fortunes ch boethius objects that the memory of past happiness is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy philosophy shows that much is still left for which he may be thankful none enjoy perfect satisfaction with their lot but happiness depends not on anything which fortune can give it is to be sought within ch all the gifts of fortune are external they can never truly be our own man cannot find his good in worldly possessions riches bring anxiety and trouble ch high place without virtue is an evil not a good power is an empty name ch fame is a thing of little account when compared with the immensity of the universe and the endlessness of time ch one service only can fortune do when she reveals her own nature and distinguishes true friends from false book i thereafter for awhile she remained silent and when she had restored my flagging attention by a moderate pause in her discourse she thus began f i have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of thy sickness thou art pining with regretful longing for thy former fortune it is the change as thou deemest of this fortune that hath so wrought upon thy mind well do i understand that siren manifold wiles the fatal charm of the friendship she pretends for her victims so long as she is scheming to entrap them how she unexpectedly abandons them and leaves them overwhelmed with insupportable grief bethink thee of her nature character and deserts and thou wilt soon acknowledge that in her thou hast neither possessed nor hast thou lost aught of any worth methinks i need not spend much pains in bringing this to thy mind since even when she was still with thee even while she was caressing thee thou usedst to assail her in manly terms to rebuke her with maxims drawn from my holy treasureouse but all sudden changes of circumstances bring inevitably a certain commotion of spirit thus it hath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from thy mind tranquillity but it is time for thee to take and drain a draught soft and pleasant to the taste which as it penetrates within may prepare the way for stronger potions wherefore i call to my aid the sweet persuasiveness of rhetoric who then only walketh in the right way when she forsakes not my instructions and music my handmaid i bid to join with her singing now in lighter now in graver strain hat is it then poor mortal that hath cast thee into lamentation and mourning some strange unwonted sight methinks have thine eyes seen thou deemest fortune to have changed towards thee thou mistakest such ever were her ways ever such her nature rather in her very mutability hath she preserved towards thee her true constancy such was she when she loaded thee with caresses when she deluded thee with the allurements of a false happiness thou hast found out how changeful is the face of the blind goddess she who still veils herself from others hath fully discovered to thee her whole character if thou likest her take her as she is and do not complain if thou abhorrest her perfidy turn from her in disdain renounce her for baneful are her delusions the very thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have brought thee tranquillity thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one can be sure that she will not forsake him or dost thou indeed set value on a happiness that is certain to depart again i ask is fortune presence dear to thee if she cannot be trusted to stay and though she will bring sorrow when she is gone why if she cannot be kept at pleasure and if her flight overwhelms with calamity what is this fleeting visitant but a token of coming trouble truly it is not enough to look only at what lies before the eyes wisdom gauges the issues of things and this same mutability with its two aspects makes the threats of fortune void of terror and her caresses little to be desired finally thou oughtest to bear with whatever takes place within the boundaries of fortune demesne when thou hast placed thy head beneath her yoke but if thou wishest to impose a law of staying and departing on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for thy mistress art thou not acting wrongfully art thou not embittering by impatience a lot which thou canst not alter didst thou commit thy sails to the winds thou wouldst voyage not whither thy intention was to go but whither the winds drave thee didst thou entrust thy seed to the fields thou wouldst set off the fruitful years against the barren thou hast resigned thyself to the sway of fortune thou must submit to thy mistress caprices what art thou verily striving to stay the swing of the revolving wheel oh stupidest of mortals if it takes to standing still it ceases to be the wheel of fortune song i fortune malice mad fortune sweeps along in wanton pride uncertain as euripus surging tide now tramples mighty kings beneath her feet now sets the conquered in the victor seat she heedeth not the wail of hapless woe but mocks the griefs that from her mischief flow such is her sport so proveth she her power and great the marvel when in one brief hour she shows her darling lifted high in bliss then headlong plunged in misery abyss ow i would fain also reason with thee a little in fortune own words do thou observe whether her contentions be just man she might say why dost thou pursue me with thy daily complainings what wrong have i done thee what goods of thine have i taken from thee choose an thou wilt a judge and let us dispute before him concerning the rightful ownership of wealth and rank if thou succeedest in showing that any one of these things is the true property of mortal man i freely grant those things to be thine which thou claimest when nature brought thee forth out of thy mother womb i took thee naked and destitute as thou wast i cherished thee with my substance and in the partiality of my favour for thee i brought thee up somewhat too indulgently and this it is which now makes thee rebellious against me i surrounded thee with a royal abundance of all those things that are in my power now it is my pleasure to draw back my hand thou hast reason to thank me for the use of what was not thine own thou hast no right to complain as if thou hadst lost what was wholly thine why then dost bemoan thyself i have done thee no violence wealth honour and all such things are placed under my control my handmaidens know their mistress with me they come and at my going they depart i might boldly affirm that if those things the loss of which thou lamentest had been thine thou couldst never have lost them am i alone to be forbidden to do what i will with my own unrebuked the skies now reveal the brightness of day now shroud the daylight in the darkness of night the year may now engarland the face of the earth with flowers and fruits now disfigure it with storms and cold the sea is permitted to invite with smooth and tranquil surface toay toorrow to roughen with wave and storm shall man insatiate greed bind me to a constancy foreign to my character this is my art this the game i never cease to play i turn the wheel that spins i delight to see the high come down and the low ascend mount up if thou wilt but only on condition that thou wilt not think it a hardship to come down when the rules of my game require it wert thou ignorant of my character didst not know how cr sus king of the lydians erstwhile the dreaded rival of cyrus was afterwards pitiably consigned to the flame of the pyre and only saved by a shower sent from heaven has it caped thee how paullus paid a meed of pious tears to the misfortunes of king perseus his prisoner what else do tragedies make such woeful outcry over save the overthrow of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes of fortune didst thou not learn in thy childhood how there stand at the threshold of zeus wo jars he one full of blessings the other of calamities how if thou hast drawn overiberally from the good jar what if not even now have i departed wholly from thee what if this very mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better things but listen now and cease to let thy heart consume away with fretfulness nor expect to live on thine own terms in a realm that is common to all song man covetousness what though plenty pour her gifts with a lavish hand numberless as are the stars countless as the sand will the race of man content cease to murmur and lament nay though god allounteous give gold at man desire honours rank and fame content not a whit is nigher but an allevouring greed yawns with everidening need then what bounds can er restrain this wild lust of having when with each new bounty fed grows the frantic craving he is never rich whose fear sees grim want forever near f fortune should plead thus against thee assuredly thou wouldst not have one word to offer in reply or if thou canst find any justification of thy complainings thou must show what it is i will give thee space to speak then said i erily thy pleas are plausible yea steeped in the honeyed sweetness of music and rhetoric but their charm lasts only while they are sounding in the ear the sense of his misfortunes lies deeper in the heart of the wretched so when the sound ceases to vibrate upon the air the heart indwelling sorrow is felt with renewed bitterness then said she t is indeed as thou sayest for we have not yet come to the curing of thy sickness as yet these are but lenitives conducing to the treatment of a malady hitherto obstinate the remedies which go deep i will apply in due season nevertheless to deprecate thy determination to be thought wretched i ask thee hast thou forgotten the extent and bounds of thy felicity i say nothing of how when orphaned and desolate thou wast taken into the care of illustrious men how thou wast chosen for alliance with the highest in the state and even before thou wert bound to their house by marriage wert already dear to their love which is the most precious of all ties did not all pronounce thee most happy in the virtues of thy wife the splendid honours of her father and the blessing of male issue i pass over for i care not to speak of blessings in which others also have shared the distinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in thy youth i choose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of thy good fortune if the fruition of any earthly success has weight in the scale of happiness can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any rising flood of troubles that day when thou didst see thy two sons ride forth from home joint consuls followed by a train of senators and welcomed by the goodill of the people when these two sat in curule chairs in the senateouse and thou by thy panegyric on the king didst earn the fame of eloquence and ability when in the circus seated between the two consuls thou didst glut the multitude thronging around with the triumphal largesses for which they looked methinks thou didst cozen fortune while she caressed thee and made thee her darling thou didst bear off a boon which she had never before granted to any private person art thou then minded to cast up a reckoning with fortune now for the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee if thou compare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes thou canst not deny that thou art still fortunate or if thou esteem not thyself favoured by fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity hath departed deem not thyself wretched since what thou now believest to be calamitous passeth also what art thou but now come suddenly and a stranger to the scene of this life thinkest thou there is any stability in human affairs when man himself vanishes away in the swift course of time it is true that there is little trust that the gifts of chance will abide yet the last day of life is in a manner the death of all remaining fortune what difference then thinkest thou is there whether thou leavest her by dying or she leave thee by fleeing away song all passes when in rosy chariot drawn ph bus ins to light the dawn by his flaming beams assailed every glimmering star is paled when the grove by zephyrs fed with roselossom blushes red doth rude auster breathe thereon bare it stands its glory gone smooth and tranquil lies the deep while the winds are hushed in sleep soon when angry tempests lash wild and high the billows dash thus if nature changing face holds not still a moment space fleeting deem man fortunes deem bliss as transient as a dream one law only standeth fast things created may not last then said i rue are thine admonishings thou nurse of all excellence nor can i deny the wonder of my fortune swift career yet it is this which chafes me the more cruelly in the recalling for truly in adverse fortune the worst sting of misery is to have been happy ell said she f thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief thou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances if it is the felicity which fortune gives that moves thee mere name though it be come reckon up with me how rich thou art in the number and weightiness of thy blessings then if by the blessing of providence thou hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which howsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune thou wouldst have thought thy most precious possession what right hast thou to talk of illortune whilst keeping all fortune better gifts yet symmachus thy wife father a man whose splendid character does honour to the human race is safe and unharmed and while he bewails thy wrongs this rare nature in whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly blended is himself out of danger a boon thou wouldst have been quick to purchase at the price of life itself thy wife yet lives with her gentle disposition her peerless modesty and virtue this the epitome of all her graces that she is the true daughter of her sire she lives i say and for thy sake only preserves the breath of life though she loathes it and pines away in grief and tears for thy absence wherein if in naught else i would allow some marring of thy felicity what shall i say of thy sons and their consular dignity how in them so far as may be in youths of their age the example of their father and grandfather character shines out since then the chief care of mortal man is to preserve his life how happy art thou couldst thou but recognise thy blessings who possessest even now what no one doubts to be dearer than life wherefore now dry thy tears fortune hate hath not involved all thy dear ones the stress of the storm that has assailed thee is not beyond measure intolerable since there are anchors still holding firm which suffer thee not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for the future pray that they still may hold for while they still remain however things may go i shall ride out the storm yet thou seest how much is shorn of the splendour of my fortunes e are gaining a little ground said she f there is something in thy lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented but i cannot stomach thy daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief and anxiety because thy happiness falls short of completeness why who enjoys such settled felicity as not to have some quarrel with the circumstances of his lot a troublous matter are the conditions of human bliss either they are never realized in full or never stay permanently one has abundant riches but is shamed by his ignoble birth another is conspicuous for his nobility but through the embarrassments of poverty would prefer to be obscure a third richly endowed with both laments the loneliness of an unwedded life another though happily married is doomed to childlessness and nurses his wealth for a stranger to inherit yet another blest with children mournfully bewails the misdeeds of son or daughter wherefore it is not easy for anyone to be at perfect peace with the circumstances of his lot there lurks in each several portion something which they who experience it not know nothing of but which makes the sufferer wince besides the more favoured a man is by fortune the more fastidiously sensitive is he and unless all things answer to his whim he is overwhelmed by the most trifling misfortunes because utterly unschooled in adversity so petty are the trifles which rob the most fortunate of perfect happiness how many are there dost thou imagine who would think themselves nigh heaven if but a small portion from the wreck of thy fortune should fall to them this very place which thou callest exile is to them that dwell therein their native land so true is it that nothing is wretched but thinking makes it so and conversely every lot is happy if borne with equanimity who is so blest by fortune as not to wish to change his state if once he gives rein to a rebellious spirit with how many bitternesses is the sweetness of human felicity blent and even if that sweetness seem to him to bring delight in the enjoying yet he cannot keep it from departing when it will how manifestly wretched then is the bliss of earthly fortune which lasts not for ever with those whose temper is equable and can give no perfect satisfaction to the anxiousinded hy then ye children of mortality seek ye from without that happiness whose seat is only within us error and ignorance bewilder you i will show thee in brief the hinge on which perfect happiness turns is there anything more precious to thee than thyself nothing thou wilt say if then thou art master of thyself thou wilt possess that which thou wilt never be willing to lose and which fortune cannot take from thee and that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly consist in these things which are the sport of chance reflect that if happiness is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with reason and if a thing which can in any wise be reft away is not the highest good since that which cannot be taken away is better than it it is plain that fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of its instability and besides a man borne along by this transitory felicity must either know or not know its unstability if he knows not how poor is a happiness which depends on the blindness of ignorance if he knows it he needs must fear to lose a happiness whose loss he believes to be possible wherefore a nevereasing fear suffers him not to be happy or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling matter insignificant then must be the good whose loss can be borne so equably and further i know thee to be one settled in the belief that the souls of men certainly die not with them and convinced thereof by numerous proofs it is clear also that the felicity which fortune bestows is brought to an end with the death of the body therefore it cannot be doubted but that if happiness is conferred in this way the whole human race sinks into misery when death brings the close of all but if we know that many have sought the joy of happiness not through death only but also through pain and suffering how can life make men happy by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss song the golden mean who founded firm and sure would ever live secure in spite of storm and blast immovable and fast whoso would fain deride the ocean threatening tide his dwelling should not seek on sands or mountaineak upon the mountain height the storminds wreak their spite the shifting sands disdain their burden to sustain do thou these perils flee fair though the prospect be and fix thy restinglace on some low rock sure base then though the tempests roar seas thunder on the shore thou in thy stronghold blest and undisturbed shalt rest live all thy days serene and mock the heavens spleen ut since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within thy mind methinks i may resort to remedies somewhat stronger come suppose now the gifts of fortune were not fleeting and transitory what is there in them capable of ever becoming truly thine or which does not lose value when looked at steadily and fairly weighed in the balance are riches i pray thee precious either through thy nature or in their own what are they but mere gold and heaps of money yet these fine things show their quality better in the spending than in the hoarding for i suppose is plain that greed alva makes men hateful while liberality brings fame but that which is transferred to another cannot remain in one own possession and if that be so then money is only precious when it is given away and by being transferred to others ceases to be one own again if all the money in the world were heaped up in one man possession all others would be made poor sound fills the ears of many at the same time without being broken into parts but your riches cannot pass to many without being lessened in the process and when this happens they must needs impoverish those whom they leave how poor and cramped a thing then is riches which more than one cannot possess as an unbroken whole which falls not to any one man lot without the impoverishment of everyone else or is it the glitter of gems that allures the eye yet how rarely excellent soever may be their splendour remember the flashing light is in the jewels not in the man indeed i greatly marvel at men admiration of them for what can rightly seem beautiful to a being endowed with life and reason if it lack the movement and structure of life and although such things do in the end take on them more beauty from their maker care and their own brilliancy still they in no wise merit your admiration since their excellence is set at a lower grade than your own oes the beauty of the fields delight you surely yes it is a beautiful part of a right beautiful whole fitly indeed do we at times enjoy the serene calm of the sea admire the sky the stars the moon the sun yet is any of these thy concern dost thou venture to boast thyself of the beauty of any one of them art thou decked with spring flowers is it thy fertility that swelleth in the fruits of autumn why art thou moved with empty transports why embracest thou an alien excellence as thine own never will fortune make thine that which the nature of things has excluded from thy ownership doubtless the fruits of the earth are given for the sustenance of living creatures but if thou art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature there is no need to resort to fortune bounty nature is content with few things and with a very little of these if thou art minded to force superfluities upon her when she is satisfied that which thou addest will prove either unpleasant or harmful but now thou thinkest it fine to shine in raiment of divers colours yet if indeed there is any pleasure in the sight of such things it is the texture or the artist skill which i shall admire r perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee happy why if they behave viciously they are a ruinous burden to thy house and exceeding dangerous to their own master while if they are honest how canst thou count other men virtue in the sum of thy possessions from all which is plainly proved that not one of these things which thou reckonest in the number of thy possessions is really thine and if there is in them no beauty to be desired why shouldst thou either grieve for their loss or find joy in their continued possession while if they are beautiful in their own nature what is that to thee they would have been not less pleasing in themselves though never included among thy possessions for they derive not their preciousness from being counted in thy riches but rather thou hast chosen to count them in thy riches because they seemed to thee precious hen what seek ye by all this noisy outcry about fortune to chase away poverty i ween by means of abundance and yet ye find the result just contrary why this varied array of precious furniture needs more accessories for its protection it is a true saying that they want most who possess most and conversely they want very little who measure their abundance by nature requirements not by the superfluity of vain display have ye no good of your own implanted within you that ye seek your good in things external and separate is the nature of things so reversed that a creature divine by right of reason can in no other way be splendid in his own eyes save by the possession of lifeless chattels yet while other things are content with their own ye who in your intellect are godike seek from the lowest of things adornment for a nature of supreme excellence and perceive not how great a wrong ye do your maker his will was that mankind should excel all things on earth ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of things for if that in which each thing finds its good is plainly more precious than that whose good it is by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of things when ye deem these vile things to be your good nor does this fall out undeservedly indeed man is so constituted that he then only excels other things when he knows himself but he is brought lower than the beasts if he lose this selfnowledge for that other creatures should be ignorant of themselves is natural in man it shows as a defect how extravagant then is this error of yours in thinking that anything can be embellished by adornments not its own it cannot be for if such accessories add any lustre it is the accessories that get the praise while that which they veil and cover remains in its pristine ugliness and again i say that is no good which injures its possessor is this untrue no quite true thou sayest and yet riches have often hurt those that possessed them since the worst of men who are all the more covetous by reason of their wickedness think none but themselves worthy to possess all the gold and gems the world contains so thou who now dreadest pike and sword mightest have trolled a carol in the robber face hadst thou entered the road of life with empty pockets oh wondrous blessedness of perishable wealth whose acquisition robs thee of security song the former age too blest the former age their life who in the fields contented led and still by luxury unspoiled on frugal acorns sparely fed no skill was theirs the luscious grape with honey sweetness to confuse nor china soft and sheeny silks t empurple with brave tyrian hues the grass their wholesome couch their drink the stream their roof the pine tall shade not theirs to cleave the deep nor seek in strange far lands the spoils of trade the trump of war was heard not yet nor soiled the fields by bloodshed stain for why should war fierce madness arm when strife brought wound but brought not gain ah would our hearts might still return to following in those ancient ways alas the greed of getting glows more fierce than etna fiery blaze woe woe for him whoer it was who first gold hidden store revealed and perilous treasurerove dug out the gems that fain would be concealed hat now shall i say of rank and power whereby because ye know not true power and dignity ye hope to reach the sky yet when rank and power have fallen to the worst of men did ever an etna belching forth flame and fiery deluge work such mischief verily as i think thou dost remember how thine ancestors sought to abolish the consular power which had been the foundation of their liberties on account of the overweening pride of the consuls and how for that selfame pride they had already abolished the kingly title and if as happens but rarely these prerogatives are conferred on virtuous men it is only the virtue of those who exercise them that pleases so it appears that honour cometh not to virtue from rank but to rank from virtue look too at the nature of that power which ye find so attractive and glorious do ye never consider ye creatures of earth what ye are and over whom ye exercise your fancied lordship suppose now that in the mouse tribe there should rise up one claiming rights and powers for himself above the rest would ye not laugh consumedly yet if thou lookest to his body alone what creature canst thou find more feeble than man who oftentimes is killed by the bite of a fly or by some insect creeping into the inner passage of his system yet what rights can one exercise over another save only as regards the body and that which is lower than the body i mean fortune what wilt thou bind with thy mandates the free spirit canst thou force from its due tranquillity the mind that is firmly composed by reason a tyrant thought to drive a man of free birth to reveal his accomplices in a conspiracy but the prisoner bit off his tongue and threw it into the furious tyrant face thus the tortures which the tyrant thought the instrument of his cruelty the sage made an opportunity for heroism moreover what is there that one man can do to another which he himself may not have to undergo in his turn we are told that busiris who used to kill his guests was himself slain by his guest hercules regulus had thrown into bonds many of the carthaginians whom he had taken in war soon after he himself submitted his hands to the chains of the vanquished then thinkest thou that man hath any power who cannot prevent another being able to do to him what he himself can do to others esides if there were any element of natural and proper good in rank and power they would never come to the utterly bad since opposites are not wont to be associated nature brooks not the union of contraries so seeing there is no doubt that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in high places it is also clear that things which suffer association with the worst of men cannot be good in their own nature indeed this judgment may with some reason be passed concerning all the gifts of fortune which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked this ought also to be considered here i think no one doubts a man to be brave in whom he has observed a brave spirit residing it is plain that one who is endowed with speed is swiftooted so also music makes men musical the healing art physicians rhetoric public speakers for each of these has naturally its own proper working there is no confusion with the effects of contrary things nay even of itself it rejects what is incompatible and yet wealth cannot extinguish insatiable greed nor has power ever made him master of himself whom vicious lusts kept bound in indissoluble fetters dignity conferred on the wicked not only fails to make them worthy but contrarily reveals and displays their unworthiness why does it so happen because ye take pleasure in calling by false names things whose nature is quite incongruous thereto by names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the things themselves even so it is these riches that power this dignity are none of them rightly so called finally we may draw the same conclusion concerning the whole sphere of fortune within which there is plainly nothing to be truly desired nothing of intrinsic excellence for she neither always joins herself to the good nor does she make good men of those to whom she is united song neros infamy we know what mischief dire he wrought rome fired the fathers slain whose hand with brother slaughter wet a mother blood did stain no pitying tear his cheek bedewed as on the corse he gazed that mother beauty once so fair a critic voice appraised yet far and wide from east to west his sway the nations own and scorching south and icy north obey his will alone did then high power a curb impose on nero phrenzied will ah woe when to the evil heart is joined the sword to kill then said i hou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success hath but little swayed me yet i have desired opportunity for action lest virtue in default of exercise should languish away then she his is that last infirmity which is able to allure minds which though of noble quality have not yet been moulded to any exquisite refinement by the perfecting of the virtues i mean the love of glory and fame for high services rendered to the commonweal and yet consider with me how poor and unsubstantial a thing this glory is the whole of this earth globe as thou hast learnt from the demonstration of astronomy compared with the expanse of heaven is found no bigger than a point that is to say if measured by the vastness of heaven sphere it is held to occupy absolutely no space at all now of this so insignificant portion of the universe it is about a fourth part as ptolemy proofs have taught us which is inhabited by living creatures known to us if from this fourth part you take away in thought all that is usurped by seas and marshes or lies a vast waste of waterless desert barely is an exceeding narrow area left for human habitation you then who are shut in and prisoned in this merest fraction of a point space do ye take thought for the blazoning of your fame for the spreading abroad of your renown why what amplitude or magnificence has glory when confined to such narrow and petty limits esides the straitened bounds of this scant dwellinglace are inhabited by many nations differing widely in speech in usages in mode of life to many of these from the difficulty of travel from diversities of speech from want of commercial intercourse the fame not only of individual men but even of cities is unable to reach why in cicero days as he himself somewhere points out the fame of the roman republic had not yet crossed the caucasus and yet by that time her name had grown formidable to the parthians and other nations of those parts seest thou then how narrow how confined is the glory ye take pains to spread abroad and extend can the fame of a single roman penetrate where the glory of the roman name fails to pass moreover the customs and institutions of different races agree not together so that what is deemed praise worthy in one country is thought punishable in another wherefore if any love the applause of fame it shall not profit him to publish his name among many peoples then each must be content to have the range of his glory limited to his own people the splendid immortality of fame must be confined within the bounds of a single race nce more how many of high renown in their own times have been lost in oblivion for want of a record indeed of what avail are written records even which with their authors are overtaken by the dimness of age after a somewhat longer time but ye when ye think on future fame fancy it an immortality that ye are begetting for yourselves why if thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity what room hast thou left for rejoicing in the durability of thy name verily if a single moment space be compared with ten thousand years it has a certain relative duration however little since each period is definite but this same number of years ay and a number many times as great cannot even be compared with endless duration for indeed finite periods may in a sort be compared one with another but a finite and an infinite never so it comes to pass that fame though it extend to ever so wide a space of years if it be compared to neveressening eternity seems not shortived merely but altogether nothing but as for you ye know not how to act aright unless it be to court the popular breeze and win the empty applause of the multitude nay ye abandon the superlative worth of conscience and virtue and ask a recompense from the poor words of others let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of this sort of arrogance a certain man assailed one who had put on the name of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vainlory not for the practice of real virtue and added now shall i know if thou art a philosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently the other for awhile affected to be patient and having endured to be abused cried out derisively now do you see that i am a philosopher the other with biting sarcasm retorted i should have hadst thou held thy peace moreover what concern have choice spirits for it is of such men we speak men who seek glory by virtue what concern i say have these with fame after the dissolution of the body in death last hour for if men die wholly which our reasonings forbid us to believe there is no such thing as glory at all since he to whom the glory is said to belong is altogether nonxistent but if the mind conscious of its own rectitude is released from its earthly prison and seeks heaven in free flight doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its deliverance from earthly bonds and enters upon the joys of heaven song glory may not last oh let him who pants for glory guerdon deeming glory all in all look and see how wide the heaven expandeth earth enclosing bounds how small shame it is if your proudwelling glory may not fill this narrow room why then strive so vainly oh ye proud ones to escape your mortal doom though your name to distant regions bruited or the earth be widely spread though full many a loftyounding title on your house its lustre shed death at all this pomp and glory spurneth when his hour draweth nigh shrouds alike th exalted and the humble levels lowest and most high where are now the bones of stanch fabricius brutus cato where are they lingering fame with a few graven letters doth their empty name display but to know the great dead is not given from a gilded name alone nay ye all alike must lie forgotten is not you that fame makes known fondly do ye deem life little hour lengthened by fame mortal breath there but waits you when this too is taken at the last a second death ut that thou mayst not think that i wage implacable warfare against fortune i own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men well i mean when she reveals herself uncovers her face and confesses her true character perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning strange is the thing i am trying to express and for this cause i can scarce find words to make clear my thought for truly i believe that ill fortune is of more use to men than good fortune for good fortune when she wears the guise of happiness and most seems to caress is always lying ill fortune is always truthful since in changing she shows her inconstancy the one deceives the other teaches the one enchains the minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good the other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of happiness accordingly thou mayst see the one fickle shifting as the breeze and ever selfeceived the other soberinded alert and wary by reason of the very discipline of adversity finally good fortune by her allurements draws men far from the true good ill fortune ofttimes draws men back to true good with grapplingrons again should it be esteemed a trifling boon thinkest thou that this cruel this odious fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends that other hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the false but in departing she hath taken away her friends and left thee thine what price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the fulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate cease then to seek the wealth thou hast lost since in true friends thou hast found the most precious of all riches song love is lord of all why are nature changes bound to a fixed and ordered round what to leagu peace hath bent every warring element wherefore doth the rosy morn rise on ph bus car upborne why should ph be rule the night led by hesper guiding light what the power that doth restrain in his place the restless main that within fixed bounds he keeps nor or earth in deluge sweeps love it is that holds the chains love or sea and earth that reigns love whom else but sovereign love love high lord in heaven above yet should he his care remit all that now so close is knit in sweet love and holy peace would no more from conflict cease but with strife rude shock and jar all the world fair fabric mar tribes and nations love unites by just treaty sacred rites wedlock bonds he sanctifies by affection softest ties love appointeth as is due faithful laws to comrades true love allovereign love oh then ye are blest ye sons of men if the love that rules the sky in your hearts is throned on high book true happiness and false summary ch i boethius beseeches philosophy to continue she promises to lead him to true happiness ch happiness is the one end which all created beings seek they aim variously at wealth or rank or sovereignty or glory or pleasure because they think thereby to attain either contentment reverence power renown or gladness of heart in one or other of which they severally imagine happiness to consist ch philosophy proceeds to consider whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways so far from bringing contentment riches only add to men wants ch high position cannot of itself win respect titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands they even fall into contempt through lapse of time ch sovereignty cannot even bestow safety history tells of the downfall of kings and their ministers tyrants go in fear of their lives ch fame conferred on the unworthy is but disgrace the splendour of noble birth is not a man own but his ancestors ch pleasure begins in the restlessness of desire and ends in repentance even the pure pleasures of home may turn to gall and bitterness ch all fail then to give what they promise there is moreover some accompanying evil involved in each of these aims beauty and bodily strength are likewise of little worth in strength man is surpassed by the brutes beauty is but outward show ch the source of men error in following these phantoms of good is that they break up and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible contentment power reverence renown and joy are essentially bound up one with the other and if they are to be attained at all must be attained together true happiness if it can be found will include them all but it cannot be found among the perishable things hitherto considered ch such a happiness necessarily exists its seat is in god nay god is very happiness and in a manner therefore the happy man partakes also of the divine nature all other ends are relative to this good since they are all pursued only for the sake of good it is good which is the sole ultimate end and since the sole end is also happiness it is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same ch unity is another aspect of goodness now all things subsist so long only as they preserve the unity of their being when they lose this unity they perish but the bent of nature forces all things plants and inanimate things as well as animal to strive to continue in life therefore all things desire unity for unity is essential to life but unity and goodness were shown to be the same therefore good is proved to be the end towards which the whole universe tends ch boethius acknowledges that he is but recollecting truths he once knew philosophy goes on to show that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed boethius professes compunction for his former folly but the paradox of evil is introduced and he is once more perplexed she ceased but i stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment and eager expectation my ears still strained to listen and then after a little i said hou sovereign solace of the stricken soul what refreshment hast thou brought me no less by the sweetness of thy singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse verily i think not that i shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of fortune wherefore i no longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe for my strength nay rather i am eager to hear of them and call for them with all vehemence then said she marked thee fastening upon my words silently and intently and i expected or to speak more truly i myself brought about in thee this state of mind what now remains is of such sort that to the taste indeed it is biting but when received within it turns to sweetness but whereas thou dost profess thyself desirous of hearing with what ardour wouldst thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither it is my task to lead thee hither said i o true felicity said she hich even now thy spirit sees in dreams but cannot behold in very truth while thine eyes are engrossed with semblances then said i beseech thee do thou show to me her true shape without a moment loss ladly will i for thy sake said she ut first i will try to sketch in words and describe a cause which is more familiar to thee that when thou hast viewed this carefully thou mayst turn thy eyes the other way and recognise the beauty of true happiness song i the thorns of error who fain would sow the fallow field and see the growing corn must first remove the useless weeds the bramble and the thorn after ill savour honey taste is to the mouth more sweet after the storm the twinkling stars the eyes more cheerly greet when night hath past the bright dawn comes in car of rosy hue so drive the false bliss from thy mind and thou shall see the true for a little space she remained in a fixed gaze withdrawn as it were into the august chamber of her mind then she thus began mortal creatures in those anxious aims which find employment in so many varied pursuits though they take many paths yet strive to reach one goal the goal of happiness now the good is that which when a man hath got he can lack nothing further this it is which is the supreme good of all containing within itself all particular good so that if anything is still wanting thereto this cannot be the supreme good since something would be left outside which might be desired is clear then that happiness is a state perfected by the assembling together of all good things to this state as we have said all men try to attain but by different paths for the desire of the true good is naturally implanted in the minds of men only error leads them aside out of the way in pursuit of the false some deeming it the highest good to want for nothing spare no pains to attain affluence others judging the good to be that to which respect is most worthily paid strive to win the reverence of their fellowitizens by the attainment of official dignity some there are who fix the chief good in supreme power these either wish themselves to enjoy sovereignty or try to attach themselves to those who have it those again who think renown to be something of supreme excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name either through the arts of war or of peace a great many measure the attainment of good by joy and gladness of heart these think it the height of happiness to give themselves over to pleasure others there are again who interchange the ends and means one with the other in their aims for instance some want riches for the sake of pleasure and power some covet power either for the sake of money or in order to bring renown to their name so it is on these ends then that the aim of human acts and wishes is centred and on others like to these for instance noble birth and popularity which seem to compass a certain renown wife and children which are sought for the sweetness of their possession while as for friendship the most sacred kind indeed is counted in the category of virtue not of fortune but other kinds are entered upon for the sake of power or of enjoyment and as for bodily excellences it is obvious that they are to be ranged with the above for strength and stature surely manifest power beauty and fleetness of foot bring celebrity health brings pleasure it is plain then that the only object sought for in all these ways is happiness for that which each seeks in preference to all else that is in his judgment the supreme good and we have defined the supreme good to be happiness therefore that state which each wishes in preference to all others is in his judgment happy hou hast then set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human happiness wealth rank power glory pleasure now epicurus from a sole regard to these considerations with some consistency concluded the highest good to be pleasure because all the other objects seem to bring some delight to the soul but to return to human pursuits and aims man mind seeks to recover its proper good in spite of the mistiness of its recollection but like a drunken man knows not by what path to return home think you they are wrong who strive to escape want nay truly there is nothing which can so well complete happiness as a state abounding in all good things needing nothing from outside but wholly selfufficing do they fall into error who deem that which is best to be also best deserving to receive the homage of reverence not at all that cannot possibly be vile and contemptible to attain which the endeavours of nearly all mankind are directed then is power not to be reckoned in the category of good why can that which is plainly more efficacious than anything else be esteemed a thing feeble and void of strength or is renown to be thought of no account nay it cannot be ignored that the highest renown is constantly associated with the highest excellence and what need is there to say that happiness is not haunted by care and gloom nor exposed to trouble and vexation since that is a condition we ask of the very least of things from the possession and enjoyment of which we expect delight so then these are the blessings men wish to win they want riches rank sovereignty glory pleasure because they believe that by these means they will secure independence reverence power renown and joy of heart therefore it is the good which men seek by such divers courses and herein is easily shown the might of nature power since although opinions are so various and discordant yet they agree in cherishing good as the end song the bent of nature how the might of nature sways all the world in ordered ways how resistless laws control each least portion of the whole fain would i in sounding verse on my pliant strings rehearse lo the lion captive tan meekly wears his gilded chain yet though he by hand be fed though a master whip he dread if but once the taste of gore whet his cruel lips once more straight his slumbering fierceness wakes with one roar his bonds he breaks and first wreaks his vengeful force on his trainer mangled corse and the woodland songster pent in forlorn imprisonment though a mistress lavish care store of honeyed sweets prepare yet if in his narrow cage as he hops from bar to bar he should spy the woods afar cool with sheltering foliage all these dainties he will spurn to the woods his heart will turn only for the woods he longs pipes the woods in all his songs to rude force the sapling bends while the hand its pressure lends if the hand its pressure slack straight the supple wood springs back ph bus in the western main sinks but swift his car again by a secret path is borne to the wonted gates of morn thus are all things seen to yearn in due time for due return and no order fixed may stay save which in th appointed way joins the end to the beginning in a steady cycle spinning e too creatures of earth have some glimmering of your origin however faint and though in a vision dim and clouded yet in some wise notwithstanding ye discern the true end of happiness and so the aim of nature leads you thither to that true good while error in many forms leads you astray therefrom for reflect whether men are able to win happiness by those means through which they think to reach the proposed end truly if either wealth rank or any of the rest bring with them anything of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is good we too acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition of these things but if they are not able to fulfil their promises and moreover lack many good things is not the happiness men seek in them clearly discovered to be a false show therefore do i first ask thee thyself who but lately wert living in affluence amid all that abundance of wealth was thy mind never troubled in consequence of some wrong done to thee ay said i cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so completely at peace as not to feel the pang of some uneasiness as it not because either something was absent which thou wouldst not have absent or present which thou wouldst have away es said i hen thou didst want the presence of the one the absence of the other dmitted ut a man lacks that of which he is in want e does nd he who lacks something is not in all points selfufficing o certainly not said i o wert thou then in the plenitude of thy wealth supporting this insufficiency must have been ealth then cannot make its possessor independent and free from all want yet this was what it seemed to promise moreover i think this also well deserves to be considered that there is nothing in the special nature of money to hinder its being taken away from those who possess it against their will admit it hy of course when every day the stronger wrests it from the weaker without his consent else whence come lawsuits except in seeking to recover moneys which have been taken away against their owner will by force or fraud rue said i hen everyone will need some extraneous means of protection to keep his money safe ho can venture to deny it et he would not unless he possessed the money which it is possible to lose o he certainly would not hen we have worked round to an opposite conclusion the wealth which was thought to make a man independent rather puts him in need of further protection how in the world then can want be driven away by riches cannot the rich feel hunger cannot they thirst are not the limbs of the wealthy sensitive to the winter cold but thou wilt say the rich have the wherewithal to sate their hunger the means to get rid of thirst and cold true enough want can thus be soothed by riches wholly removed it cannot be for if this everaping everraving want is glutted by wealth it needs must be that the want itself which can be so glutted still remains i do not speak of how very little suffices for nature and how for avarice nothing is enough wherefore if wealth cannot get rid of want and makes new wants of its own how can ye believe that it bestows independence song the insatiableness of avarice though the covetous grown wealthy see his piles of gold rise high though he gather store of treasure that can never satisfy though with pearls his gorget blazes rarest that the ocean yields though a hundred head of oxen travail in his ample fields ner shall carking care forsake him while he draws this vital breath and his riches go not with him when his eyes are closed in death ell but official dignity clothes him to whom it comes with honour and reverence have then offices of state such power as to plant virtue in the minds of their possessors and drive out vice nay they are rather wont to signalize iniquity than to chase it away and hence arises our indignation that honours so often fall to the most iniquitous of men accordingly catullus calls nonius an ulcerpot though sitting in the curule chair dost not see what infamy high position brings upon the bad surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their rank does not draw upon them the public notice in thy own case wouldst thou ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing office with decoratus since thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a rascally parasite and informer no we cannot deem men worthy of reverence on account of their office whom we deem unworthy of the office itself but didst thou see a man endued with wisdom couldst thou suppose him not worthy of reverence nor of that wisdom with which he was endued o certainly not here is in virtue a dignity of her own which she forthwith passes over to those to whom she is united and since public honours cannot do this it is clear that they do not possess the true beauty of dignity and here this well deserves to be noticed that if a man is the more scorned in proportion as he is despised by a greater number high position not only fails to win reverence for the wicked but even loads them the more with contempt by drawing more attention to them but not without retribution for the wicked pay back a return in kind to the dignities they put on by the pollution of their touch perhaps too another consideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence cannot come through these counterfeit dignities it is this if one who had been many times consul chanced to visit barbaric lands would his office win him the reverence of the barbarians and yet if reverence were the natural effect of dignities they would not forego their proper function in any part of the world even as fire never anywhere fails to give forth heat but since this effect is not due to their own efficacy but is attached to them by the mistaken opinion of mankind they disappear straightway when they are set before those who do not esteem them dignities thus the case stands with foreign peoples but does their repute last for ever even in the land of their origin why the prefecture which was once a great power is now an empty name a burden merely on the senator fortune the commissioner of the public corn supply was once a personage now what is more contemptible than this office for as we said just now that which hath no true comeliness of its own now receives now loses lustre at the caprice of those who have to do with it so then if dignities cannot win men reverence if they are actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked if they lose their splendour through time changes if they come into contempt merely for lack of public estimation what precious beauty have they in themselves much less to give to others song disgrace of honours conferred by a tyrant though royal purple soothes his pride and snowy pearls his neck adorn nero in all his riot lives the mark of universal scorn yet he on reverend heads conferred th inglorious honours of the state shall we then deem them truly blessed whom such preferment hath made great ell then does sovereignty and the intimacy of kings prove able to confer power why surely does not the happiness of kings endure for ever and yet antiquity is full of examples and these days also of kings whose happiness has turned into calamity how glorious a power which is not even found effectual for its own preservation but if happiness has its source in sovereign power is not happiness diminished and misery inflicted in its stead in so far as that power falls short of completeness yet however widely human sovereignty be extended there must still be more peoples left over whom each several king holds no sway now at whatever point the power on which happiness depends ceases here powerlessness steals in and makes wretchedness so by this way of reckoning there must needs be a balance of wretchedness in the lot of the king the tyrant who had made trial of the perils of his condition figured the fears that haunt a throne under the image of a sword hanging over a man head what sort of power then is this which cannot drive away the gnawings of anxiety or shun the stings of terror fain would they themselves have lived secure but they cannot then they boast about their power dost thou count him to possess power whom thou seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass dost thou count him to possess power who encompasses himself with a bodyuard who fears those he terrifies more than they fear him who to keep up the semblance of power is himself at the mercy of his slaves need i say anything of the friends of kings when i show royal dominion itself so utterly and miserably weak why ofttimes the royal power in its plenitude brings them low ofttimes involves them in its fall nero drove his friend and preceptor seneca to the choice of the manner of his death antoninus exposed papinianus who was long powerful at court to the swords of the soldiery yet each of these was willing to renounce his power seneca tried to surrender his wealth also to nero and go into retirement but neither achieved his purpose when they tottered their very greatness dragged them down what manner of thing then is this power which keeps men in fear while they possess it which when thou art fain to keep thou art not safe and when thou desirest to lay it aside thou canst not rid thyself of are friends any protection who have been attached by fortune not by virtue nay him whom good fortune has made a friend ill fortune will make an enemy and what plague is more effectual to do hurt than a foe of one own household song selfastery who on power sets his aim first must his own spirit tame he must shun his neck to thrust eath th unholy yoke of lust for though india farff land bow before his wide command utmost thule homage pay if he cannot drive away haunting care and black distress in his power he powerless gain how misleading how base a thing ofttimes is glory well does the tragic poet exclaim oh fond repute how many a time and oft hast them raised high in pride the baseorn churl for many have won a great name through the mistaken beliefs of the multitude and what can be imagined more shameful than that nay they who are praised falsely must needs themselves blush at their own praises and even when praise is won by merit still how does it add to the good conscience of the wise man who measures his good not by popular repute but by the truth of inner conviction and if at all it does seem a fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad it follows that any failure so to spread it is held foul but if as i set forth but now there must needs be many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single man cannot reach it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems all inglorious in a neighbouring quarter of the globe as to popular favour i do not think it even worthy of mention in this place since it never cometh of judgment and never lasteth steadily hen again who does not see how empty how foolish is the fame of noble birth why if the nobility is based on renown the renown is another for truly nobility seems to be a sort of reputation coming from the merits of ancestors but if it is the praise which brings renown of necessity it is they who are praised that are famous wherefore the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if thou hast none of thine own so if there is any excellence in nobility of birth methinks it is this alone that it would seem to impose upon the nobly born the obligation not to degenerate from the virtue of their ancestors song true nobility all men are of one kindred stock though scattered far and wide for one is father of us all one doth for all provide he gave the sun his golden beams the moon her silver horn he set mankind upon the earth as stars the heavens adorn he shut a soul a heavenorn soul within the body frame the noble origin he gave each mortal wight may claim why boast ye then so loud of race and high ancestral line if ye behold your being source and god supreme design none is degenerate none base unless by taint of sin and cherished vice he foully stain his heavenly origin hen what shall i say of the pleasures of the body the lust thereof is full of uneasiness the sating of repentance what sicknesses what intolerable pains are they wont to bring on the bodies of those who enjoy them the fruits of iniquity as it were now what sweetness the stimulus of pleasure may have i do not know but that the issues of pleasure are painful everyone may understand who chooses to recall the memory of his own fleshly lusts nay if these can make happiness there is no reason why the beasts also should not be happy since all their efforts are eagerly set upon satisfying the bodily wants i know indeed that the sweetness of wife and children should be right comely yet only too true to nature is what was said of one that he found in his sons his tormentors and how galling such a contingency would be i must needs put thee in mind since thou hast never in any wise suffered such experiences nor art thou now under any uneasiness in such a case i agree with my servant euripides who said that a man without children was fortunate in his misfortune this is the way of pleasure she stings them that despoil her and like the wing toiler who lost her honeyed treasure she flies but leaves her smart deepankling in the heart t is beyond doubt then that these paths do not lead to happiness they cannot guide anyone to the promised goal now i will very briefly show what serious evils are involved in following them just consider is it thy endeavour to heap up money why thou must wrest it from its present possessor art thou minded to put on the splendour of official dignity thou must beg from those who have the giving of it thou who covetest to outvie others in honour must lower thyself to the humble posture of petition dost thou long for power thou must face perils for thou wilt be at the mercy of thy subjects plots is glory thy aim thou art lured on through all manner of hardships and there is an end to thy peace of mind art fain to lead a life of pleasure yet who does not scorn and contemn one who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of things the body again on how slight and perishable a possession do they rely who set before themselves bodily excellences can ye ever surpass the elephant in bulk or the bull in strength can ye excel the tiger in swiftness look upon the infinitude the solidity the swift motion of the heavens and for once cease to admire things mean and worthless and yet the heavens are not so much to be admired on this account as for the reason which guides them then how transient is the lustre of beauty how soon gone more fleeting than the fading bloom of spring flowers and yet if as aristotle says men should see with the eyes of lynceus so that their sight might pierce through obstructions would not that body of alcibiades so gloriously fair in outward seeming appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open to the view therefore it is not thy own nature that makes thee seem beautiful but the weakness of the eyes that see thee yet prize as unduly as ye will that body excellences so long as ye know that this that ye admire whatever its worth can be dissolved away by the feeble flame of a three days fever from all which considerations we may conclude as a whole that these things which cannot make good the advantages they promise which are never made perfect by the assemblage of all good things these neither lead as byays to happiness nor themselves make men completely happy song human folly alas how wide astray doth ignorance these wretched mortals lead from truth own way for not on leafy stems do ye within the green wood look for gold nor strip the vine for gems your nets ye do not spread upon the hillops that the groaning board with fish be furnish if ye are fain to chase the bounding goat ye sweep not in vain search the ocean ruffled face the sea far depths they know each hidden nook wherein the waves orwash the pearl as white as snow where lurks the tyrian shell where fish and prickly urchins do abound all this they know full well but not to know or care where hidden lies the good all hearts desire this blindness they can bear with gaze on earth lowent they seek for that which reacheth far beyond the starry firmament what curse shall i call down on hearts so dull may they the race still run for wealth and high renown and when with much ado the false good they have grasped ah then too late may they discern the true his much may well suffice to set forth the form of false happiness if this is now clear to thine eyes the next step is to show what true happiness is ndeed said i see clearly enough that neither is independence to be found in wealth nor power in sovereignty nor reverence in dignities nor fame in glory nor true joy in pleasures ast thou discerned also the causes why this is so seem to have some inkling but i should like to learn more at large from thee hy truly the reason is hard at hand that which is simple and indivisible by nature human error separates and transforms from the true and perfect to the false and imperfect dost thou imagine that which lacketh nothing can want power ertainly not ight for if there is any feebleness of strength in anything in this there must necessarily be need of external protection hat is so the nature of independence and power is one and the same t seems so ell but dost think that anything of such a nature as this can be looked upon with contempt or is it rather of all things most worthy of veneration ay there can be no doubt as to that et us then add reverence to independence and power and conclude these three to be one e must if we will acknowledge the truth hinkest thou then this combination of qualities to be obscure and without distinction or rather famous in all renown just consider can that want renown which has been agreed to be lacking in nothing to be supreme in power and right worthy of honour for the reason that it cannot bestow this upon itself and so comes to appear somewhat poor in esteem cannot but acknowledge that being what it is this union of qualities is also right famous t follows then that we must admit that renown is not different from the other three t does said i hat then which needs nothing outside itself which can accomplish all things in its own strength which enjoys fame and compels reverence must not this evidently be also fully crowned with joy n sooth i cannot conceive said i ow any sadness can find entrance into such a state wherefore i must needs acknowledge it full of joy at least if our former conclusions are to hold hen for the same reasons this also is necessary that independence power renown reverence and sweetness of delight are different only in name but in substance differ no wise one from the other t is said i his then which is one and simple by nature human perversity separates and in trying to win a part of that which has no parts fails to attain not only that portion since there are no portion but also the whole to which it does not dream of aspiring ow so said i e who to escape want seeks riches gives himself no concern about power he prefers a mean and low estate and also denies himself many pleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which he has gained but at this rate he does not even attain to independence a weakling void of strength vexed by distresses mean and despised and buried in obscurity he again who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth despises pleasure and thinks fame and rank alike worthless without power but thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective sometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries that he is gnawed by anxieties and since he cannot rid himself of these inconveniences even ceases to have that power which was his whole end and aim in like manner may we cast up the reckoning in case of rank of glory or of pleasure for since each one of these severally is identical with the rest whosoever seeks any one of them without the others does not even lay hold of that one which he makes his aim ell said i hat then uppose anyone desire to obtain them together he does indeed wish for happiness as a whole but will he find it in these things which as we have proved are unable to bestow what they promise ay by no means said i hen happiness must certainly not be sought in these things which severally are believed to afford some one of the blessings most to be desired hey must not i admit no conclusion could be more true o then the form and the causes of false happiness are set before thine eyes now turn thy gaze to the other side there thou wilt straightway see the true happiness i promised ea indeed is plain to the blind said i hou didst point it out even now in seeking to unfold the causes of the false for unless i am mistaken that is true and perfect happiness which crowns one with the union of independence power reverence renown and joy and to prove to thee with how deep an insight i have listened since all these are the same that which can truly bestow one of them i know to be without doubt full and complete happiness appy art thou my scholar in this thy conviction only one thing shouldst thou add hat is that said i s there aught thinkest thou amid these mortal and perishable things which can produce a state such as this ay surely not and this thou hast so amply demonstrated that no word more is needed ell then these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the true good or some kind of imperfect good but the true and perfect good they cannot bestow ven so said i ince then thou hast learnt what that true happiness is and what men falsely call happiness it now remains that thou shouldst learn from what source to seek this es to this i have long been eagerly looking forward ell since as plato maintains in the tim us we ought even in the most trivial matters to implore the divine protection what thinkest thou should we now do in order to deserve to find the seat of that highest good e must invoke the father of all things said i or without this no enterprise sets out from a right beginning hou sayest well said she and forthwith lifted up her voice and sang song invocation maker of earth and sky from age to age who rult the world by reason at whose word time issues from eternity abyss to all that moves the source of movement fixed thyself and moveless thee no cause impelled extrinsic this proportioned frame to shape from shapeless matter but deepet within thy inmost being the form of perfect good from envy free and thou didst mould the whole to that supernal pattern beauteous the world in thee thus imaged being thyself most beautiful so thou the work didst fashion in that fair likeness bidding it put on perfection through the exquisite perfectness of every part contrivance thou dost bind the elements in balanced harmony so that the hot and cold the moist and dry contend not nor the pure fire leaping up escape or weight of waters whelm the earth thou joinest and diffusest through the whole linking accordantly its several parts a soul of threefold nature moving all this cleft in twain and in two circles gathered speeds in a path that on itself returns encompassing mind limits and conforms the heavens to her true semblance lesser souls and lesser lives by a like ordinance thou sendest forth each to its starry car affixing and dost strew them far and wide or earth and heaven these by a law benign thou biddest turn again and render back to thee their fires oh grant almighty father grant us on reason wing to soar aloft to heaven exalted height grant us to see the fount of good grant us the true light found to fix our steadfast eyes in vision clear on thee disperse the heavy mists of earth and shine in thine own splendour for thou art the true serenity and perfect rest of every pious soul to see thy face the end and the beginning one the guide the traveller the pathway and the goal ince now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good and what the form of the perfect also methinks i should next show in what manner this perfection of felicity is built up and here i conceive it proper to inquire first whether any excellence such as thou hast lately defined can exist in the nature of things lest we be deceived by an empty fiction of thought to which no true reality answers but it cannot be denied that such does exist and is as it were the source of all things good for everything which is called imperfect is spoken of as imperfect by reason of the privation of some perfection so it comes to pass that whenever imperfection is found in any particular there must necessarily be a perfection in respect of that particular also for were there no such perfection it is utterly inconceivable how that soalled imperfection should come into existence nature does not make a beginning with things mutilated and imperfect she starts with what is whole and perfect and falls away later to these feeble and inferior productions so if there is as we showed before a happiness of a frail and imperfect kind it cannot be doubted but there is also a happiness substantial and perfect ost true is thy conclusion and most sure said i ext to consider where the dwellinglace of this happiness may be the common belief of all mankind agrees that god the supreme of all things is good for since nothing can be imagined better than god how can we doubt him to be good than whom there is nothing better now reason shows god to be good in such wise as to prove that in him is perfect good for were it not so he would not be supreme of all things for there would be something else more excellent possessed of perfect good which would seem to have the advantage in priority and dignity since it has clearly appeared that all perfect things are prior to those less complete wherefore lest we fall into an infinite regression we must acknowledge the supreme god to be full of supreme and perfect good but we have determined that true happiness is the perfect good therefore true happiness must dwell in the supreme deity accept thy reasonings said i hey cannot in any wise be disputed ut come see how strictly and incontrovertibly thou mayst prove this our assertion that the supreme godhead hath fullest possession of the highest good n what way pray said i o not rashly suppose that he who is the father of all things hath received that highest good of which he is said to be possessed either from some external source or hath it as a natural endowment in such sort that thou mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed and of the god who possesses it distinct and different for if thou deemest it received from without thou mayst esteem that which gives more excellent than that which has received but him we most worthily acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all things if however it is in him by nature yet is logically distinct the thought is inconceivable since we are speaking of god who is supreme of all things who was there to join these distinct essences finally when one thing is different from another the things so conceived as distinct cannot be identical therefore that which of its own nature is distinct from the highest good is not itself the highest good an impious thought of him than whom is plain nothing can be more excellent for universally nothing can be better in nature than the source from which it has come therefore on most true grounds of reason would i conclude that which is the source of all things to be in its own essence the highest good nd most justly said i ut the highest good has been admitted to be happiness es hen said she t is necessary to acknowledge that god is very happiness es said i cannot gainsay my former admissions and i see clearly that this is a necessary inference therefrom eflect also said she hether the same conclusion is not further confirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme goods distinct one from the other for the goods which are different clearly cannot be severally each what the other is wherefore neither of the two can be perfect since to either the other is wanting but since it is not perfect it cannot manifestly be the supreme good by no means then can goods which are supreme be different one from the other but we have concluded that both happiness and god are the supreme good wherefore that which is highest divinity must also itself necessarily be supreme happiness o conclusion said i ould be truer to fact nor more soundly reasoned out nor more worthy of god hen further said she ust as geometricians are wont to draw inferences from their demonstrations to which they give the name deductions so will i add here a sort of corollary for since men become happy by the acquisition of happiness while happiness is very godship it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of godship but as by the acquisition of justice men become just and wise by the acquisition of wisdom so by parity of reasoning by acquiring godship they must of necessity become gods so every man who is happy is a god and though in nature god is one only yet there is nothing to hinder that very many should be gods by participation in that nature fair conclusion and a precious said i eduction or corollary by whichever name thou wilt call it nd yet said she ot one whit fairer than this which reason persuades us to add hy what said i hy seeing happiness has many particulars included under it should all these be regarded as forming one body of happiness as it were made up of various parts or is there some one of them which forms the full essence of happiness while all the rest are relative to this would thou wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large e judge happiness to be good do we not ea the supreme good nd this superlative applies to all for this same happiness is adjudged to be the completest independence the highest power reverence renown and pleasure hat then re all these goods independence power and the rest to be deemed members of happiness as it were or are they all relative to good as to their summit and crown understand the problem but i desire to hear how thou wouldst solve it ell then listen to the determination of the matter were all these members composing happiness they would differ severally one from the other for this is the nature of parts that by their difference they compose one body all these however have been proved to be the same therefore they cannot possibly be members otherwise happiness will seem to be built up out of one member which cannot be here can be no doubt as to that said i ut i am impatient to hear what remains hy it is manifest that all the others are relative to the good for the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good and so power also because it is believed to be good the same too may be supposed of reverence of renown and of pleasant delight good then is the sum and source of all desirable things that which has not in itself any good either in reality or in semblance can in no wise be desired contrariwise even things which by nature are not good are desired as if they were truly good if they seem to be so whereby it comes to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge and cause of all things desirable now that for the sake of which anything is desired itself seems to be most wished for for instance if anyone wishes to ride for the sake of health he does not so much wish for the exercise of riding as the benefit of his health since then all things are sought for the sake of the good it is not these so much as good itself that is sought by all but that on account of which all other things are wished for was we agreed happiness wherefore thus also it appears that it is happiness alone which is sought from all which it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute good and of happiness is one and the same cannot see how anyone can dissent from these conclusions ut we have also proved that god and true happiness are one and the same es said i hen we can safely conclude also that god essence is seated in absolute good and nowhere else song the true light hither come all ye whose minds lust with rosy fetters binds lust to bondage hard compelling th earthy souls that are his dwelling here shall be your labour close here your haven of repose come to your one refuge press wide it stands to all distress not the glint of yellow gold down bright hermus current rolled not the tagus precious sands nor in farff scorching lands all the radiant gems that hide under indus storied tide emerald green and glistering white can illume our feeble sight but they rather leave the mind in its native darkness blind for the fairest beams they shed in earth lowest depths were fed but the splendour that supplies strength and vigour to the skies and the universe controls shunneth dark and ruined souls he who once hath seen this light will not call the sunbeam bright quite agree said i ruly all thy reasonings hold admirably together then said she hat value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou come to the knowledge of the absolute good h an infinite said i f only i were so blest as to learn to know god also who is the good et this will i make clear to thee on truest grounds of reason if only our recent conclusions stand fast hey will ave we not shown that those things which most men desire are not true and perfect good precisely for this cause that they differ severally one from another and seeing that one is wanting to another they cannot bestow full and absolute good but that they become the true good when they are gathered as it were into one form and agency so that that which is independence is likewise power reverence renown and pleasant delight and unless they are all one and the same they have no claim to be counted among things desirable es this was clearly proved and cannot in any wise be doubted ow when things are far from being good while they are different but become good as soon as they are one is it not true that these become good by acquiring unity t seems so said i ut dost not thou allow that all which is good is good by participation in goodness t is hen thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are the same for when the effects of things in their natural working differ not their essence is one and the same here is no denying it ow dost thou know said she hat all which is abides and subsists so long as it continues one but so soon as it ceases to be one it perishes and falls to pieces n what way hy take animals for example when soul and body come together and continue in one this is we say a living creature but when this unity is broken by the separation of these two the creature dies and is clearly no longer living the body also while it remains in one form by the joining together of its members presents a human appearance but if the separation and dispersal of the parts break up the body unity it ceases to be what it was and if we extend our survey to all other things without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing subsists while it is one but when it ceases to be one perishes es when i consider further i see it to be even as thou sayest ell is there aught said she hich in so far as it acts conformably to nature abandons the wish for life and desires to come to death and corruption to living creatures which have some faults of choice i find none that without external compulsion forego the will to live and of their own accord hasten to destruction for every creature diligently pursues the end of selfreservation and shuns death and destruction as to herbs and trees and inanimate things generally i am altogether in doubt what to think nd yet there is no possibility of question about this either since thou seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them where as far as their nature admits they cannot quickly wither and die some spring up in the plains others in the mountains some grow in marshes others cling to rocks and others again find a fertile soil in the barren sands and if you try to transplant these elsewhere they wither away nature gives to each the soil that suits it and uses her diligence to prevent any of them dying so long as it is possible for them to continue alive why do they all draw their nourishment from roots as from a mouth dipped into the earth and distribute the strong bark over the pith why are all the softer parts like the pith deeply encased within while the external parts have the strong texture of wood and outside of all is the bark to resist the weather inclemency like a champion stout in endurance again how great is nature diligence to secure universal propagation by multiplying seed who does not know all these to be contrivances not only for the present maintenance of a species but for its lasting continuance generation after generation for ever and do not also the things believed inanimate on like grounds of reason seek each what is proper to itself why do the flames shoot lightly upward while the earth presses downward with its weight if it is not that these motions and situations are suitable to their respective natures moreover each several thing is preserved by that which is agreeable to its nature even as it is destroyed by things inimical things solid like stones resist disintegration by the close adhesion of their parts things fluid like air and water yield easily to what divides them but swiftly flow back and mingle with those parts from which they have been severed while fire again refuses to be cut at all and we are not now treating of the voluntary motions of an intelligent soul but of the drift of nature even so is it that we digest our food without thinking about it and draw our breath unconsciously in sleep nay even in living creatures the love of life cometh not of conscious will but from the principles of nature for oftentimes in the stress of circumstances will chooses the death which nature shrinks from and contrarily in spite of natural appetite will restrains that work of reproduction by which alone the persistence of perishable creatures is maintained so entirely does this love of self come from drift of nature not from animal impulse providence has furnished things with this most cogent reason for continuance they must desire life so long as it is naturally possible for them to continue living wherefore in no way mayst thou doubt but that things naturally aim at
