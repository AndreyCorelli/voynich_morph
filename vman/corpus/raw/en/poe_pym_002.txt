consequently were at that moment far better than his own or than that either of peters or augustus in short that i was in a condition to have my own way by force if i found it necessary and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and cannibal designs i would not hesitate to throw him into the sea upon this he immediately seized me by the throat and drawing a knife made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach an atrocity which his excessive debility alone prevented him from accomplishing in the mean time being roused to a high pitch of anger i forced him to the vessel side with the full intention of throwing him overboard he was saved from this fate however by the interference of peters who now approached and separated us asking the cause of the disturbance this parker told before i could find means in any manner to prevent him the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had anticipated both augustus and peters who it seems had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been merely the first to broach joined with him in his design and insisted upon its being immediately carried into effect i had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose and with the aid of either one of them i had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment being disappointed in this expectation it became absolutely necessary that i should attend to my own safety as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i knew would speedily be enacted i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal merely requesting a delay of about one hour in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to wait thus long and as i had anticipated a breeze rapidly coming i the fog lifted before the hour had expired when no vessel appearing in sight we prepared to draw lots it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued a scene which with its minutest details no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory and whose stern recollection will imbitter every future moment of my existence let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit the only method we could devise for the terrific lottery in which we were to take each a chance was that of drawing straws small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose and it was agreed that i should be the holder i retired to one end of the hulk while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned towards me the bitterest anxiety which i endured at any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots there are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held but now that the silent definite and stern nature of the business in which i was engaged so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famin allowed me to reflect on the few chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deaths death for the most appalling of purposes very particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror i could not at first even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood my fingers absolutely refusing their office and my knees knocking violently against each other my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation i thought of falling on my knees to my companions and entreating them to let me escape this necessity of suddenly rushing upon them and by putting one of them to death of rendering the decision by lot useless n short of everything but of going through with the matter i had in hand at last after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct i was recalled to my senses by the voice of parker who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring even then i could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot but thought over every species of finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellowufferers to draw the short straw as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own at length delay was no longer possible and with a heart almost bursting from my bosom i advanced to the region of the forecastle where my companions were awaiting me i held out my hand with the splinters and peters immediately drew he was free his at least was not the shortest and there was now another chance against my escape i summoned up all my strength and passed the lots to augustus he also drew immediately and he also was free and now whether i should live or die the chances were no more than precisely even at this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom and i felt towards my poor fellowreature parker the most intense the most diabolical hatred but the feeling did not last and at length with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes i held out the two remaining splinters towards him it was full five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw during which period of heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand the decision was then over yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me no one spoke and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter i held peters at length took me by the hand and i forced myself to look up when i immediately saw by the countenance of parker that i was safe and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer gasping for breath i fell senseless to the deck i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about he made no resistance whatever and was stabbed in the back by peters when he fell instantly dead i must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued such things may be imagined but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality let it suffice to say that having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim and having by common consent taken off the hands feet and head throwing them together with the entrails into the sea we devoured the rest of the body piecemeal during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth of the month on the nineteenth there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the gale the quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and hope on the twentyirst we were again reduced to the last necessity the weather still remained warm and pleasant with occasional fogs and light breezes most usually from n to w on the twentyecond as we were sitting close huddled together gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of hope i remembered that when the foremast had been cut away peters being in the windward chains passed one of the axes into my hand requesting me to put it if possible in a place of security and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths i now thought it possible that by getting at this axe we might cut through the deck over the storeroom and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions when i communicated this project to my companions they uttered a feeble shout of joy and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle the difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin the opening being much smaller for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin companionatch had been carried away whereas the forecastleay being a simple hatch of only about three feet square had remained uninjured i did not hesitate however to attempt the descent and a rope being fastened round my body as before i plunged boldly in feet foremost made my way quickly to the berth and at the very first attempt brought up the axe it was hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of rekindled hope peters and myself taking the axe by turns augustus wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting it soon became evident that many long hours would be requisite to accomplish our task hat is to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom this consideration however did not discourage us and working all night by the light of the moon we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twentyhird peters now volunteered to go down and having made all arrangements as before he descended and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar which to our great joy proved to be full of olives having shared these among us and devoured them with the greatest avidity we proceeded to let him down again this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine of the latter we each took a moderate sup having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely the ham except about two pounds near the bone was not in a condition to be eaten having been entirely spoiled by the salt water the sound part was divided among us peters and augustus not being able to restrain their appetite swallowed theirs upon the instant but i was more cautious and ate but a small portion of mine dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue we now rested a while from our labours which had been intolerably severe by noon feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed we again renewed our attempt at getting up provision peters and myself going down alternately and always with more or less success until sundown during this interval we had the good fortune to bring up altogether four more small jars of olives another ham a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape madeira wine and what gave us still more delight a small tortoise of the gallipago breed several of which had been taken on board by captain barnard as the grampus was leaving port from the schooner mary pitts just returned from a sealing voyage in the pacific in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise it is found principally as most of my readers may know in the group of islands called the gallipagos which indeed derive their name from the animal he spanish word gallipago meaning a freshater terapin from the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise they are frequently found of an enormous size i have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds although i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred their appearance is singular and even disgusting their steps are very slow measured and heavy their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground their neck is long and exceedingly slender from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length and i killed one where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches the head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent they can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind eing as fat and in every respect in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in in one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary or camel of the desert in a bag at the root of the neck they carry with them a constant supply of water in some instances upon killing them after a full year deprivation of all nourishment as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags their food is chiefly wild parsley and celery with purslain seaelp and prickly pears upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered they are excellent and highly nutritious food and have no doubt been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whaleishery and other pursuits in the pacific the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size weighing probably sixtyive or seventy pounds it was a female and in excellent condition being exceedingly fat and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag this was indeed a treasure and falling on our knees with one accord we returned fervent thanks to god for so seasonable a relief we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious it was upon the point of making its escape from peters grasp and slipping back into the water when augustus throwing a rope with a slipnot around its throat held it up in this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters and assisted him in lifting it out the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug which it will be remembered had been brought up before from the cabin having done this we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form with the cork a kind of glass holding not quite half a gill we then each drank one of these measures full and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out during the last two or three days the weather having been dry and pleasant the bedding we had obtained from the cabin as well as our clothing had become thoroughly dry so that we passed this night that of the twentyhir in comparative comfort enjoying a tranquil repose after having supped plentifully on olives and ham with a small allowance of the wine being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night in the event of a breeze springing up we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass our tortoise which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could we threw on his back and otherwise carefully fastened chapter july this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed ignorant of our position although certainly at a great distance from land without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care almost entirely without water and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil o strictly comparative is either good or ill at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom when a smart shower coming on with some lightning we turned our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechainlates in the middle of it the water thus conducted to the centre was drained through into our jug we had nearly filled it in this manner when a heavy squall coming on from the northward obliged us to desist as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet we now went forward and lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances at noon the wind had freshened into a twoeef breeze and by night into a stiff gale accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell experience having taught us however the best method of arranging our lashings we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea and in momentary dread of being washed off fortunately the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise july this morning the gale had diminished to a mere tennot breeze and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck to our great grief however we found that two jars of our olives as well as the whole of our ham had been washed overboard in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened we determined not to kill the tortoise as yet and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives and a measure of water each which latter we mixed half and half with wine finding great relief and strength from the mixture without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom several articles of no importance to us in our present situation floated up through the opening during the day and were immediately washed overboard we also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves on this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day at noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator towards evening saw several sharks and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us at one time a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water the monster actually swam in upon us floundering for some moments just over the companionatch and striking peters violently with his tail a heavy sea at length hurled him overboard much to our relief in moderate weather we might have easily captured him july this morning the wind having greatly abated and the sea not being very rough we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom after a great deal of hard labour during the whole day we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter the partitions of the room having been stove during the night and its contents swept into the hold this discovery as may be supposed filled us with despair july the sea nearly smooth with a light wind and still from the northward and westward the sun coming out hotly in the afternoon we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes found great relief from thirst and much comfort otherwise by bathing in the sea in this however we were forced to use great caution being afraid of sharks several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day july good weather still the brig now began to lie along so alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency lashing our tortoise waterug and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward placing them outside the hull below the mainhains the sea very smooth all day with little or no wind july a continuance of the same weather augustus wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification he complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst but no acute pain nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced we did everything in our power for his comfort and trebled his allowance of water july an excessively hot day with no wind an enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon we made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose augustus much worse and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds he constantly prayed to be released from his sufferings wishing for nothing but death this evening we ate the last of our olives and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine determined to kill our tortoise in the morning july after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue owing to the position of the hulk we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed although in good condition he whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds with a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible we cut it into fine pieces and filled with them our three remaining olivears and the wineottle all of which had been kep pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives in this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest we concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day the whole would thus last us thirteen days a brisk shower with severe thunder and lightning came on about dusk but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water the whole of this by common consent was given to augustus who now appeared to be in the last extremity he drank the water from the sheet as we caught it we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mout for we had now nothing left capable of holding water unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the carboy or the stale water from the jug either of these expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught his arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder and his feet were like ice we expected every moment to see him breathe his last he was frightfully emaciated so much so that although he weighed a hundred and twentyeven pounds upon his leaving nantucket he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest his eyes were sunk far in his head being scarcely perceptible and the skin of his cheeks hung so loosely as to prevent his masticating any food or even swallowing any liquid without great difficulty august a continuance of the same calm weather with an oppressively hot sun suffered exceedingly from thirst the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin we contrived nevertheless to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine ur thirst however was but little abated we found more relief by bathing in the sea but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals on account of the continual presence of sharks we now saw clearly that augustus could not be saved that he was evidently dying we could do nothing to relieve his sufferings which appeared to be great about twelve olock he expired in strong convulsions and without having spoken for several hours his death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day and never addressed each other except in a whisper it was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard it was then loathsome beyond expression and so far decayed that as peters attempted to lift it an entire leg came off in his grasp as the mass of putrefaction slipped over the vessel side into the water the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks the clashing of whose horrible teeth as their prey was torn to pieces among them might have been heard at the distance of a mile we shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound august the same fearfully calm and hot weather the dawn found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion the water in the jug was now absolutely useless being a thick gelatinous mass nothing but frightfulooking worms mingled with slime we threw it out and washed the jug well in the sea afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise our thirst could now scarcely be endured and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine which seemed only to add fuel to the flame and excited us to a high degree of intoxication we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with seawater but this instantly brought about the most violent retchings so that we never again attempted it during the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing but to no purpose for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks o doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings we had experienced indescribable relief in bathing and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear nor indeed were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of these voracious fish who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us swimming up to leeward no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters and much wounded he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were a cloud came up at dusk but to our extreme anguish passed over without discharging itself it is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period we passed a sleepless night both on this account and through dread of the sharks august no prospect of relief and the brig lying still more and more along so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all busied ourselves in securing our wine and tortoiseeat so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over got out two stout spikes from the forechains and by means of the axe drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water this not being very far from the keel as we were nearly upon our beamnds to these spikes we now lashed our provisions as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day o chance of bathing on account of the sharks which never left us for a moment found it impossible to sleep august a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was heeling over and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement at first the roll was slow and gradual and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision but we had not calculated sufficiently upon the acceleration of the impetus for presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it and before either of us knew what was to happen we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface with the huge hull immediately above us in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope and finding that i was completely beneath the vessel and my strength utterly exhausted i scarcely made a struggle for life and resigned myself in a few seconds to die but here again i was deceived not having taken into consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward the whirl of the water upward which the vessel occasioned in rolling partially back brought me to the surface still more violently than i had been plunged beneath upon coming up i found myself about twenty yards from the hulk as near as i could judge she was lying keel up rocking furiously from side to side and the sea in all directions around was much agitated and full of strong whirlpools i could see nothing of peters an oilask was floating within a few feet of me and various other articles from the brig were scattered about my principal terror was now on account of the sharks which i knew to be in my vicinity in order to deter these if possible from approaching me i splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk creating a body of foam i have no doubt that to this expedient simple as it was i was indebted for my preservation for the sea all around the brig just before her rolling over was so crowded with these monsters that i must have been and really was in actual contact with some of them during my progress by great good fortune however i reached the side of the vessel in safety although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of peters who now to my great joy made his appearance having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hul and threw me the end of a rope ne of those which had been attached to the spikes having barely escaped this danger our attention was now directed to the dreadful imminency of another that of absolute starvation our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more we gave way both of us to despair weeping aloud like children and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other such weakness can scarcely be conceived and to those who have never been similarly situated will no doubt appear unnatural but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected that we could not justly be considered at that period in the light of rational beings in subsequent perils nearly as great if not greater i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation and peters it will be seen evinced a stoical philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike supineness and imbecility he mental condition made the difference the overturning of the brig even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle would not in fact have rendered our situation more deplorable than before except for the disappearance of the bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch rainwater and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught for we found the whole bottom from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel together with the keel itself thickly covered with large barnacles which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food thus in two important respects the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved a benefit rather than an injury it had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted using it moderately in a month and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position we being much more at our ease and in infinitely less danger than before the difficulty however of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition that we might be ready to avail ourselves as far as possible of any shower which might fall we took off our shirts to make use of them as we had of the sheets ot hoping of course to get more in this way even under the most favourable circumstances than half a gill at a time no signs of a cloud appeared during the day and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable at night peters obtained about an hour disturbed sleep but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment august toay a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs which afforded us several delicious meals their shells being quite soft we ate them entire and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed we also ventured to bathe and remained in the water for four or five hours during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst were greatly refreshed and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before both of us snatching a little sleep august this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain lasting from about noon until after dark bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and carboy for in spite of the little means we had of catching the water we might have filled one if not both of them as it was we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths in this occupation we passed the entire day august just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward and evidently coming towards us we hailed the glorious sight with a long although feeble shout of rapture and began instantly to make every signal in our power by flaring the shirts in the air leaping as high as our weak condition would permit and even by hallooing with all the strength of our lungs although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant however she still continued to near our hulk and we felt that if she but held her present course she must eventually come so close as to perceive us in about an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see the people on her decks she was a long low and rakishooking topsail schooner with a black ball in her foretopsail and had apparently a full crew we now became alarmed for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were n act of fiendish barbarity which however incredible it may appear has been repeatedly perpetrated at sea under circumstances very nearly similar and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species in this instance however by the mercy of god we were destined to be most happily deceived for presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger who immediately afterward run up a british flag and hauling her wind bore up directly upon us in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin she proved to be the jane guy of liverpool captain guy bound on a sealing and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific footnote the case of the brig polly of boston is one so much in point and her fate in many respects so remarkably similar to our own that i cannot forbear alluding to it here this vessel of one hundred and thirty tons burden sailed from boston with a cargo of lumber and provisions for santa croix on the twelfth of december under the command of captain casneau there were eight souls on board besides the captain he mate four seamen and the cook together with a mr hunt and a negro girl belonging to him on the fifteenth having cleared the shoal of georges she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast and was finally capsized but the mast going by the board she afterward righted they remained in this situation without fire and with very little provision for the period of one hundred and ninetyne days from december the fifteenth to june the twentiet when captain casneau and samuel badger the only survivers were taken off the wreck by the fame of hull captain featherstone bound home from rio janeiro when picked up they were in latitude n longitude w having drifted above two thousand miles on the ninth of july the fame fell in with the brig dromeo captain perkins who landed the two sufferers in kennebeck the narrative from which we gather these details ends in the following words it is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance upon the most frequented part of the atlantic and not be discovered all this time they were passed by more than a dozen sail one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them but to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men they stifled the dictates of compassion hoisted sail and cruelly abandoned them to their fate chapter the jane guy was a fineooking topsail schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden she was unusually sharp in the bows and on a wind in moderate weather the fastest sailer i have ever seen her qualities however as a rough seaoat were not so good and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined for this peculiar service a larger vessel and one of a light proportionate draught is desirable ay a vessel of from three to three hundred and fifty tons she should be barqueigged and in other respects of a different construction from the usual south sea ships it is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed she should have say ten or twelve twelve pound carronades and two or three long twelves with brass blunderbusses and wateright armhests for each top her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade and above all her crew should be numerous and efficient ot less for such a vessel as i have described than fifty or sixty ableodied men the jane guy had a crew of thirtyive all able seamen besides the captain and mate but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired captain guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner and of considerable experience in the southern traffic to which he had devoted a great portion of his life he was deficient however in energy and consequently in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite he was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed and was invested with discretionary powers to cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand he had on board as usual in such voyages beads lookinglasses tinderorks axes hatchets saws adzes planes chisels gouges gimlets files spokeshaves rasps hammers nails knives scissors razors needles thread crockeryare calico trinkets and other similar articles the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july crossed the tropic of cancer on the twentyifth in longitude twenty degrees west and reached sal one of the cape verd islands on the twentyinth where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage on the third of august she left the cape verds and steered southwest stretching over towards the coast of brazil so as to cross the equator between the meridians of twentyight and thirty degrees west longitude this is the course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of good hope or by that route to the east indies by proceeding thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of guinea while in the end it is found to be the shortest track as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the cape it was captain guy intention to make his first stoppage at kerguelen land hardly know for what reason on the day we were picked up the schooner was off cape st roque in longitude w so that when found we had drifted probably from north to south not less than fivendwenty degrees on board the jane guy we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded in about a fortnight during which time we continued steering to the southeast with gentle breezes and fine weather both peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful suffering and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality i have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to joy he degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange thus in my own case i now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i endured during the days spent upon the hulk the incidents are remembered but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence i only know that when they did occur i then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with whalinghips and more frequently with the black or right whale so called in contradistinction to the spermaceti these however were chiefly found south of the twentyifth parallel on the sixteenth of september being in the vicinity of the cape of good hope the schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving liverpool in this neighbourhood but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory we were to the westwar navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward which rage with great fury they always bring with them a heavy sea and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the gale a perfect hurricane will be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast and in the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable a bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall and as usual from the northward by eight it had increased very much and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas i had then ever beheld everything had been made as snug as possible but the schooner laboured excessively and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the lookout made its appearance in the southwest and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast in two minutes more in spite of every preparation we were hurled on our beamnds as if by magic and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay the blow from the southwest however luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar a heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this but towards morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale captain guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of prince edward island in latitude s longitude e two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island and presently passed the islands of crozet in latitude s longitude e on the eighteenth we made kerguelen or desolation island in the southern indian ocean and came to anchor in christmas harbour having four fathoms of water this island or rather group of islands bears southeast from the cape of good hope and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues it was first discovered in by the baron de kergulen or kerguelen a frenchman who thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home information to that effect which produced much excitement at the time the government taking the matter up sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination when the mistake was discovered in captain cook fell in with the same group and gave to the principal one the name of desolation island a title which it certainly well deserves upon approaching the land however the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise as the sides of most of the hills from september to march are clothed with very brilliant verdure this deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling saxifrage which is abundant growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbour some lichen and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed and which has a bitter and acrid taste the face of the country is hilly although none of the hills can be called lofty their tops are perpetually covered with snow there are several harbours of which christmas harbour is the most convenient it is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing cape fran ois which forms the northern shore and by its peculiar shape serves to distinguish the harbour its projecting point terminates in a high rock through which is a large hole forming a natural arch the entrance is in latitude s longitude e passing in here good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds proceeding on eastwardly from this anchorage you come to wasp bay at the head of the harbour this is a small basin completely landlocked into which you can go with four fathoms and find anchorage in from ten to three hard clay bottom a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk to the westward at the head of wasp bay is a small stream of excellent water easily procured some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on kerguelen island and sea elephants abound the feathered tribes are discovered in great numbers penguins are very plenty and of these there are four different kinds the royal penguin so called from its size and beautiful plumage is the largest the upper part of the body is usually gray sometimes of a lilach tint the under portion of the purest white imaginable the head is of a glossy and most brilliant black the feet also the chief beauty of the plumage however consists in two broad stripes of a gold colour which pass along from the head to the breast the bill is long and either pink or bright scarlet these birds walk erect with a stately carriage they carry their heads high with their wings drooping like two arms and as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs the resemblance to a human figure is very striking and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening the royal penguins which we met with on kerguelen land were rather larger than a goose the other kinds are the macaroni the jackass and the rookery penguin these are much smaller less beautiful in plumage and different in other respects besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found among which may be mentioned seahens blue peterels teal ducks port egmont hens shags cape pigeons the nelly seaswallows terns seagulls mother carey chickens mother carey geese or the great peterel and lastly the albatross the great peterel is as large as the common albatross and is carnivorous it is frequently called the breakones or osprey peterel they are not at all shy and when properly cooked are palatable food in flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water with the wings expanded without appearing to move them in the least degree or make any exertion with them whatever the albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the south sea birds it is of the gull species and takes its prey on the wing never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species hat of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four penguins navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments a rookery these rookeries have been often described but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross it will not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living when the season for incubation arrives the birds assemble in vast numbers and for some days appear to be deliberating upon the proper course to be pursued at length they proceed to action a level piece of ground is selected of suitable extent usually comprising three or four acres and situated as near the sea as possible being still beyond its reach the spot is chosen with reference to its evenness of surface and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones this matter being arranged the birds proceed with one accord and actuated apparently by one mind to trace out with mathematical accuracy either a square or other parallelogram as may best suit the nature of the ground and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled and no more n this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labour of the encampment one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water edge and is left open for ingress or egress having defined the limits of the rookery the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish picking up stone by stone and carrying them outside of the lines and close by them so as to form a wall on the three inland sides just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed from six to eight feet wide and extending around the encampment hus serving the purpose of a general promenade the next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size this is done by forming narrow paths very smooth and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the rookery at each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed and a penguin nest in the centre of each square hus every penguin is surrounded by four albatrosses and each albatross by a like number of penguins the penguin nest consists of a hole in the earth very shallow being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling the albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter this is made of earth seaweed and shells on its summit she builds her nest the birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation or indeed until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves while the male is absent at sea in search of food the female remains on duty and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad the eggs are never left uncovered at all hile one bird leaves the nest the other nestling in by its side this precaution is rendered necessary by the thievish propensities prevalent in the rookery the inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other eggs at every good opportunity although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with enjoying all the privileges of citizenship and scattering their nests here and there wherever they can find room never interfering however with the stations of the larger species the appearance of such encampments when seen from a distance is exceedingly singular the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross mingled with the smaller tribe which are continually hovering over it either going to the ocean or returning home at the same time a crowd of penguins are to be observed some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them around the general promenaderound which encircles the rookery in short survey it as we will nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection in every wellegulated human intellect on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief mate mr patterson took the boats and although it was somewhat early in the seaso went in search of seal leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward they having some business whose nature i could not ascertain to transact in the interior of the island captain guy took with him a bottle in which was a sealed letter and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore towards one of the highest peaks in the place it is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him as soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded peters and myself being in the mate boa on our cruise around the coast looking for seal in this business we were occupied about three weeks examining with great care every nook and corner not only of kerguelen land but of the several small islands in the vicinity our labours however were not crowned with any important success we saw a great many fur seal but they were exceedingly shy and with the greatest exertions we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all sea elephants were abundant especially on the western coast of the main island but of these we killed only twenty and this with great difficulty on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal but did not molest them we returned to the schooner on the eleventh where we found captain guy and his nephew who gave a very bad account of the interior representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world they had remained two nights on the island owing to some misunderstanding on the part of the second mate in regard to the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off chapter on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour retracing our way to the westward and leaving marion island one of crozet group on the larboard we afterward passed prince edward island leaving it also on our left then steering more to the northward made in fifteen days the islands of tristan dcunha in latitude s longitude w this group now so well known and which consists of three circular islands was first discovered by the portuguese and was visited afterward by the dutch in and by the french in the three islands together form a triangle and are distant from each other about ten miles there being fine open passages between the land in all of them is very high especially in tristan dcunha properly so called this is the largest of the group being fifteen miles in circumference and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles a part of the land towards the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea a tableland at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island and from this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe the lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size but the upper region is barren rock usually hidden among the clouds and covered with snow during the greater part of the year there are no shoals or other dangers about the island the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep on the northwestern coast is a bay with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can be easily effected provided there be a southerly wind plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line the next island in point of size and the most westwardly of the group is that called the inaccessible its precise situation is s latitude longitude w it is seven or eight miles in circumference and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect its top is perfectly flat and the whole region is steril nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs nightingale island the smallest and most southerly is in latitude s longitude w off its southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast the ground is irregular and steril and a deep valley partially separates it the shores of these islands abound in the proper season with sea lions sea elephants the hair and fur seal together with a great variety of oceanic birds whales are also plenty in their vicinity owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken the group has been much visited since its discovery the dutch and french frequented it at a very early period in captain patten of the ship industry of philadelphia made tristan dcunha where he remained seven months from august to april for the purpose of collecting sealskins in this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds with the exception of a few wild goats he island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals which have been introduced by subsequent navigators i believe it was not long after captain patten visit that captain colquhoun of the american brig betsey touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment he planted onions potatoes cabbages and a great many other vegetables an abundance of all which are now to be met with in a captain heywood in the nereus visited tristan he found there three americans who were residing upon the islands to prepare sealskins and oil one of these men was named jonathan lambert and he called himself the sovereign of the country he had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land and turned his attention to raising the coffeelant and sugarane with which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio janeiro this settlement however was finally abandoned and in the islands were taken possession of by the british government who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape of good hope they did not however retain them long but upon the evacuation of the country as a british possession two or three english families took up their residence there independently of the government on the twentyifth of march the berwick captain jeffrey from london to van diemen land arrived at the place where they found an englishman of the name of glass formerly a corporal in the british artillery he claimed to be supreme governor of the islands and had under his control twentyne men and three women he gave a very favourable account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil the population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil with which they traded to the cape of good hope glass owning a small schooner at the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident but his little community had multiplied there being fiftyix persons upon tristan besides a smaller settlement of seven on nightingale island we had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required heep hogs bullocks rabbits poultry goats fish in great variety and vegetables were abundant having come to anchor close in with the large island in eighteen fathoms we took all we wanted on board very conveniently captain guy also purchased of glass five hundred sealskins and some ivory we remained here a week during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward and the weather somewhat hazy on the fifth of november we made sail to the southward and westward with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the auroras respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed these islands are said to have been discovered as early as by the commander of the ship aurora in captain manuel de oyarvido in the ship princess belonging to the royal philippine company sailed as he asserts directly among them in the spanish corvette atrevida went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation and in a paper published by the royal hydrographical society of madrid in the year the following language is used respecting this expedition the corvette atrevida practised in their immediate vicinity from the twentyirst to the twentyeventh of january all the necessary observations and measured by chronometers the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of soledad in the malninas the islands are three they are very nearly in the same meridian the centre one is rather low and the other two may be seen at nine leagues distance the observations made on board the atrevida give the following results as the precise situation of each island the most northern is in latitude s longitude w the middle one in latitude s longitude w and the most southern in latitude s longitude w on the twentyeventh of january captain james weddel of the british navy sailed from staten land also in search of the auroras he reports that having made the most diligent search and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the atrevida but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots he could discover no indication of land these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands and strange to say while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them and even been close in with their shores it was captain guy intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute footnote among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the auroras may be mentioned the ship san miguel in the ship aurora in the brig pearl in and the ship dolores in they all agree in giving the mean latitude fiftyhree degrees south we kept on our course between the south and west with variable weather until the twentieth of the month when we found ourselves on the debated ground being in latitude s longitude w hat is to say very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group not perceiving any sign of land we continued to the westward in the parallel of fiftyhree degrees south as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west we then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fiftywo degrees south when we turned to the eastward and kept our parallel by double altitudes morning and evening and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast of georgia we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out we then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair with no haze whatsoever of course we were thoroughly satisfied that whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period no vestige of them remained at the present day since my return home i find that the same ground was traced over with equal care in by captain johnson of the american schooner henry and by captain morrell in the american schooner wasp n both cases with the same result as in our own chapter it had been captain guy original intention after satisfying himself about the auroras to proceed through the strait of magellan and up along the western coast of patagonia but information received at tristan dcunha induced him to steer to the southward in the hope of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of s longitude w in the event of his not discovering these lands he designed should the season prove favourable to push on towards the pole accordingly on the twelfth of december we made sail in that direction on the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by glass and cruised for three days in that neighbourhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned on the twentyirst the weather being unusually pleasant we again made sail to the southward with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible before entering upon this portion of my narrative it may be as well for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct account in he sailed to the south in the resolution accompanied by lieutenant furneaux in the adventure in december he found himself as far as the fiftyighth parallel of south latitude and in longitude e here he met with narrow fields of ice about eight or ten inches thick and running northwest and southeast this ice was in large cakes and usually it was packed so closely that the vessels had great difficulty in forcing a passage at this period captain cook supposed from the vast number of birds to be seen and from other indications that he was in the near vicinity of land he kept on to the southward the weather being exceedingly cold until he reached the sixtyourth parallel in longitude e here he had mild weather with gentle breezes for five days the thermometer being at thirtyix in january the vessels crossed the antarctic circle but did not succeed in penetrating much farther for upon reaching latitude they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach this ice was of every variety nd some large floes of it miles in extent formed a compact mass rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water it being late in the season and no hope entertained of rounding these obstructions captain cook now reluctantly turned to the northward in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic in latitude he met with a strong current setting to the southward in december when the vessels were in latitude longitude w the cold was excessive with heavy gales and fog here also birds were abundant the albatross the penguin and the peterel especially in latitude some large islands of ice were encountered and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness indicating the vicinity of field ice in latitude longitude w the navigators were stopped as before by an immense frozen expanse which filled the whole area of the southern horizon the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassable and extending about a mile to the southward behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance until terminated in the extreme backround by gigantic ranges of ice mountains the one towering above the other captain cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent mr j n reynolds whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition partly for the purpose of exploring these regions thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution we are not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of west longitude palmer land lies south of the shetland latitude sixtyour degrees and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice which we apprehend must always be the case in that point and so early in the season as the sixth of january nd we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of palmer land or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward in captains kreutzenstern and lisiausky were despatched by alexander of russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the globe in endeavouring to get south they made no farther than in longitude w they here met with strong currents setting eastwardly whales were abundant but they saw no ice in regard to this voyage mr reynolds observes that if kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the season he must have encountered ice t was march when he reached the latitude specified the winds prevailing as they do from the southward and westward had carried the floes aided by currents into that icy region bounded on the north by georgia east by sandwich land and the south orkneys and west by the south shetland islands in captain james weddell of the british navy with two very small vessels penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator and this too without encountering extraordinary difficulties he states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventyecond parallel yet upon attaining it not a particle was to be discovered and that upon arriving at the latitude of no fields and only three islands of ice were visible it is somewhat remarkable that although vast flocks of birds were seen and other usual indications of land and although south of the shetlands unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending southwardly weddell discourages the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south on the eleventh of january captain benjamin morrell of the american schooner wasp sailed from kerguelen land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible on the first of february he found himself in latitude s longitude e the following passage is extracted from his journal of that date the wind soon freshened to an elevennot breeze and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixtyour degrees the less ice was to be apprehended we steered a little to the southward until we crossed the antarctic circle and were in latitude e in this latitude there was no field ice and very few ice islands in sight under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry the sea was now entirely free of field ice and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight at the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher more mil than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixtywo south we were now in latitude s and the temperature of the air was fortyeven and that of the water fortyour in this situation i found the variation to be easterly per azimuth i have several times passed within the antarctic circle on different meridians and have uniformly found the temperature both of the air and the water to become more and more mild the farther i advanced beyond the sixtyifth degree of south latitude and that the variation decreases in the same proportion while north of this latitude say between sixty and sixtyive south we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands some of which were from one to two miles in circumference and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water being nearly destitute of fuel and water and without proper instruments it being also late in the season captain morrell was now obliged to put back without attempting any farther progress to the southward although an entirely open sea lay before him he expresses the opinion that had not these overruling considerations obliged him to retreat he could have penetrated if not to the pole itself at least to the eightyifth parallel i have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience in captain briscoe in the employ of the messieurs enderby whalehip owners of london sailed in the brig lively for the south seas accompanied by the cutter tula on the twentyighth of february being in latitude s longitude e he descried land and clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e s e he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues owing to the boisterous state of the weather finding it impossible to make farther discovery during this season he returned northward to winter in van diemen land in the beginning of he again proceeded southwardly and on the fourth of february land was seen to the southeast in latitude longitude w this was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered on the twentyirst of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter and took possession of it in the name of william calling it adelaide island in honour of the english queen these particulars being made known to the royal geographical society of london the conclusion was drawn by that body that there is a continuous tract of land extending from e to w longitude running the parallel of from sixtyix to sixtyeven degrees south latitude in respect to this conclusion mr reynolds observes in the correctness of it we by no means concur nor do the discoveries of briscoe warrant any such inference it was within these limits that weddell proceeded south on a meridian to the east of georgia sandwich land and the south orkney and shetland islands my own experience will be found to testify most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the society these are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude and it will now be seen that there remained previous to the voyage of the jane nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle had not been crossed at all of course a wide field lay before us for discovery and it was with feelings of most intense interest that i heard captain guy express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward chapter we kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the search for glass islands without meeting with any ice at all on the twentyixth at noon we were in latitude s longitude w we now saw several large ice islands and a floe of field ice not however of any great extent the winds generally blew from the southeast or the northeast but were very light whenever we had a westerly wind which was seldom it was invariably attended with a rain squall every day we had more or less snow the thermometer on the twentyeventh stood at thirtyive january this day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice and our prospects looked cheerless indeed a strong gale blew during the whole forenoon from the northeast and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences towards evening the gale still blowing with fury a large field in front separated and we were enabled by carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond as we approached this space we took in sail by degrees and having at length got clear lay to under a single reefed foresail january we had now tolerably pleasant weather at noon we found ourselves in latitude s longitude w having crossed the antarctic circle very little ice was to be seen to the southward although large fields of it lay behind us this day we rigged some sounding gear using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons and a line of two hundred fathoms we found the current setting to the north about a quarter of a mile per hour the temperature of the air was now about thirtyhree here we found the variation to be easterly per azimuth january we had still held on to the southward without any very great impediments on this morning however being in latitude e longitude w we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice we saw nevertheless much open water to the southward and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width through which we warped our way by sundown the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands but had no field ice and we pushed on boldly as before the cold did not seem to increase although we had snow very frequently and now and then hail squalls of great violence immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day going from southeast to northwest january the sea still remained pretty well open so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course to the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean its girth was probably at the base three quarters of a league and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides we remained in sight of this island two days and then only lost it in a fog january early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard he was an american named peter vredenburgh a native of nework and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner in going over the bows his foot slipped and he fell between two cakes of ice never rising again at noon of this day we were in latitude longitude w the cold was now excessive and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward in this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice rising in tiers one mass above the other some driftwood floated by during the evening and a great quantity of birds flew over among which were nellies peterels albatrosses and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage the variation here per azimuth was less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic circle january our passage to the south again looked doubtful as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other we stood to the westward until the fourteenth in the hope of finding an entrance january this morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us and weathering it came to an open sea without a particle of ice upon sounding with two hundred fathoms we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate of half a mile per hour the temperature of the air was fortyeven that of the water thirtyour we now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth when at noon we were in latitude longitude w we here again sounded and found a current setting still southwardly and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour the variation per azimuth had diminished and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant the thermometer being as high as fiftyne at this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered all hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole january this day was full of incident innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward and several were shot from the deck one of them a species of pelican proved to be excellent eating about midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow and upon it there appeared to be some large animal as the weather was good and nearly calm captain guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was dirk peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat upon coming up with the floe we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals being well armed we made no scruple of attacking it at once several shots were fired in quick succession the most of which took effect apparently in the head and body nothing discouraged however the monster threw himself from the ice and swam with open jaws to the boat in which were peters and myself owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure no person was ready immediately with a second shot and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale and seizing one of the men by the small of his back before any efficient means were taken to repel him in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of peters saved us from destruction leaping upon the back of the huge beast he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck reaching the spinal marrow at a blow the brute tumbled into the sea lifeless and without a struggle rolling over peters as he fell the latter soon recovered himself and a rope being thrown him he secured the carcass before entering the boat we then returned in triumph to the schooner towing our trophy behind us this bear upon admeasurement proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length his wool was perfectly white and very coarse curling tightly the eyes were of a blood red and larger than those of the arctic bear he snout also more rounded rather resembling the snout of the bulldog the meat was tender but excessively rank and fishy although the men devoured it with avidity and declared it excellent eating scarcely had we got our prize alongside when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of land on the starboard bow all hands were now upon the alert and a breeze springing up very opportunely from the northward and eastward we were soon close in with the coast it proved to be a low rocky islet of about a league in circumference and altogether destitute of vegetation if we except a species of prickly pear in approaching it from the northward a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea and bearing a strong resemblance to corded bales of cotton around this ledge to the westward is a small bay at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island but with one exception we found nothing worthy of observation in the southern extremity we picked up near the shore half buried in a pile of loose stones a piece of wood which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe there had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it and captain guy fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly besides this prow if such it were we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before around the coast we discovered occasional small floes of ice ut these were very few the exact situation of this islet to which captain guy gave the name of bennet islet in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schoone is s latitude w longitude we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators and the sea still lay perfectly open before us we found too that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded and what was still more surprising that the temperature of the air and latterly of the water became milder the weather might even be called pleasant and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass the sky was usually clear with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon his however was invariably of brief duration two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view we were getting short of fuel and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew these considerations began to impress upon captain guy the necessity of returning and he spoke of it frequently for my own part confident as i was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing and having every reason to believe from present appearances that we should not find it the steril soil met with in the higher arctic latitudes i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering at least for a few days longer in the direction we were now holding so tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man and i confess that i felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and illimed suggestions of our commander i believe indeed that what i could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on while therefore i cannot but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice i must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental however remotely in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention chapter january this morning we continued to the southward with the same pleasant weather as before the sea was entirely smooth the air tolerably warm and from the northeast the temperature of the water fiftyhree we now again got our soundingear in order and with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line found the current setting towards the pole at the rate of a mile an hour this constant tendency to the southward both in the wind and current caused some degree of speculation and even of alarm in different quarters of the schooner and i saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of captain guy he was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule however and i finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions the variation was now very trivial in the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel we also picked up a bush full of red berries like those of the hawthorn and the carcass of a singularooking landnimal it was three feet in length and but six inches in height with four very short legs the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet and resembling coral in substance the body was covered with a straight silky hair perfectly white the tail was peaked like that of a rat and about a foot and a half long the head resembled a cat with the exception of the ears hese were flapped like the ears of a dog the teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the claws footnote the terms morning and evening which i have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative as far as possible must not of course be taken in their ordinary sense for a long time past we had had no night at all the daylight being continual the dates throughout are according to nautical time and the bearings must be understood as per compass i would also remark in this place that i cannot in the first portion of what is here written pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates or latitudes and longitudes having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats in many instances i have relied altogether upon memory january toay being in latitude longitude w the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colou we again saw land from the masthead and upon a closer scrutiny found it to be one of a group of very large islands the shore was precipitous and the interior seemed to be well wooded a circumstance which occasioned us great joy in about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms sandy bottom a league from the coast as a high surf with strong ripples here and there rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency the two largest boats were now ordered out and a party well armed among whom were peters and mysel proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to encircle the island after searching about for some time we discovered an inlet which we were entering when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore filled with men who seemed to be well armed we waited for them to come up and as they moved with great rapidity they were soon within hail captain guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar when the strangers made a full stop and commenced a loud jabbering all at once intermingled with occasional shouts in which we could distinguish the words anamoooo and lamaama they continued this for at least half an hour during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance in the four canoes which might have been fifty feet long and five broad there were a hundred and ten savages in all they were about the ordinary stature of europeans but of a more muscular and brawny frame their complexion a jet black with thick and long woolly hair they were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal shaggy and silky and made to fit the body with some degree of skill the hair being inside except where turned out about the neck wrists and ankles their arms consisted principally of clubs of a dark and apparently very heavy wood some spears however were observed among them headed with flint and a few slings the bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg when they had concluded their harangue for it was clear they intended their jabbering for suc one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him this hint we pretended not to understand thinking it the wiser plan to maintain if possible the interval between us as their number more than quadrupled our own finding this to be the case the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back while he advanced towards us with his own as soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats and seated himself by the side of captain guy pointing at the same time to the schooner and repeating the words anamoooo and lamaama we now put back to the vessel the four canoes following at a little distance upon getting alongside the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight clapping his hands slapping his thighs and breast and laughing obstreperously his followers behind joined in his merriment and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening quiet being at length restored captain guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up as a necessary precaution and gave the chief whose name we soon found to be tooit to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time with this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied and gave some directions to the canoes when one of them approached the rest remaining about fifty yards off twenty of the savages now got on board and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck and scramble about among the rigging making themselves much at home and examining every article with great inquisitiveness it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race rom whose complexion indeed they appeared to recoil they believed the jane to be a living creature and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears carefully turning them up our crew were much amused with the conduct of tooit in one instance the cook was splitting some wood near the galley and by accident struck his axe into the deck making a gash of considerable depth the chief immediately ran up and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly commenced a half whine half howl strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner patting and smoothing the gash with his hand and washing it from a bucket of seawater which stood by this was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared and for my part i could not help thinking some of it affected when the visiters had satisfied as well as they could their curiosity in regard to our upper works they were admitted below when their amazement exceeded all bounds their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words for they roamed about in silence broken only by low ejaculations the arms afforded them much food for speculation and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure i do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use but rather took them for idols seeing the care we had of them and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them at the great guns their wonder was redoubled they approached them with every mark of the profoundest reverence and awe but forbore to examine them minutely there were two large mirrors in the cabin and here was the acme of their amazement tooit was the first to approach them and he had got in the middle of the cabin with his face to one and his back to the other before he fairly perceived them upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass i thought the savage would go mad but upon turning short round to make a retreat and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction i was afraid he would expire upon the spot no persuasions could prevail upon him to take another look but throwing himself upon the floor with his face buried in his hands he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner twenty at a time tooit being suffered to remain during the entire period we saw no disposition to thievery among them nor did we miss a single article after their departure throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner there were however some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand for example we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects uch as the schooner sails an egg an open book or a pan of flour we endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic but found great difficulty in being comprehended we made out nevertheless what greatly astonished us that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the gallipagos one of which we saw in the canoe of tooit we saw also some biche de mer in the hands of one of the savages who was greedily devouring it in its natural state these anomalies for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude induced captain guy to wish for a thorough investigation of the country in the hope of making a profitable speculation in his discovery for my own part anxious as i was to know something more of these islands i was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay we had now fine weather but there was no telling how long it would last and being already in the eightyourth parallel with an open sea before us a current setting strongly to the southward and the wind fair i could not listen with any patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions i represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return and winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice he at length came into my views for in some way hardly known to myself i had acquired much influence over hi and it was finally resolved that even in the event of our finding biche de mer we should only stay here a week to recruit and then push on to the southward while we might accordingly we made every necessary preparation and under the guidance of tooit got the jane through the reef in safety coming to anchor about a mile from the shore in an excellent bay completely landlocked on the southeastern coast of the main island and in ten fathoms of water black sandy bottom at the head of this bay there were three fine springs we were tol of good water and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity the four canoes followed us in keeping however at a respectful distance tooit himself remained on board and upon our dropping anchor invited us to accompany him on shore and visit his village in the interior to this captain guy consented and ten savages being left on board as hostages a party of us twelve in all got in readiness to attend the chief we took care to be well armed yet without evincing any distrust the schooner had her guns run out her boardingettings up and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence and in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours to send the cutter with a swivel round the island in search of us at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men we saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant the trees resembled no growth of either the torrid the temperate or the northern frigid zones and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed the very rocks were novel in their mass their colour and their stratification and the streams themselves utterly incredible as it may appear had so little in common with those of other climates that we were scrupulous of tasting them and indeed had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature at a small brook which crossed our path the first we had reache tooit and his attendants halted to drink on account of the singular character of the water we refused to taste it supposing it to be polluted and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid and cannot do so without many words although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so yet never except when falling in a cascade had it the customary appearance of limpidity it was nevertheless in point of fact as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence the difference being only in appearance at first sight and especially in cases where little declivity was found it bore resemblance as regards consistency to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water but this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities it was not colourless nor was it of any one uniform colour resenting to the eye as it flowed every possible shade of purple like the hues of a changeable silk this variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of tooit upon collecting a basinful and allowing it to settle thoroughly we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins each of a distinct hue that these veins did not commingle and that their cohesion was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins the water closed over it immediately as with us and also in withdrawing it all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated if however the blade was passed down accurately between two veins a perfect separation was effected which the power of cohesion did not immediately rectify the phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled chapter we were nearly three hours in reaching the village it being more than nine miles in the interior and the path lying through a rugged country as we passed along the party of tooit the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoe was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments of from two to six or seven which joined us as if by accident at different turns in the road there appeared so much of system in this that i could not help feeling distrust and i spoke to captain guy of my apprehensions it was now too late however to recede and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good faith of tooit we accordingly went on keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages and not permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between in this way passing through a precipitous ravine we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island as we came in sight of them the chief set up a shout and frequently repeated the word klocklock which we supposed to be the name of the village or perhaps the generic name for villages the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable and unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted were of no uniform plan some of them and these we found belonged to the wampoos or yampoos the great men of the lan consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root with a large black skin thrown over it and hanging in loose folds upon the ground under this the savage nestled others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees with the withered foliage upon them made to recline at an angle of fortyive degrees against a bank of clay heaped up without regular form to the height of five or six feet others again were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly and covered over with similar branches these being removed when the tenant was about to enter and pulled on again when he had entered a few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood the upper limbs being partially cut through so as to bend over upon the lower thus forming thicker shelter from the weather the greater number however consisted of small shallow caverns apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone resembling fuller earth with which three sides of the village was bounded at the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence for what purpose i could not ascertain as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening this village if it were worthy of the name lay in a valley of some depth and could only be approached from the southward the precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same magicalooking water which has been described we saw several strange animals about the dwellings all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated the largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout the tail however was bushy and the legs slender as those of the antelope its motion was exceedingly awkward and indecisive and we never saw it attempt to run we noticed also several animals very similar in appearance but of a greater length of body and covered with a black wool there were a great variety of tame fowls running about and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication going to sea periodically for food but always returning to the village as a home and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation there they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks differing very little from the canvassack of our own country black gannets and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance but not carnivorous of fish there seemed to be a great abundance we saw during our visit a quantity of dried salmon rock cod blue dolphins mackerel blackfish skate conger elephantish mullets soles parrotfish leatherackets gurnards hake flounders paracutas and innumerable other varieties we noticed too that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of the lord auckland islands in a latitude as low as fiftyne degrees south the gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful we saw but few wild animals and none of a large size or of a species with which we were familiar one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path but the natives paid them little attention and we concluded that they were not venomous as we approached the village with tooit and his party a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us with loud shouts among which we could only distinguish the everlasting anamoooo and lamaama we were much surprised at perceiving that with one or two exceptions these new comers were entirely naked the skins being used only by the men of the canoes all the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter for there was no appearance of any among the villagers there were a great many women and children the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty they were straight tall and well formed with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society their lips however like those of the men were thick and clumsy so that even when laughing the teeth were never disclosed their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed like the party of tooit in dresses of black skin and armed with lances and heavy clubs these appeared to have great influence among the rest and were always addressed by the title wampoo these too were the tenants of the black skin palaces that of tooit was situated in the centre of the village and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind the tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabout from the root and there were several branches left just below the cut these serving to extend the covering and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk the covering too which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground the floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible tooit seated himself on the leaves and made signs that we should follow his example this we did and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable if not indeed critical we were on the ground twelve in number with the savages as many as forty sitting on their hams so closely around us that if any disturbance had arisen we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms or indeed to have risen on our feet the pressure was not only inside the tent but outside where probably was every individual on the whole island the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and vociferations of tooit our chief security lay however in the presence of tooit himself among us and we resolved to stick by him closely as the best chance of extricating ourselves from the dilemma sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes with the exception that the anamoooos were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the lamaamas we listened in profound silence until the conclusion of his harangue when captain guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and goodill concluding what he had to say by a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife at the former the monarch much to our surprise turned up his nose with some expression of contempt but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction and he immediately ordered dinner this was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a species of unknown animal probably one of the slimegged hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village seeing us at a loss how to proceed he began by way of setting us an example to devour yard after yard of the enticing food until we could positively stand it no longer and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the lookinglasses we declined however partaking of the delicacies before us and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever having just finished a hearty jeuner when the monarch had made an end of his meal we commenced a series of crossuestioning in every ingenious manner we could devise with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country and whether any of them might be turned to profit at length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning and offered to accompany us to a part of the coast where he assured us the biche de mer pointing to a specimen of that anima was to be found in great abundance we were glad at this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd and signified our eagerness to proceed we now left the tent and accompanied by the whole population of the village followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island not far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor we waited here for about an hour until the four canoes were brought round by some of the savages to our station the whole of our party then getting into one of them we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned and of another still farther out where we saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seaman among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce we stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary when we were taken alongside the schooner and parted with tooit after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us in the course of twentyour hours as many of the canvassack ducks and gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold in the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village chapter the chief was as good as his word and we were soon plentifully supplied with fresh provision we found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl being exceedingly tender juicy and welllavoured besides these the savages brought us upon our making them comprehend our wishes a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass with a canoeoad of fresh fish and some dried the celery was a treat indeed and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease in a very short time we had not a single person on the sickist we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provision among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling the muscle in shape but with the taste of an oyster shrimps too and prawns were abundant and albatross and other birds eggs with dark shells we took in too a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before most of the men found it a palatable food but i thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable in return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads brass trinkets nails knives and pieces of red cloth they being fully delighted in the exchange we established a regular market on shore just under the guns of the schooner where our barterings were carried on with every appearance of good faith and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of klocklock had not led us to expect from the savages matters went on thus very amicably for several days during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner and parties of our men frequently on shore making long excursions into the interior and receiving no molestation whatever finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with biche de mer owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it captain guy resolved to enter into negotiation with tooit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement a bargain was accordingly struck perfectly satisfactory to both parties by which it was arranged that after making the necessary preparations such as laying off the proper grounds erecting a portion of the buildings and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required the schooner should proceed on her route leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project and instruct the natives in drying the biche de mer in regard to terms these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence they were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads knives red cloth and so forth for every certain number of piculs of the biche de mer which should be ready on our return a description of the nature of this important article of commerce and the method of preparing it may prove of some interest to my readers and i can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it the following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the south seas it is that mollusca from the indian seas which is known in commerce by the french name bouche de mer a nice morsel from the se if i am not much mistaken the celebrated cuvier calls it gasteropeda pulmonifera it is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the pacific islands and gathered especially for the chinese market where it commands a great price perhaps as much as their muchalked of edible bird nests which are probably made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these mollusc they have no shell no legs nor any prominent part except an absorbing and an excretory opposite organs but by their elastic wings like caterpillars or worms they creep in shallow waters in which when low they can be seen by a kind of swallow the sharp bill of which inserted in the soft animal draws a gummy and filamentous substance which by drying can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest hence the name of gasteropeda pulmonifera this mollusca is oblong and of different sizes from three to eighteen inches in length and i have seen a few that were not less than two feet long they are nearly round a little flattish on one side which lies next the bottom of the sea and they are from one to eight inches thick they crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year probably for the purpose of gendering as we often find them in pairs it is when the sun has the most power on the water rendering it tepid that they approach the shore and they often go up into places so shallow that on the tide receding they are left dry exposed to the heat of the sun but they do not bring forth their young in shallow water as we never see any of their progeny and the fullrown ones are always observed coming in from deep water they feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce the coral the biche de mer is generally taken in three or four feet water after which they are brought on shore and split at one end with a knife the incision being one inch or more according to the size of the mollusca through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep the article is then washed and afterward boiled to a certain degree which must not be too much or too little they are then buried in the ground for four hours then boiled again for a short time after which they are dried either by the fire or the sun those cured by the sun are worth the most but where one picul lbs can be cured that way i can cure thirty piculs by the fire when once properly cured they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk but they should be examined once in every few months say four times a year to see if any dampness is likely to affect them the chinese as before stated consider biche de mer a very great luxury believing that it wonderfully strengthens and nourishes the system and renews the exhausted system of the immoderate voluptuary the first quality commands a high price in canton being worth ninety dollars a picul the second quality seventyive dollars the third fifty dollars the fourth thirty dollars the fifth twenty dollars the sixth twelve dollars the seventh eight dollars and the eighth four dollars small cargoes however will often bring more in manilla singapore and batavia an agreement having been thus entered into we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground a large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected where there was plenty both of wood and water and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the biche de mer was to be procured we now all set to work in good earnest and soon to the great astonishment of the savages had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind these were john carson alfred harris and peterson all natives of london i believ who volunteered their services in this respect by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure we had agreed however to pay a formal visit of leavestaking to the village and tooit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good faith of the savages they had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum aiding us with alacrity in our work offering us their commodities frequently without price and never in any instance pilfering a single article although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon our making them a present the women especially were most obliging in every respect and upon the whole we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us so well a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeplyaid plan for our destruction and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem were among the most barbarous subtle and bloodthirsty wretches that ever contaminated the face of the globe it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village although as said before we entertained not the slightest suspicion still no proper precaution was neglected six men were left in the schooner with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence under any pretence whatever and to remain constantly on deck the boardingettings were up the guns doublehotted with grape and canister and the swivels loaded with canisters of musketalls she lay with her anchor apeak about a mile from the shore and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our swivels immediately the six men being left on board our shorearty consisted of thirtywo persons in all we were armed to the teeth having with us muskets pistols and cutlasses besides each a long kind of seaman knife somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country a hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way we noticed however with some surprise that they were now entirely without arms and upon questioning tooit in relation to this circumstance he merely answered that mattee non we pa pa si eaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers we took this in good part and proceeded we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of soapstone hills among which the village was situated this gorge was very rocky and uneven so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to klocklock the whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half or probably two miles it wound in every possible direction through the hills having apparently formed at some remote period the bed of a torren in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn the sides of this dell would have averaged i am sure seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate the general width was about forty feet and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast in short there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it when i now think of our egregious folly the chief subject of astonishment seems to be that we should have ever ventured under any circumstances so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine yet such was the order we blindly took up trusting foolishly to the force of our party the unarmed condition of tooit and his men the certain efficacy of our firerms whose effect was yet a secret to the native and more than all to the longustained pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches five or six of them went on before as if to lead the way ostentatiously busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path next came our own party we walked closely together taking care only to prevent separation behind followed the main body of the savages observing unusual order and decorum dirk peters a man named wilson allen and myself were on the right of our companions examining as we went along the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us a fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention it was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course sloping afterward to the left the height of the opening as far as we could see into it from the main gorge was perhaps sixty or seventy feet there were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices bearing a species of filbert which i felt some curiosity to examine and pushed in briskly for that purpose gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp and then hastily retreating as i turned i found that peters and allen had followed me i desired them to go back as there was not room for two persons to pass saying they should have some of my nuts they accordingly turned and were scrambling back allen being close to the mouth of the fissure when i was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before experienced and which impressed me with a vague conception if indeed i then thought of anything that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand chapter as soon as i could collect my scattered senses i found myself nearly suffocated and grovelling in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction threatening to bury me entirely horribly alarmed at this idea i struggled to gain my feet and at length succeeded i then remained motionless for some moments endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me and where i was presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear and afterward the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name of god i scrambled one or two paces forward when i fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion who i soon discovered was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i could command and at length succeeded in getting him out as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had by some convulsion of nature or probably from their own weight caved in overhead and that we were consequently lost for ever being thus entombed alive for a long time we gave up supinely to the most intense agony and despair such as cannot be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar situation i firmly believe that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own of living inhumation the blackness of darkness which envelops the victim the terrific oppression of lungs the stifling fumes from the damp earth unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope and that such is the allotted portion of the dead to carry into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated ever to be conceived at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity and grope about our prison it being barely possible he observed that some opening might be yet left us for escape i caught eagerly at this hope and arousing myself to exertion attempted to force my way through the loose earth hardly had i advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible enough to convince me that at all events we should not immediately perish for want of air we now took some degree of heart and encouraged each other to hope for the best having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light we found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure where it made a turn to the left a few struggles more and we reached the bend when to our inexpressible joy there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance generally at an angle of about fortyive degrees although sometimes much more precipitous we could not see through the whole extent of this opening but as a good deal of light came down it we had little doubt of finding at the top of it if we could by any means reach the to a clear passage into the open air i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge and that our companion allen was still missing we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him after a long search and much danger from the farther caving in of the earth above us peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our companion foot and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond a possibility of extricating him i soon found that what he said was too true and that of course life had been long extinct with sorrowful hearts therefore we left the corpse to its fate and again made our way to the bend the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us and after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up we began once more to despair i have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling soapstone the sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material and so excessively slippery being wet that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts in some places where the ascent was nearly perpendicular the difficulty was of course much aggravated and indeed for some time we thought it insurmountable we took courage however from despair and what by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives and swinging at the risk of our lives to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass we at length reached a natural platform from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky at the extremity of a thicklyooded ravine looking back now with somewhat more leisure at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded we clearly saw from the appearance of its sides that it was of late formation and we concluded that the concussion whatever it was which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us had also at the same moment laid open this path for escape being quite exhausted with exertion and indeed so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our girdles he muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm subsequent events proved that had we fired we should have sorely repented it but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts after having reposed for about an hour we pushed on slowly up the ravine and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells at length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground for our path hitherto since leaving the platform had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage at a vast distance overhead with great caution we stole to a narrow opening through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills the gorge in which our party of thirtywo had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us but for at least one hundred yards the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it the means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining in several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge we were now on the wester might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth in these spots the earth had not given way but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen it was clear from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rocklaster that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted at not more than a yard apart for the length of perhaps three hundred feet and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes i have already spoken of the singular stratification of these soapstone hills and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of its nature this was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another and a very moderate exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends there can be no doubt that by the continuous line of stakes a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes and extending back from the edge of the clif a vast leverage power was obtained capable of hurling the whole face of the hill upon a given signal into the bosom of the abyss below the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty we alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction we were the only living white men upon the island chapter our situation as it now appeared was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed for ever we saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them we might to be sure conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills and as a final resort in the chasm from which we had just issued but we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and famine or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages crowds of whom we now perceived had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the jane the vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them how we longed at that moment to be with them either to aid in effecting their escape or to perish with them in attempting a defence we saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads with but a remote hope of benefit to them a pistol fired might suffice to apprize them that something wrong had occurred but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith t could not tell them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain that their companions were no longer among the living upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe who were now getting ready to attack than they already were and always had been no good therefore and infinite harm would result from our firing and after mature deliberation we forbore our next thought was to attempt a rush towards the vessel to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay and endeavour to force a passage on board but the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident the country as i said before was literally swarming with the natives skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills so as not to be observed from the schooner in our immediate vicinity especially and blockading the sole path by which we could hope to attain the shore in the proper point were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors with tooit at their head and apparently only waiting for some renforcement to commence his onset upon the jane the canoes too which lay at the head of the bay were manned with savages unarmed it is true but who undoubtedly had arms within reach we were forced therefore however unwillingly to remain in our place of concealment mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts or flatboats with outriggers filled with savages and coming round the southern bight of the harbour they appeared to have no arms except short clubs and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts immediately afterward another detachment still larger approached in an opposite direction and with similar weapons the four canoes too were now quickly filled with natives starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay and put off swiftly to join the other parties thus in less time than i have taken to tell it and as if by magic the jane saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant the six men left in the vessel however resolutely they might engage in her defence were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds i could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all but in this was deceived for presently i saw them get springs upon the cable and bring the vessel starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes which by this time were within pistol range the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward owing to some cause unknown but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation the discharge was an entire failure not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured the shots striking short and ricoch ting over their heads the only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke which was so excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would abandon their design entirely and return to the shore and this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms in which as the canoes were now so near at hand they could not have failed in doing some execution sufficient at least to deter this party from a farther advance until they could have given the rafts also a broadside but in place of this they left the canoe party to recover from their panic and by looking about them to see that no injury had been sustained while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect the star and doubleeaded shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder and killed perhaps thirty or forty of the savages outright while a hundred of them at least were thrown into the water the most of them dreadfully wounded the remainder frightened out of their senses commenced at once a precipitate retreat not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions who were swimming about in every direction screaming and yelling for aid this great success however came too late for the salvation of our devoted people the canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the boarding nettings even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns nothing could now withstand their brute rage our men were borne down at once overwhelmed trodden under foot and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant seeing this the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears and came up in shoals to the plunder in five minutes the jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage the decks were split open and ripped up the cordage sails and everything moveable on deck demolished as if by magic while by dint of pushing at the stern towing with the canoes and hauling at the sides as they swam in thousands around the vessel the wretches finally forced her on shore the cable having been slippe and delivered her over to the good offices of tooit who during the whole of the engagement had maintained like a skilful general his post of security and reconnoissance among the hills but now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin and become a partaker in the spoils tooit descent left us at liberty to quit our hidinglace and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm at about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water at which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us not far from the spring we discovered several of the filbertushes which i mentioned before upon tasting the nuts we found them palatable and very nearly resembling in flavour the common english filbert we collected our hats full immediately deposited them within the ravine and returned for more while we were busily employed in gathering these a rustling in the bushes alarmed us and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert when a large black bird of the bittern species strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs i was so much startled that i could do nothing but peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape and seize it by the neck its struggles and screams were tremendous and we had thoughts of letting it go lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood a stab with a bowie knife however at length brought it to the ground and we dragged it into the ravine congratulating ourselves that at all events we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week we now went out again to look about us and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill but met with nothing else which could serve us for food we therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village laden with the plunder of the vessel and who we were apprehensive might discover us in passing beneath the hill our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible and with this object we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm we left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay without the risk of being discovered from below having done this we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position for we were now completely excluded from observation as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself and not venture out upon the hill we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow but indeed when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent we resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly when a good opportunity should offer in the mean time we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel and were now preparing to set her on fire in a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her mainatchway and shortly afterward a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle the rigging masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately and the fire spread rapidly along the decks still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her hammering with large stones axes and cannon balls at the bolts and other copper and iron work on the beach and in canoes and rafts there were not less altogether in the immediate vicinity of the schooner than ten thousand natives besides the shoals of them who laden with booty were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands we now anticipated a catastrophe and were not disappointed first of all there came a smart shock which we felt distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly galvanize but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion the savages were evidently startled and paused for an instant from their labours and yellings they were upon the point of recommencing when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks resembling a black and heavy thunderloud hen as if from its bowels arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height apparently of a quarter of a mile hen there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame hen the whole atmosphere was magically crowded in a single instant with a wild chaos of wood and metal and human limbs nd lastly came the concussion in its fullest fury which hurled us impetuously from our feet while the hills echoed and rechoed the tumult and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation and they had now indeed reaped the full and perfect fruits of their treachery perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion while at least an equal number were desperately mangled the whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches and on shore matters were even worse they seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture and made no efforts at assisting one another at length we observed a total change in their demeanour from absolute stupor they appeared to be all at once aroused to the highest pitch of excitement and rushed wildly about going to and from a certain point on the beach with the strangest expressions of mingled horror rage and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances and shouting at the top of their voices tekelii tekelii presently we saw a large body go off into the hills whence they returned in a short time carrying stakes of wood these they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement we perceived something white lying on the ground but could not immediately make out what it was at length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of january captain guy had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england i remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers it had now been thrown on shore by the explosion but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance none of them seemed willing to approach it closely byndy the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it and no sooner was this arrangement completed than the whole of the vast assembly rushed into the interior of the island with loud screams of tekelii tekelii chapter during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hidinglace upon the hill going out only occasionally and then with the greatest precaution for water and filberts we had made a kind of pentouse on the platform furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves and placing in it three large flat stones which served us for both fireplace and table we kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together the one soft the other hard the bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating although somewhat tough it was not an oceanic fowl but a species of bittern with jet black and grizzly plumage and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine apparently seeking for the one we had captured but as they never alighted we had no opportunity of catching them as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation but it was now entirely consumed and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision the filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger afflicting us too with severe gripings of the bowels and if freely indulged in with violent headache we had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill and perceived they might be easily taken if we could get at them without the observation of the natives it was resolved therefore to make an attempt at descending we commenced by going down the southern declivity which seemed to offer the fewest difficulties but had not proceeded a hundred yards before as we had anticipated from appearances on the hillo our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished we now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth and not being able to make our way along the brink of it we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine we now pushed over to the eastward but with precisely similar fortune after an hour scramble at the risk of breaking our necks we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite with fine dust at the bottom and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down toiling again up this path we now tried the northern edge of the hill here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our manoeuvres as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village we crawled along therefore on our hands and knees and occasionally were even forced to throw ourselves at full length dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery in this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen and leading directly into the main gorge thus our fears were fully confirmed and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below thoroughly exhausted by our exertions we made the best of our way back to the platform and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves slept sweetly and soundly for some hours for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources we found that it would afford us no food with the exception of the unwholesome filberts and a rank species of scurvy grass which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square and would be soon exhausted on the fifteenth of february as near as i can remember there was not a blade of this left and the nuts were growing scarce our situation therefore could hardly be more lamentable on the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison in hope of finding some avenue of escape but to no purpose we also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed with the faint expectation of discovering through this channel some opening to the main ravine here too we were disappointed although we found and brought up with us a musket footnote this day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour i have before spoken of on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search we remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into and we were anxious to explore it although with no expectation of discovering here any opening we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention it was indeed one of the most singularooking places imaginable and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature the pit from its eastern to its western extremity was about five hundred yards in length when all its windings were threaded the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more i should suppose having no means of accurate examinatio than forty or fifty yards upon first descending into the chasm that is to say for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other and apparently had at no time been connected the one surface being of the soapstone and the other of marl granulated with some metallic matter the average breadth or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet but there seemed to be no regularity of formation passing down however beyond the limit spoken of the interval rapidly contracted and the sides began to run parallel although for some distance farther they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom a perfect regularity commenced the sides were now entirely uniform in substance in colour and in lateral direction the material being a very black and shining granite and the distance between the two sides at all points facing each other exactly twenty yards the precise formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a delineation taken upon the spot for i had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil which i preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure and to which i am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance illustration figure this figure see figure gives the general outlines of the chasm without the minor cavities in the sides of which there were several each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite the bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite to the right at the lower extremity will be noticed the appearance of a small opening this is the fissure alluded to above and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit we now pushed into it with vigour cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape we were encouraged to persevere however by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end we at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet and found that the aperture was a low and regularlyormed arch having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm a strong light now broke upon us and turning a short bend we found ourselves in another lofty chamber similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form its general figure is here given see figure illustration figure the total length of this chasm commencing at the opening a and proceeding round the curve b to the extremity is five hundred and fifty yards at we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints we forced our way through it finding it about forty feet long and emerged into a third chasm this too was precisely like the first except in its longitudinal shape which was thus see figure illustration figure illustration figure we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards at the point a was an opening about six feet wide and extending fifteen feet into the rock where it terminated in a bed of marl there being no other chasm beyond as we had expected we were about leaving this fissure into which very little light was admitted when peters called my attention to a range of singularooking indentures in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the culeac with a very slight exertion of the imagination the left or most northerly of these indentures might have been taken for the intentional although rude representation of a human figure standing erect with outstretched arm the rest of them bore also some little resemblance to alphabetical characters and peters was willing at all events to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such i convinced him of his error finally by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure where among the powder we picked up piece by piece several large flakes of the marl which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the indentures were found and which had projecting points exactly fitting the indentures thus proving them to have been the work of nature figure presents an accurate copy of the whole illustration figure after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison we made our way back dejected and dispirited to the summit of the hill nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twentyour hours except that in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm we found two triangular holes of great depth and also with black granite sides into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending as they had the appearance of mere natural wells without outlet they were each about twenty yards in circumference and their shape as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm is shown in figure preceding page chapter on the twentieth of the month finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the filberts the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill the face of the precipice was here of the softest species of soapstone although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the leas and in many places even overarching after long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf upon this peters contrived to leap with what assistance i could render him by means of our pocketandkerchiefs tied together with somewhat more difficulty i also got down and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the hill hat is by cutting steps in the face of the soapstone with our knives the extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived but as there was no other resource we determined to undertake it upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbertushes and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs the other end being tied round peters waist i lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone as far in as eight or ten inche sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot or thereabout so as to allow of his driving with the butt of a pistol a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface i then drew him up for about four feet when he made a hole similar to the one below driving in a peg as before and having thus a restinglace for both feet and hands i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush throwing him the end which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is to the full extent of the handkerchiefs here he dug another hole and drove another peg he then drew himself up so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above it was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost peg with the view of fastening them to the second and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart however after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot having to hold on with his left hand while he laboured to undo the fastening with his righ he at length cut the string leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg tying the handkerchiefs now to the second peg he descended to a station below the third taking care not to go too far down by these means means which i should never have conceived of myself and for which we were indebted altogether to peters ingenuity and resolutio my companion finally succeeded with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff in reaching the bottom without accident it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to follow him but i did at length attempt it peters had taken off his shirt before descending and this with my own formed the rope necessary for the adventure after throwing down the musket found in the chasm i fastened this rope to the bushes and let myself down rapidly striving by the vigour of my movements to banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depth yet to be descended and the precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my only support it was in vain i endeavoured to banish these reflections and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the cliff before me the more earnestly i struggled not to think the more intensely vivid became my conceptions and the more horribly distinct at length arrived that crisis of fancy so fearful in all similar cases the crisis in which we begin to anticipate the feelings with which we shall fall o picture to ourselves the sickness and dizziness and the last struggle and the half swoon and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent and now i found these fancies creating their own realities and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact i felt my knees strike violently together while my fingers were gradually yet certainly relaxing their grasp there was a ringing in my ears and i said this is my knell of death and now i was consumed with the irrepressible desire of looking below i could not i would not confine my glances to the cliff and with a wild indefinable emotion half of horror half of a relieved oppression i threw my vision far down into the abyss for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold while with the movement the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered like a shadow through my mind n the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall a desire a yearning a passion utterly uncontrollable i let go at once my grasp upon the peg and turning half round from the precipice remained tottering for an instant against its naked face but now there came a spinning of the brain a shrillounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears a dusky fiendish and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me and sighing i sunk down with a bursting heart and plunged within its arms i had swooned and peters had caught me as i fell he had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the cliff and perceiving my imminent danger had endeavoured to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all at length seeing me totter he hastened to ascend to my rescue and arrived just in time for my preservation had i fallen with my full weight the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped and i should have been precipitated into the abyss as it was he contrived to let me down gently so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned this was in about fifteen minutes on recovery my trepidation had entirely vanished i felt a new being and with some little further aid from my companion reached the bottom also in safety we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fallen the place was one of singular wildness and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded babylon not to speak of the ruins of the disruptured cliff which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge tumuli apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of art although in detail no semblance of art could be detected scoria were abundant and large shapeless blocks of the black granite intermingled with others of marl and both granulated with metal of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight several immense scorpions were seen and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes footnote the marl was also black indeed we noticed no lightoloured substances of any kind upon the island as food was our most immediate object we resolved to make our way to the seacoast distant not more than half a mile with a view of catching turtle several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill we had proceeded some hundred yards threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli when upon turning a corner five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern felling peters to the ground with a blow from a club as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim leaving me time to recover from my astonishment i still had the musket but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless preferring to trust my pistols which had been carefully preserved in order with these i advanced upon the assailants firing one after the other in quick succession two savages fell and one who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose my companion being thus released we had no further difficulty he had his pistols also but prudently declined using them confiding in his great personal strength which far exceeded that of any person i have ever known seizing a club from one of the savages who had fallen he dashed out the brains of the three who remained killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon and leaving us completely masters of the field so rapidly had these events passed that we could scarcely believe in their reality and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery to regain the cliff it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts and even should we succeed in arriving at its base we should never be able to ascend it without being seen our situation was one of the greatest peril and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight when one of the savages whom i had shot and supposed dead sprang briskly to his feet and attempted to make his escape we overtook him however before he had advanced many paces and were about to put him to death when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt at escape we therefore dragged him with us making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance in a few minutes he was perfectly submissive and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks making for the seashore so far the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea except at intervals from our sight and when we first had it fairly in view it was perhaps two hundred yards distant as we emerged into the open beach we saw to our great dismay an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village and from all visible quarters of the island making towards us with gesticulations of extreme fury and howling like wild beasts we were upon the point of turning upon our steps and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water towards these we now ran with all speed and reaching them found them unguarded and without any other freight than three of the large gallipago turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers we instantly took possession of one of them and forcing our captive on board pushed out to sea with all the strength we could command we had not made however more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages who by this time were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit no time was now to be lost our hope was at best a forlorn one but we had none other it was very doubtful whether with the utmost exertion we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe but yet there was a chance that we could we might save ourselves if we succeeded while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike and in place of turning it round we merely changed our position in paddling as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells as well as their speed and approached with inconceivable rapidity we pulled however with all the energy of desperation and arrived at the contested point before more than one of the natives had attained it this man paid dearly for his superior agility peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore the foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe we at first endeavoured to pull her into the deep water beyond the reach of the savages but finding her too firmly aground and there being no time to spare peters with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side we then pushed off two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat obstinately refusing to let go until we were forced to despatch them with our knives we were now clear off and making great way out to sea the main body of the savages upon reaching the broken canoe set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable in truth from everything i could see of these wretches they appeared to be the most wicked hypocritical vindictive bloodthirsty and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe it is clear we should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands they made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe but finding it useless again vented their rage in a series of hideous vociferations and rushed up into the hills we were thus relieved from immediate danger but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy we knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages and were not aware of the fact afterward ascertained from our captiv that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the jane guy we calculated therefore upon being yet pursued as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay distant about three mile where the boats were usually laid up fearing this we made every exertion to leave the island behind us and went rapidly through the water forcing the prisoner to take a paddle in about half an hour when we had gained probably five or six miles to the southward a large fleet of the flatottomed canoes or rafts was seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit presently they put back despairing to overtake us chapter we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean in a latitude exceeding eightyour degrees in a frail canoe and with no provision but the three turtles the long polar winter too could not be considered as far distant and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued there were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group and distant from each other about five or six leagues but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture in coming from the northward in the jane guy we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of ice his however little it may be in accordance with the generallyeceived notions respecting the antarctic was a fact experience would not permit us to deny to attempt therefore getting back would be folly specially at so late a period of the season only one course seemed to be left open for hope we resolved to steer boldly to the southward where there was at least a probability of discovering other lands and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate so far we had found the antarctic like the arctic ocean peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water but our canoe was at best of frail structure although large and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit the body of the boat was of no better material than bark he bark of a tree unknown the ribs were of a tough osier well adapted to the purpose for which it was used we had fifty feet room from stem to stern from four to six in breadth and in depth throughout four feet and a half he boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted we never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them and some days after this period discovered by questioning our captive that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them having fallen accidentally into the hands of our barbarians what we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed several wide rents were discovered near both ends and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket with the help of the superfluous paddles of which there were a great many we erected a kind of framework about the bow so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter we also set up two paddlelades for masts placing them opposite each other one by each gunwale thus saving the necessity of a yard to these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts oing this with some difficulty as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever although he had been willing enough to labour in all the other operations the sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner he could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it shuddering when we attempted to force him and shrieking out tekelii having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe we now set sail to the south southeast for the present with the view of weathering the most southerly of the group in sight this being done we turned the bow full to the southward the weather could by no means be considered disagreeable we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward a smooth sea and continual daylight no ice whatever was to be seen nor did i ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of bennet islet indeed the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity having killed the largest of our tortoises and obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water we continued on our course without any incident of moment for perhaps seven or eight days during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward as the wind blew constantly with us and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing march many unusual phenomena now indicated that we were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder a high range of light gray vapour appeared constantly in the southern horizon flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks now darting from east to west now from west to east and again presenting a level and uniform summit n short having all the wild variations of the aurora borealis the average height of this vapour as apparent from our station was about twentyive degrees the temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily and there was a very perceptible alteration in its colour footnote for obvious reasons i cannot pretend to strict accuracy in these dates they are given principally with a view to perspicuity of narration and as set down in my pencil memoranda march toay by repeated questioning of our captive we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre its inhabitants and customs ut with these how can i now detain the reader i may say however that we learned there were eight islands in the group hat they were governed by a common king named tsalemon or psalemoun who resided in one of the smallest of the islands hat the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the king hat the inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the flatottomed rafts the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession and these having been obtained by mere accident from some large island to the southwest hat his own name was nuu hat he had no knowledge of bennet islet nd that the appellation of the island we had left was tsalal the commencement of the words tsalemon and tsalal was given with a prolonged hissing sound which we found it impossible to imitate even after repeated endeavours and which was precisely the same with the note of the black bittern we had eaten upon the summit of the hill march the heat of the water was now truly remarkable and its colour was undergoing a rapid change being no longer transparent but of a milky consistency and hue in our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth never so rough as to endanger the canoe ut we were frequently surprised at perceiving to our right and left at different distances sudden and extensive agitations of the surface hese we at length noticed were always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapour to the southward march toay with the view of widening our sail the breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly i took from my coatocket a white handkerchief nuu was seated at my elbow and the linen accidentally flaring in his face he became violently affected with convulsions these were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor and low murmurings of tekelii tekelii march the wind had entirely ceased but it was evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward under the influence of a powerful current and now indeed it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were taking ut we felt none the countenance of peters indicated nothing of this nature although it wore at times an expression i could not fathom the polar winter appeared to be coming on ut coming without its terrors i felt a numbness of body and mind dreaminess of sensation ut this was all march the gray vapour had now arisen many more degrees above the horizon and was gradually losing its grayness of tint the heat of the water was extreme even unpleasant to the touch and its milky hue was more evident than ever toay a violent agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe it was attended as usual with a wild flaring up of the vapour at its summit and a momentary division at its base a fine white powder resembling ashes ut certainly not such ell over the canoe and over a large surface of the water as the flickering died away among the vapour and the commotion subsided in the sea nuu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat and no persuasions could induce him to arise march this day we questioned nuu concerning the motives of his countrymen in destroying our companions but he appeared to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat and upon our reiterating the questions as to the motive made use only of idiotic gesticulations such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it these were black we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant of tsalal march toay there floated by us one of the white animals whose appearance upon the beach at tsalal had occasioned so wild a commotion among the savages i would have picked it up but there came over me a sudden listlessness and i forbore the heat of the water still increased and the hand could no longer be endured within it peters spoke little and i knew not what to think of his apathy nuu breathed and no more march the white ashy material fell now continually around us and in vast quantities the range of vapour to the southward had arisen prodigiously in the horizon and began to assume more distinctness of form i can liken it to nothing but a limitless cataract rolling silently into the sea from some immense and faristant rampart in the heaven the gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon it emitted no sound march a sullen darkness now hovered above us ut from out the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose and stole up along the bulwarks of the boat we were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe but melted into the water as it fell the summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity at intervals there were visible in it wide yawning but momentary rents and from out these rents within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images there came rushing and mighty but soundless winds tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course march the darkness had materially increased relieved only by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil and their scream was the eternal tekelii as they retreated from our vision hereupon nuu stirred in the bottom of the boat but upon touching him we found his spirit departed and now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract where a chasm threw itself open to receive us but there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure very far larger in its proportions than any dweller among men and the hue of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow note the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of mr pym are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press it is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative and which were retained by him while the above were in type for the purpose of revision have been irrecoverably lost through the accident by which he perished himself this however may prove not to be the case and the papers if ultimately found will be given to the public no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency the gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface and who from the statement there made might be supposed able to fill the vacuum has declined the task his for satisfactory reasons connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded him and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration peters from whom some information might be expected is still alive and a resident of illinois but cannot be met with at present he may hereafter be found and will no doubt afford material for a conclusion of mr pym account the loss of the two or three final chapters for there were but two or thre is the more deeply to be regretted as it cannot be doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself or at least to regions in its very near proximity and as too the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the southern ocean on one point in the narrative some remarks may be well offered and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit in any degree upon the very singular pages now published we allude to the chasms found in the island of tsalal and to the whole of the figures in the latter portion of chapter mr pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment and speaks decidedly of the indentures found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to alphabetical characters and in short as being positively not such this assertion is made in a manner so simple and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive viz the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the indentures upon the wal that we are forced to believe the writer in earnest and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise but as the facts in relation to all the figures are most singular especially when taken in connexion with statements made in the body of the narrativ it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them all his too the more especially as the facts in question have beyond doubt escaped the attention of mr poe figure then figure figure and figure when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches which it will be remembered served only as means of communication between the main chambers and were of totally distinct characte constitute an ethiopian verbal root he root illustratio to be shady hence all the inflections of shadow or darkness in regard to the left or most northwardly of the indentures in figure it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was correct and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the work of art and intended as the representation of a human form the delineation is before the reader and he may or may not perceive the resemblance suggested but the rest of the indentures afford strong confirmation of peters idea the upper range is evidently the arabic verbal root illustratio to be white whence all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness the lower range is not so immediately perspicuous the characters are somewhat broken and disjointed nevertheless it cannot be doubted that in their perfect state they formed the full egyptian word illustratio the region of the south it should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the most northwardly of the figures the arm is outstretched towards the south conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting conjecture they should be regarded perhaps in connexion with some of the most faintlyetailed incidents of the narrative although in no visible manner is this chain of connexion complete tekelii was the cry of the affrighted natives of tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the white animal picked up at sea this also was the shuddering exclamation of the captive tsalalian upon encountering the white materials in possession of mr pym this also was the shriek of the swiftlying white and gigantic birds which issued from the vapoury white curtain of the south nothing white was to be found at tsalal and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond it is not impossible that tsalal the appellation of the island of the chasms may be found upon minute philological scrutiny to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves or some reference to the ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings i have graven it within the hills and my vengeance upon the dust within the rock
