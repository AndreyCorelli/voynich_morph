may your deeds approve that good effects may spring from words of love thus kent o princes bids you all adieu hel shape his old course in a country new here france and burgundy my noble lord my lord of burgundy we first address towards you who with this king hath rivall for our daughter what in the least will you require in present dower with her or cease your quest of love most royal majesty i crave no more than what your highness offer nor will you tender less right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is fall sir there she stands if aught within that little seeming substance or all of it with our displeasure pieced and nothing more may fitly like your grace she there and she is yours i know no answer will you with those infirmities she owes unfriended newdopted to our hate dower with our curse and stranger with our oath take her or leave her pardon me royal sir election makes not up on such conditions then leave her sir for by the power that made me i tell you all her wealth for you great king i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you to avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed almost to acknowledge hers this is most strange that she that even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age most best most dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your foreouch affection fall into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle could never plant in me i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend il do before i speak hat you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonour step that hath deprived me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a stilloliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better is it but this tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do my lord of burgundy what say you to the lady love not love when it is mingled with regards that stand aloof from the entire point will you have her she is herself a dowry royal lear give but that portion which yourself proposed and here i take cordelia by the hand duchess of burgundy nothing i have sworn i am firm i am sorry then you have so lost a father that you must lose a husband peace be with burgundy since that respects of fortune are his love i shall not be his wife fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor most choice forsaken and most loved despised thee and thy virtues here i seize upon be it lawful i take up what cast away gods gods is strange that from their coldt neglect my love should kindle to inflamed respect thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance is queen of us of ours and our fair france not all the dukes of waterish burgundy can buy this unprized precious maid of me bid them farewell cordelia though unkind thou losest here a better where to find thou hast her france let her be thine for we have no such daughter nor shall ever see that face of hers again therefore be gone without our grace our love our benison come noble burgundy bid farewell to your sisters the jewels of our father with wash eyes cordelia leaves you i know you what you are and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named use well our father to your professed bosoms i commit him but yet alas stood i within his grace i would prefer him to a better place so farewell to you both prescribe not us our duties let your study be to content your lord who hath received you at fortune alms you have obedience scanted and well are worth the want that you have wanted time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides who cover faults at last shame them derides well may you prosper come my fair cordelia sister it is not a little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both i think our father will hence toight that most certain and with you next month with us you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly is the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of longngraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent banishment there is further compliment of leavetaking between france and him pray you let hit together if our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us we shall further think on we must do something and i the heat thou nature art my goddess to thy law my services are bound wherefore should i stand in the plague of custom and permit the curiosity of nations to deprive me for that i am some twelve or fourteen moonhines lag of a brother why bastard wherefore base when my dimensions are as well compact my mind as generous and my shape as true as honest madam issue why brand they us with base with baseness bastardy base base who in the lusty stealth of nature take more composition and fierce quality than doth within a dull stale tired bed go to the creating a whole tribe of fops got ween asleep and wake well then legitimate edgar i must have your land our father love is to the bastard edmund as to the legitimate fine word egitimate well my legitimate if this letter speed and my invention thrive edmund the base shall top the legitimate i grow i prosper now gods stand up for bastards kent banish thus and france in choler parted and the king gone toight subscribed his power confined to exhibition all this done upon the gad edmund how now what news so please your lordship none why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter i know no news my lord what paper were you reading nothing my lord no what needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself let see come if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles i beseech you sir pardon me it is a letter from my brother that i have not all oread and for so much as i have perused i find it not fit for your orooking give me the letter sir i shall offend either to detain or give it the contents as in part i understand them are to blame let see let see i hope for my brother justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue read his policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered come to me that of this i may speak more if our father would sleep till i waked him you should half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your brother edgar hum onspiracy leep till i waked him ou should enjoy half his revenue y son edgar had he a hand to write this a heart and brain to breed it in hen came this to you who brought it it was not brought me my lord there the cunning of it i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet you know the character to be your brother if the matter were good my lord i durst swear it were his but in respect of that i would fain think it were not it is his it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is not in the contents hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business never my lord but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue o villain villain his very opinion in the letter abhorred villain unnatural detested brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah seek him il apprehend him abominable villain where is he i do not well know my lord if it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent you shall run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honour and to no further pretence of danger think you so if your honour judge it meet i will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening he cannot be such a monster nor is not sure to his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him heaven and earth edmund seek him out wind me into him i pray you frame the business after your own wisdom i would unstate myself to be in a due resolution i will seek him sir presently convey the business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked wixt son and father this villain of mine comes under the prediction there son against father the king falls from bias of nature there father against child we have seen the best of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves find out this villain edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it carefully and the noble and trueearted kent banished his offence honesty is strange this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune ften the surfeit of our own behavior e make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains by necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star my father compounded with my mother under the dragon tail and my nativity was under ursa major so that it follows i am rough and lecherous tut i should have been that i am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing edgar and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue is villanous melancholy with a sigh like tom o bedlam o these eclipses do portend these divisions fa sol la how now brother edmund what serious contemplation are you in i am thinking brother of a prediction i read this other day what should follow these eclipses do you busy yourself about that i promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches and i know not what how long have you been a sectary astronomical come come when saw you my father last why the night gone by spake you with him ay two hours together parted you in good terms found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance none at all bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay some villain hath done me wrong that my fear i pray you have a continent forbearance till the spied of his rage

i see the business let me if not by birth have lands by wit all with me meet that i can fashion fit did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool yes madam by day and night he wrongs me every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds il not endure it his knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us on every trifle when he returns from hunting i will not speak with him say i am sick if you come slack of former services you shall do well the fault of it il answer he coming madam i hear him put on what weary negligence you please you and your fellows il have it come to question if he dislike it let him to our sister whose mind and mine i know in that are one not to be overuled idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given

well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter ha sayest thou so i beseech you pardon me my lord if i be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when i think your highness wronged thou but rememberest me of mine own conception i have perceived a most faint neglect of late which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of

grown foppish they know not how their wits to wear their manners are so apish when were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah i have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers for when thou gavest them the rod and putt down thine own breeches then they for sudden joy did weep and i for sorrow sung that such a king should play boeep and go the fools among prithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie i would fain learn to lie an you lie sirrah wel have you whipped i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are theyl have me whipped for speaking true
