just to please my mother nothing on earth would induce me to marry lord connemara for example ernest looked at her and smiled but said nothing lady hilda put in a stroke or two more to her pencil outline and then continued her unsolicited confidences o you know mr le breton she went on here a conspiracy he usual conspiracy but still a regular conspiracy i call it etween papa and mamma to make me marry that stick of a connemara what is there in him i should like to know to make any girl admire or love him and yet half the girls in london would be glad to get him for all his absurdity it monstrous it incomprehensible it abominable but it the fact for my part i must say i do like a little originality and whenever i hear papa and uncle sussex and lord connemara talking at dinner it does seem to me too ridiculously absurd that they should each have a separate voice in parliament and that you shouldn even have a fraction of a vote for a county member what sort of superiority has lord connemara over you i wonder and she looked at ernest again with a searching glance to see whether he was to be moved by such a personal and emphatic way of putting the matter ernest looked back at her curiously in his serious simplicity and only answered here are a great many queer inequalities and absurdities in all our existing political systems lady hilda hilda smiled to herself quiet smile half of disappointment half of complacent feminine superiority what a stupid fellow he was in some ways after all even that silly lord connemara would have guessed what she was driving at with only a quarter as much encouragement but ernest must be too much afraid of the social barrier clearly so she began again this time upon a slightly different but equally obvious tack es there are absurd inequalities really mr le breton very absurd inequalities you get rid of them all i know you told me that about cutting all the landlords heads off i sure though you said when i spoke about it before mamma the night you first came here that you didn mean it i remember it perfectly well because i recollect thinking at the time the idea was so charmingly and deliciously original ou must be quite mistaken lady hilda ernest answered calmly ou misunderstood my meaning i said i would get rid of landlords y which i meant to say get rid of them as landlords not as individuals i don even know that i take away the land from them all at once you know though i don think it justly their i deprive them of it tentatively and gradually ell i can see the justice of that i sure hilda answered carelessly ither the land ours by right or it isn ours if it ours you ought to leave it to us for ever and if it isn ours you ought to take it away from us at once and make it over to the people to whom it properly belongs why on earth should you keep them a day longer out of their own ernest laughed heartily at this vehement and uncompromising sansulottism oue a vigorous convert anyhow he said with some amusement see youe profited by my instruction youe put the question very plump and straightforward but in practice it would be better no doubt gradually to educate out the landlords rather than to dispossess them at one blow of what they honestly though wrongly imagine to be their own let all existing holders keep the land during their own lifetime and their heirs and resume it for the nation after their lives allowing for the rights of all children born of marriages between people now living ot at all hilda answered in a tone of supreme conviction in favour of simply cutting our heads off once for all and making our families pay all arrears of rent from the very beginning that or nothing put the case another way suppose mr le breton there was somebody who had got a grant from a king a long time ago allowing him to hang any three persons he chose annually well suppose this person and his descendants went on for a great many generations extorting money out of other people by threatening to kill them and letting them off on payment of a ransom suppose too they always killed three a year some time or other pour encourager les autres ust to show that they really meant it well then if one day the people grew wise enough to inquire into the right of these licensed extortioners to their black mail would you say don deprive them of it too unexpectedly let them keep it during their own lifetime let their children hang three of us annually after them but let us get rid of this fine old national custom in the third generation would that be fair to the people who would be hanged for the sake of old prescription in the interval do you think ernest laughed again at the serious sincerity with which she was ready to acquiesce in his economical heresies oue quite right he said he land is the people and there no reason on earth why they should starve a minute longer in order to let lord connemara pay three thousand guineas for spurious copies of early italian manuscripts and yet it would be difficult to get most people to see it i fancy lady hilda you must really be rather cleverer than most people score one thought hilda to herself nd whatever happens whether i marry a peer or a revolutionist i certainly won marry a fool glad you think so she went on aloud ecause i know your opinion worth having i should like to be clever mr le breton and i should like to know all about everything but what chance has one at dunbude do you know till you came here i never got any sensible conversation with anybody and she sighed gently as she put her head on one side to take a good view of her sketchy little picture lady hilda profile was certainly very handsome and she showed it to excellent advantage when she put her head on one side ernest looked at her and thought so to himself and lady hilda quick eye glancing sideways for a second from the paper noted immediately that he thought so r le breton she began again more confidentially than ever ne thing ie quite made up my mind to i won be tied for life to a stick like lord connemara in fact i won marry a man in that position at all i shall choose for myself and marry a man for the worth that in him i assure you it a positive fact ie been proposed to by no fewer than six assorted algies and berties and monties in a single season besides which some of them follow me even down here to dunbude papa and mamma are dreadfully angry because i won have any of them but i won i mean to wait and marry whoever i choose as soon as i find a man i can really love and honour she paused and looked hard at ernest can speak much plainer than that she thought to herself nd really he must be stupider than the algies and the monties themselves if he doesn see i want him to propose to me i suppose all women would say it awfully unwomanly of me to lead up to his cards in this way hrowing myself at his head they call it but what does that matter i won marry a fool and i will marry a man of some originality that the only thing in the world worth troubling one head about why on earth doesn he take my hand i wonder what further can he be waiting for lady hilda was perfectly accustomed to the usual preliminaries of a declaration and only awaited ernest first step to proceed in due order to the second strange to say her heart was actually beating a little by anticipation it never even occurred to her he belle of three seasons hat possibly ernest mightn wish to marry her so she sat looking pensively at her picture and sighed again quietly but ernest wholly unsuspicious only answered ou will do quite right lady hilda to marry the man of your own choice irrespective of wealth or station hilda glanced up at him curiously with a halfisdainful smile and was just on the point of saying ut suppose the man of my own choice won propose to me however as the words rose to her lips she felt there was a point at which even she should yield to convention and there were plenty of opportunities still before her without displaying her whole hand too boldly and immediately so she merely turned with another sigh this time a genuine one to her halfketched outline shall bring him round in time she said to herself blushing a little at her unexpected discomfiture shall bring him round in time i shall make him propose to me i don care if i have to live in a lodging with him and wash up my own teahings i shall marry him that i resolved upon he as mad as a march hare about his communism and his theories and things but i don care for that i could live with him in comfort and i couldn live in comfort with the algies and monties in fact i believe n a sort of way believe i almost in love with him i have a kind of jumpy feeling in my heart when i talking with him that i never feel when i talking with other young men even the nicest of them he not nice he a bear and yet somehow i should like to marry him r le breton she said aloud he sun all wrong for sketching toay and besides it too chilly i must run about a bit among the rocks t least i shall take his hand to help me she thought blushing ome and walk with me it no use trying to draw with one hands freezing and she crumpled up the unfinished sketch hastily between her fingers ernest jumped up to follow her and they spent the next hour scrambling up and down the clatter and talking on less dangerous subjects than lady hilda matrimonial aspirations till i shall make him ask me yet lady hilda thought to herself as she parted from him to go up and dress for dinner shall manage to marry him somehow or if i don marry him at any rate il marry somebody like him for it was really the principle not the person that lady hilda specially insisted upon chapter the daughters of canaan may beautiful may had brought the golden flowers and the trees in the valley behind the sleepy old town of calcombe pomeroy were decking themselves in the first wan green of their early spring foliage the ragged robins were hanging out pinky red from the hedgerows the cuckoo was calling from the copse beside the mill stream and the merry wee hedgearblers were singing lustily from the topmost sprays of hawthorn with their full throats bursting tremulously in the broad sunshine and ernest le breton too filled with the season had come down from dunbude for a fortnight holiday on his premised visit to his friend oswald or to say the truth more plainly to oswald pretty little sister edie for ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it was he had come for and he took the earliest possible opportunity of taking a walk with edie alone through the tiny glen behind the town where the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slowurning vanes of the overshot millheel et us sit down a bit on the bank here miss oswald he said to his airy little companion as they reached the old stone bridge that crosses the stream just below the millouse t such a lovely day one feels loath to miss any of it and the scenery here looks so bright and cheerful after the endless brown heather and russet bracken about dunbude not that exmoor isn beautiful in its way too devonshire is beautiful alike for that matter but then it more sombre and woody in the north and much less springike than this lovely quiet south devon country so glad you like calcombe edie said with one of her unfailing blushes at the indirect flattery to herself implied in praise of her native county nd you think it prettier than dunbude then do you rettier in its own way yes though not so grand of course everything here is on a smaller scale dunbude you know is almost mountainous nd the castle edie asked bringing round the conversation to her own quarter s that very fine at all like warwick or our dear old arlingford h it isn a castle at all really ernest answered nly a very big and ugly house as architecture it atrocious though it comfortable enough inside for a place of the sort nd the exmoors are they nice people what kind of girl is lady hilda now poor little edie she asked the question shyly but with a certain deep beating in her heart for she had often canvassed with herself the vague possibility that ernest might actually fall in love with lady hilda had he fallen in love with her already or had he not she knew she would be able to guess the truth by his voice and manner the moment he answered her no man can hide that secret from a woman who loves him yet it was not without a thrill and a flutter that she asked him for she thought to herself what must she seem to him after all the grand people he had been mixing with so lately at dunbude was it possible he could see anything in her a little country village girl coming to her fresh from the great ladies of that unknown and vaguely terrible society ady hilda ernest answered laughing nd as he said the words edie knew in her heart that her question was answered and blushed once more in her bewitching fashion ady hilda oh she a very queer girl indeed she not at all clever really but she has the one virtue of girls of her class heir perfect frankness she frank all over o reserve or reticence at all about her whatever she thinks she says without the slightest idea that youl see anything to laugh at or to find fault with in it in matters of knowledge she frankly ignorant in matters of taste she frankly barbaric in matters of religion she frankly heathen and in matters of ethics she frankly immoral r rather extraoral he added quickly correcting himself for the misleading expression shouldn think from your description she can be a very nice person edie said greatly relieved and pulling a few tall grasses at her side by way of hiding her interest in the subject he can be a really nice girl if she extraoral as you call it h i don mean she cut one throat or pick one pocket you know ernest went on quickly with a gentle smile he got a due respect for the ordinary conventional moralities like other people no doubt but in her case theye only social prejudices not genuine ethical principles i don suppose she ever seriously asked herself whether anything was right or wrong or not in her whole lifetime in fact i sure she never did and if anybody else were to do so she be immensely surprised and delighted at the startling originality and novelty of thought displayed in such a view of the question ut she very handsome isn she edie asked following up her inquiry with due diligence andsome oh yes in a bold sort of actress fashion very handsome but not to me at least pleasing i believe most men admire her a great deal but she lacks a feminine touch dreadfully she dashes away through everything as if she was hunting and she does hunt too which i think bad enough in anybody and horrible in a woman hen you haven fallen in love with her mr le breton i half imagined you would you know as i told she so very attractive allen in love with her miss oswald fallen in love with hilda tregellis what an absurd notion heaven forbid it hy so please hy in the first place what would be the use of it fancy lady exmoor horror at the bare idea of her son tutor falling in love with lady hilda i assure you miss oswald she would evaporate at the very mention of such an unheardf enormity a man must be if not an earl at least a baronet with five thousand a year before he dare face the inexpressible indignation of lady exmoor with an offer of marriage for lady hilda ut people don always fall in love by tables of precedence edie put in simply t quite possible i suppose for a man who isn a duke himself to fall in love with a duke daughter even though the duke her papa mayn personally happen to approve of the match however you don seem to think lady hilda herself a pleasant girl even apart from the question of lady exmoor requirements iss oswald ernest said looking at her suddenly as she sat half hiding her face with her parasol and twitching more violently than ever at the tall grasses iss oswald to tell you the truth i haven been thinking much about hilda tregellis or any of the other girls ie met at dunbude and for a very sufficient reason because ie had my mind too much preoccupied by somebody else elsewhere edie blushed even more prettily than before and held her peace half raising her eyes for a second in an enquiring glance at his and then dropping them hastily as they met in modest trepidation at that moment ernest had never seen anything so beautiful or so engaging as edie oswald die he said beginning again more boldly and taking her little gloved hand almost unresistingly in his die you know my secret i love you can you love me edie looked up at him shyly the tears glistening and trembling a little in the corner of her big bright eyes and for a moment she answered nothing then she drew away her hand hastily and said with a sigh r le breton we oughtn to be talking so we mustn don let us take me home please at once and don say anything more about it but her heart beat within her bosom with a violence that was not all unpleasing and her looks half belied her words to ernest keen glance even as she spoke them hy not edie he said drawing her down again gently by her little hand as she tried to rise hesitatingly hy not tell me ie looked into your face and though i can hardly dare to hope it or believe it i do believe i read in it that you really might love me h mr le breton edie answered a tear now quivering visibly on either eyelash on ask me please don ask me i wish you wouldn take me home won you ernest dropped her hand quietly with a little show of despondency that was hardly quite genuine for his eyes had already told him better hen you can love me miss oswald he said looking at her closely sorry for it very sorry for it but i grieved if i have seemed presumptuous in asking you this time the two tears trickled slowly down edie cheek ot very sad tears either nd she answered hurriedly h i don mean that mr le breton i don mean that you misunderstand me i sure you misunderstand me ernest caught up the trembling little hand again hen you can love me edie he said eagerly ou can love me edie answered never a word but bowed her head and cried a little silently ernest took the dainty wee gloved hand between his own two hands and pressed it tenderly he felt in return a faint pressure hen why won you let me love you edie he asked looking at the blushing girl once more h mr le breton edie said rising and moving away from the path a little under the shade of the big elmree t very wrong of me to let you talk so i mustn think of marrying you and you mustn think of marrying me consider the difference in our positions s that all ernest answered gaily h edie if that all it isn a very difficult matter to settle my position exactly nothing for ie got no money and no prospects and if i ask you to marry me it must be in the most strictly speculative fashion with no date and no certainty the only question is will you consent to wait for me till i able to offer you a home to live in it asking you a great deal i know and youe made me only too happy and too grateful already but if youl wait for me till we can marry i shall live all my life through to repay you for your sacrifice ut mr le breton edie said turning towards the path and drying her eyes quickly really don think you ought to marry me the difference in station is so great ven harry would allow the difference in station your father was a great man and a general and a knight you know and though my dear father is the best and kindest of men he isn anything of that sort of course a slight shade of pain passed across ernest face die he said lease don talk about that lease don my father was a just and good man whom i loved and honoured deeply if there anything good in any of us boys it comes to us from my dear father but please don speak to me about his profession it one of the griefs and troubles of my life he was a soldier and an indian soldier too and if there anything more certain to me than the principle that all fighting is very wrong and indefensible it the principle that our rule in india is utterly unjust and wicked so instead of being proud of my father profession much as i respected him i profoundly ashamed of it and it has been a great question to me always how far i was justified at all in living upon the pension given me for his indian services edie looked at him half surprised and half puzzled it was to her such an odd and unexpected point of view but she felt instinctively that ernest really and deeply meant what he said and she knew she must not allude to the subject again beg your pardon she said simply f ie put it wrong yet you know i can help feeling the great disparity in our two situations die said ernest looking at her again with all his eyes going to call you edie always now so that understood between us well i shall tell you exactly how i feel about this matter from the first moment i saw you i felt drawn towards you i felt that i couldn help admiring you and sympathising with you and loving you if i dared i would have spoken to you that day at iffley but i said to myself she will not care for me and besides it would be wrong of me to ask her just yet i had nothing to live upon and i oughtn to ask you to wait for me ou who are so pretty and sweet and good and clever ought to leave you free to your natural prospect of marrying some better man who would make you happier than i can ever hope to do so i tried to put the impulse aside i waited saying to myself that if you really cared for me a little bit you would still care for me when i came to calcombe pomeroy but then my natural selfishness overcame me ou can forgive me for it edie how could i help it when i had once seen you i began to be afraid some other man would be beforehand with you and i liked you so much i couldn bear to think of the chance that you might be taken away from me before i asked you all day long as ie been walking alone on those high grey moors at dunbude ie been thinking of you and at last i made up my mind that i must come and ask you to be my wife ome time henever we could afford to marry i know i asking you to make a great sacrifice for me it more than i have any right to ask you i ashamed of myself for asking it i can only make you a poor man wife and how long i may have to wait even for that i can say but if youl only consent to wait for me edie il do the best that lies in me to make you as happy and to love you as well as any man on earth could ever do edie turned her face towards his and said softly r le breton i will wait for you as long as ever you wish and i so happy oh so happy there was a pause for a few moments and then as they walked homeward down the green glen edie said with something more of her usual archness o after all you haven fallen in love with lady hilda do you know mr le breton i rather fancied at oxford you liked me just a little tiny bit but when i heard you were going to dunbude i said to myself ah now hel never care for a quiet country girl like me and when i knew you were coming down here to calcombe straight from all those grand ladies at dunbude i felt sure you be disenchanted as soon as you saw me and never think anything more about me hen you liked me edie ernest asked eagerly ou wanted me really to come to calcombe to see you f course i did mr le breton ie liked you from the first moment i saw you so glad ernest went on quickly believe all real love is love at first sight i wouldn care myself to be loved in any other way and you thought i might fall in love with lady hilda ell you know she is sure to be so handsome and so accomplished and to have had so many advantages that i have never had i was afraid i should seem so very simple to you after lady hilda h edie cried ernest stopping a moment and gazing at the little light airy figure only wish you could know the difference coming from dunbude to calcombe is like coming from darkness into light up there one meets with nobody but essentially vulgarinded selfish people eople whose whole life is passed in thinking and talking about nothing but dogs and horses and partridges and salmon racing and hunting and billiards and wines amusements amusements amusements all of them coarse and most of them cruel all day long their talk is just like the talk of grooms and gamekeepers in a publicouse parlour only a little improved by better english and more money will sondo win the derby what a splendid run we had with the west somerset on wednesday were you in at the death of that big fox at coulson corner ought the new vintages of madeira to be bottled direct or sent round the cape like the old ones capital burlesque at the gaiety but very slow at the lyceum who will go to the duchess of dorsetshire dance on the twentieth nd so forth for ever their own petty round of selfish pleasures from week end to week end o thought of anybody else no thought of the world at large no thought even of any higher interest in their own personalities their politics are just a selfish calculation of their own prospects and church capital privilege their religion when they have an is just a selfish regard for their own personal future welfare from the time i went to dunbude to this day ie never heard a single word about any higher thought of any sort don mean only about the troubles or the aspirations of other people but even about books about science about art about natural beauty they live in a world of amusing oneself and of amusing oneself in vulgar fashions s a born clown would do if he came suddenly into a large fortune the women are just as bad as the men only in a different way ot always even that for most of them think only of the fournand club and the pigeonhooting at hurlingham hings to sicken one now ie known selfish people before but not selfish people utterly without any tincture of culture i come away from dunbude and come down here to calcombe and the difference in the atmosphere makes one very breath come and go freer and i look at you edie and think of you beside lady hilda tregellis and i laugh in my heart at the difference that artificial rules have made between you i wish you knew how immeasurably her superior you are in every way the fact is it a comfort to escape from dunbude for a while and get down here to feel oneself once more in the only true sense of the word in a little good society while these things were happening in the bourne close palsied old miss luttrell mumbling and grumbling inarticulately to herself was slowly tottering down the steep high street of calcombe pomeroy on her way to the village grocer she shambled in tremulously to mrs oswald counter and seating herself on a high stool as was her wont laid herself out distinctly for a list of purchases and a good deliberate illatured gossip wo pounds of coffee if you please mrs oswald she began with a quaver offee mind i say not chicory your stuff always has the smallest possible amount of flavour in it it seems to me for the largest possible amount of quantity all chicory all chicory o decent coffee to be had now in calcombe pomeroy so your son at home this week is he out of work i suppose i saw him lounging about on the beach idling away his time yesterday pity he wasn at some decent trade instead of hanging about and doing nothing as if he was a gentleman five pounds of lump sugar too good lump sugar though i expect i shall get nothing but beetroot it all beetroot now my brother tells me theye ruined the west indies with their emancipation fads and their differential duties and the lord knows what e had estates in the west indies ourselves all given up to our negroes nowadays nd now i believe they have to pay the french a bounty or something of the sort to induce them to make sugar out of beetroot because the negroes won work without whipping so i understand that what comes in the end of your radical falal notions well five pounds of lump and five pounds of moist though the one as bad as the other really a great pity about your son i hope hel get a place again soon it must be a trial to you to have him so idle ell no mam it not mrs oswald answered with such selfestraint as she could command t not much of a trial to his father and me for wee glad to let him have a little rest after working so hard at oxford he works too hard mam but he gets compensation for it don e see miss luttrell for he just been made a fellow of the royal society for his mathematical eminence the times says fellow of the royal society even this staggering blow did not completely crush old miss luttrell ellow of the royal society she muttered feebly through her remaining teeth ust be some mistake somewhere mrs oswald uite impossible a very meritorious young man your son doubtless but a national schoolmaster hardly likely to be made a fellow of the royal society oh i remember you told me he not a national schoolmaster but has something to do at one of the oxford colleges yes yes i see what it is ellow of the royal geographical society you subscribe a guinea and get made a fellow by subscription just for the sake of writing f r g s after your name it gives a young man a look of importance o miss luttrell it isn that it the royal society and if youl wait a moment mam il fetch you the president letter and the diploma to let you see it h no occasion to trouble yourself mrs oswald the old lady put in almost with alacrity for she had herself seen the announcement of harry oswald election in the imes a few days before o occasion to trouble yourself i sure i daresay you may be right and at any rate it no business of mine thank heaven i never want to poke my nose into anybody else business well talking of oxford mrs oswald there a very nice young man down here at present i wonder if you know where he lodging i want to ask him to dinner he a young mr le breton ne of the cheshire le bretons you know his father was sir owen le breton a general in the indian army rother officer of major standish luttrell and very nice people in every way lady le breton a great friend of the archdeacon so i should like to show her son some little attention he had a very distinguished career at oxford our boy may have heard his name perhaps nd now he acting as tutor to lord lynmouth the eldest son of lord exmoor you know lady exmoor was a second cousin of my brother wife very nice people all of them the le bretons are a really good family you see and the archdeacon exceedingly fond of them so i thought if you could tell me where this young man is lodging ou shopeople pick up all the gossip in the place always ask him to dinner to meet the rector and colonel turnbull and my nephew who would probably be able to offer him a little shooting here no partridges about in may miss luttrell said mrs oswald quietly smiling to herself at the fancy picture of ernest seated in congenial converse with the rector colonel turnbull and young luttrell ut as to mr le breton i do happen to know where he stopping though it not often that i know any calcombe gossip save and except what youe good enough to tell me when you drop in mam for mr le breton stopping here in this house with us mam this very minute n this house mrs oswald the old lady cried with a start wagging her unsteady old head this time in genuine surprise hy i didn know you let lodgings i thought you and your daughter were too much of fine ladies for that really i glad to hear it il leave a note for him o miss luttrell we don let lodgings mam and we don need to mrs oswald answered proudly r le breton stopping here as my son guest they were friends at oxford together and now that mr le breton has got his holiday like harry asked him down to spend a fortnight at calcombe pomeroy and if youl leave a note il be very happy to give it to him as soon as he comes in for he out walking now with harry and edith old miss luttrell sat for half a minute in unwonted silence revolving in her poor puzzled head what line of tactics she ought to adopt under such a very singular and annoying combination of circumstances stopping at the village grocer his was really too atrocious the le bretons were all as mad as hatters that she knew well all except the mother who was a sensible person and quite rational but old sir owen was a man with the most absurd religious fancies an interest in the souls of the soldiers quite right and proper of course in a chaplain but really too ridiculous in a regular field officer no doubt ernest le breton had taken up some equally extraordinary notions iberty equality fraternity and a general massacre probably and he had picked up harry oswald as a suitable companion in his revolutionary schemes and fancies there was no knowing what stone wall one of those mad le bretons might choose to run his head against still the practical difficulty remained ow could she extricate herself from this awkward dilemma in such a way as to cover herself with glory and inflict another bitter humiliation on poor mrs oswald if only she had known sooner that ernest was stopping at the oswalds she wouldn have been so loud in praise of the le breton family she would in that case have dexterously insinuated that lady le breton was only a halfay officer widow living on her pension and that her boys had got promotion at oxford as poor scholars through the archdeacon benevolent influence it was too late now however to adopt that line of defence and she fell back accordingly upon the secondary position afforded her by the chance of taking down mrs oswald intolerable insolence in another fashion h he out walking with your daughter is he she said maliciously ut walking with your daughter mrs oswald not with your son i saw her passing down the meadows half an hour ago with a strange young man and her brother stopped behind near the millpond a strange young man yes i noticed particularly that he looked like a gentleman and i was quite surprised that you should let her walk out with him in that extraordinary manner depend upon it mrs oswald when young gentlemen in mr le breton position go out walking with young women in your daughter position they mean no good by it hey mean no good by it take my advice mrs oswald and don permit it mr le breton a very nice young man and well brought up no doubt know his mother a woman of principle till young men will be young men and if your son goes bringing down his fine oxford acquaintances to calcombe pomeroy and you and your husband go flinging miss jemima er name jemima i think t the young men heads why then of course you must take the consequences ou must take the consequences and with this telling parthian shot discharged carefully from the shadow of the doorway accompanied by a running comment of shrugs nods and facial distortions old miss luttrell successfully shuffled herself out of the shop her list unfinished leaving poor mrs oswald alone and absolutely speechless with indignation ernest le breton never got a note of invitation from the squire sister but before nightfall all that was visitable in calcombe pomeroy had heard at full length of the horrid conspiracy by which those pushing upstart oswalds had inveigled a son of poor lady le breton down to stop with them and were now trying to ruin his prospects by getting him to marry their brazenaced hussey jemima edith when edie returned from her walk that afternoon mrs oswald went up into her bedroom to see her daughter she knew at once from edie radiant blushing face and moist eyes what had taken place and she kissed the pretty shrinking girl tenderly on her forehead die darling i hope you will be happy she whispered significantly hen you guess it all mother dear asked edie relieved that she need not tell her story in set words es darling said the mother kissing her again nd you said yes edie coloured once more said yes mother for i love him dearly e a dear fellow the mother answered gently nd i sure hel do his best to make you happy later on in the day harry came up and knocked at edie door his mother had told him all about it and so had ernest opsy he said kissing her also congratulate you i so glad about it le breton the best fellow i know and i couldn wish you a better or a kinder husband youl have to wait for him but he worth waiting for he a good fellow and a clever fellow and an affectionate fellow and his family are everything that could be desired itl be a splendid thing for you to be able to talk in future about my mothern law lady le breton depend upon it edie dear that always counts for something in society edie blushed again but this time with a certain tinge of shame and disappointment she had never thought of that herself and she was hurt that harry should think and speak of it at such a moment she felt with a sigh it was unworthy of him and unworthy of the occasion truly the iron of pi and its evaluations had entered deeply into his soul chapter culture and culture wonder berkeley said herbert le breton examining a coin curiously hat on earth can ever have induced you with your ideas and feelings to become a parson y dear le breton your taste like good wine improves with age answered berkeley coldly here are many reasons any one of which may easily induce a sensible man to go into the church for example he may feel a disinterested desire to minister to the souls of his poorer neighbours or he may be first cousin to a bishop or he may be attracted by an ancient and honourable national institution or he may possess a marked inclination for albs and chasubles or he may reflect upon the distinct social advantages of a good living or he may have nothing else in particular to do or he may simply desire to rouse the impertinent curiosity of all the indolent quidnuncs of his acquaintance without the remotest intention of ever gratifying their underbred paul pry proclivities herbert le breton winced a little e felt he had fairly laid himself open to this unmitigated rebuff ut he did not retire immediately from his untenable position suppose he said quietly here are still people who really do take a practical interest in other people souls y brother ronald does for one ut the idea is positively too ridiculous whenever i read any argument upon immortality it always seems to me remarkably cogent if the souls in question were your soul and my soul but just consider the transparent absurdity of supposing that every hodge chawbacon and every rheumatic old betty martin has got a soul too that must go on enduring for all eternity the notion absolutely ludicrous what an infinite monotony of existence for the poor old creatures to endure for ever eing bored by their own inane personalities for a million aeons it simply appalling to think of but berkeley wasn going to be drawn into a theological discussion hat was a field which he always sedulously and successfully avoided he immortality of the soul he said quietly s a platonic dogma too frequently confounded even by moderately instructed persons like yourself le breton with the church very different doctrine of the resurrection of the body upon this latter subject my dear fellow about which you don seem to be quite clear or perfectly sound in your views youl find some excellent remarks in bishop pearson on the creed valuable work which i had the pleasure of studying intimately for my ordination examination eally berkeley youe the most incomprehensible and mysterious person i ever met in my whole lifetime said herbert dryly believe you take a positive delight in deceiving and mystifying one do you seriously mean to tell me you feel any interest at the present time of day in books written by bishops modern bishop berkeley answered calmly s an unpicturesque but otherwise estimable member of a very distinguished ecclesiastical order who ought not lightly to be brought into ridicule by lewd or lay persons on that ground i have always been in favour myself of gradually reforming his hat his apron and even his gaiters which doubtless serve to render him at least conspicuous if not positively absurd in the irreverent eyes of a ribald generation but as to criticising his literary or theological productions my dear fellow that would be conduct eminently unbecoming in a simple curate and savouring of insubordination even in the person of an elderly archdeacon i decline therefore to discuss the subject especially with a layman on whose orthodoxy i have painful doubts here oswald is he up yet o he down in devonshire my brother ernest writes me hat at dunbude what oswald doing there h dear no not at dunbude the peerage hasn yet adopted him t a place called calcombe pomeroy where it seems he lives ernest has gone down there from exmoor for a fortnight holiday you remember oswald has a pretty sister met her here in your rooms last october in fact nd i apprehend she may possibly form a measurable portion of the local attractions a pretty face goes a long way with some people berkeley drew a deep breath and looked uneasily out of the window this was dangerous news indeed what little miss butterfly has the boy with the gauze net caught sight of you already will he trap you and imprison you so soon in his little gilded matrimonial cage enticing you thereinto with soft words and sugared compliments to suit your dainty delicate palate and must i who have meant to chase you for the chief ornament of my own small cabinet be only in time to see you pinioned and cabined in your white lace veils and other pretty disguised entanglements for his special and particular delectation this must be looked into miss butterfly this must be prevented off to calcombe pomeroy then or other parts unknown this very next toorrow and let us fight out the possession of little miss butterfly with our two gauze nets in opposition ine tricked as prettily as i can trick it with tags and ends of artllurements and hummed to in a delicate tune efore this interloping anticipating le breton has had time to secure you absolutely for himself too austere for you little miss butterfly good in his way and kindly meaning but too austere better come and sun yourself in the modest wee palace of art that i mean to build myself some day in some green sunny sloping valley where your flittings will not be rudely disturbed by breath of poverty nor your pretty feathery wings ruthlessly clipped with a pair of doctrinaire ethicoocialistic scissors to calcombe then to calcombe nd not a day delay before i get there so much of thought in his own quaint indefinite fashion flitted like lightning through arthur berkeley perturbed mind as he stood gazing wistfully for one second out of his pretty latticed creeperlad window then he remembered himself quickly with a short little sigh and turned to answer herbert le breton last halfneering innuendo omething more than a pretty face merely he said surveying herbert coldly from head to foot heart too and a mind for all her flitting not wholly unfurnished with good sensible solid mahogany english furniture you may be sure harry oswald sister isn likely to be wanting in wits at any rate swald a curious fellow herbert went on changing the venue as he always did when he saw berkeley was really in earnest e very clever certainly but he can never outlive his bourgeois origin the smell of tea sticks about him somehow to the end of the chapter don you know berkeley there are some fellows whose clothes seem to have been born with them they fit so perfectly and impede their movement so little while there are other fellows whose clothes look at once as if they been made for them by a highly respectable but imperfectly successful tailor that just what i always think about harry oswald in the matter of culture he got a great deal of culture the very best culture from the very best shop xford in fact ressed himself up in the finest suit of clothes from the most fashionable mental tailor but it doesn seem to fit him naturally he moves about in it uneasily like a man unaccustomed to be clothed by a good workman he looks in his mental upholstery like a greengrocer in evening dress now there all the difference in the world between that sort of putn culture and culture in the grain isn there you may train up a grocer son to read dante and to play mendelssohn lieder and to admire fra angelico but you can train him up to wear these things lightly and gracefully upon him as you and i do who come by them naturally we are born to the sphere he rises to it ou think so le breton asked the curate with a quiet and suppressed smile as he thought silently of the placid old shoemaker hink so my dear fellow i sure of it i can spot a man of birth from a man of mere exterior polish any day anywhere talk as much nonsense as you like about all men being born free and equal heye not theye born with natural inequalities in their very nerve and muscle when i was an undergraduate i startled one of the tutors of that time by beginning my english essay once all men are by nature born free and unequal i stick to it still it the truth they say it takes three generations to make a gentleman nonsense utterly it takes at least a dozen you can work out the common fibre in such a ridiculous hurry that results as a simple piece of deductive reasoning from all modern theories of heredity and variation agree with you in part le breton the parson said eyeing him closely n part but not altogether what you say about oswald very largely true his culture sits upon him like a suit made to order not like a skin in which he was born but don you think that due more to the individual man than to the class he happens to belong to it seems to me there are other men who come from the same class as oswald or even from lower classes but whose culture is just as much ingrained as say my dear fellow yours is they were born no doubt of naturally cultivated parents and that how your rule about the dozen generations that go to make a gentleman comes really true i believe myself it takes a good many generations but then none of them need have been gentlemen in the ordinary sense of the word before him a gentleman if i to use the expression as implying the good qualities conventionally supposed to be associated with it a gentleman may be the final outcome and efflorescence of many past generations of quiet unobtrusive workingan culture on you think so herbert le breton smiled incredulously don know that i do quite he answered languidly confess i attach more importance than you do to the mere question of race and family a thoroughbred differs from a cartorse and a greyhound from a vulgar mongrel in mind and character as well as in body oswald seems to me in all essentials a bourgeois at heart even now ut remember berkeley said rather warmly for him he bourgeois class in england is just the class which must necessarily find it hardest to throw off the ingrained traces of its early origin it has intermarried for a long time ong enough to have produced a distinct racial type like those you speak of among dogs and horses he philistine type in fact nd when it tries to emerge it must necessarily fight hard against the innate philistinism of which it is conscious in its own constitution no class has had its inequality with others its natural inferiority so constantly and cruelly thrust in its face certainly the workingan has not the workingan who makes efforts to improve himself is encouraged the workingan who rises is taken by the hand the workingan whatever he does is never sneered at but it very different with the shopkeeper naturally a little prone to servility hat comes from the very necessities of the situation nd laudably anxious to attain the level of those he considers his superiors he gets laughed at on every hand being the next class below society society is always engaged in trying to keep him out and keep him down on the other hand he naturally forms his ideal of what is fine and worth imitating from the example of the class above him and therefore considering what that class is he has unworthy aims and snobbish desires either in his own person or in the persons of his near relations the wholesale merchant and the manufacturer bourgeois alike e supplies the mass of nouveaux riches who are the pet laughingtock of all our playwrights and novelists and comic papers so the bourgeois who really knows he has something in him like harry oswald feels from the beginning painfully conscious of the instability of his position and of the fact that men like you are cutting jokes behind his back about the smell of tea that still clings to him that a horrible drag to hold a man back he sense that he must always be criticised as one of his own class nd that a class with many recognised failings it makes him selfonscious and i believe selfonsciousness is really at the root of that slight social awkwardness you think you notice in harry oswald a workingan son need never feel that i feel sure there are workingen sons who go through the world as gentlemen mixing with gentlemen and never give the matter of their birth one moment serious consideration their position never troubles them and it never need trouble them put it to yourself now le breton suppose i were to tell you my father was a working shoemaker for example or a working carpenter you never think anything more about it but if i were to tell you he was a grocer or a baker or a confectioner or an ironmonger you feel a certain indefinable class barrier set up between us two immediately and ever after isn it so now erhaps it is herbert answered dubitatively ut as he probably neither the one nor the other the hypothesis isn worth seriously discussing i must go off now ie got a lecture at twelve goodye don forget the tickets for thursday concert arthur berkeley looked after him with a contemptuous smile he outcome of a race himself he thought nd not the best side of that race either i was half tempted in the heat of argument to blurt out to him the whole truth about the dear gentle old progenitor but i glad i didn now after all it no use to cast your pearls before swine for herbert essentially a pig selfish selfentred pig no doubt a very refined and cultivated specimen of pigdom he best breed but still a most emphatic and consummate pig for all that not the same stuff in him that there is in ernest fibre or two wanting somewhere but i mustn praise ernest rival a rival it war to the death between us two now and no quarter he a good fellow and i like him dearly but all fair in love and war and i must go down to calcombe toorrow morning and forestall him immediately dear little miss butterfly is for your sake you shall not be pinched and cramped to suit the procrustean measure of ernest le breton communistic fancies you shall fly free in the open air and flash your bright silken wings decked out bravely in scales of many hues not toned down to too sober and quakerike a suit of drab and doveolour you were meant by nature for the sunshine and the summer you shall not be worried and chilled and killed with doses of heterodox political economy and controversial ethics better even a country rectory though with a bad late perpendicular churc and flowers and picnics and lawnennis and village smallalk and the squire dinnerarties than bread and cheese and virtuous poverty in a london lodging with ernest le breton romance lives again the beautiful maiden is about to be devoured by a goggleyed monster labelled on the back experimental socialism the red cross knight flies to her aid and drives away the monster by his magic music lance in rest lyre at side third class railway ticket in pocket a berkeley to the rescue and there you have it and as he spoke he tilted with his pen at an imaginary dragon supposed to be seated in the crimson rockinghair by the wainscotted fireplace es i must certainly go down to calcombe no use putting it off any longer ie arranged to go next summer to london to keep house for the dear old progenitor the music is getting asked for two requests for more this very morning trade is looking up i shall throw the curacy business overboard what chance for modest merit that isn first cousin to a bishop in the church as at present constituted and take to composing entirely for a livelihood i wouldn ask miss butterfly before because i didn wish to tie her pretty wings prematurely but a rival that quite a different matter what right has he to go poaching on my preserves i should like to know and trying to catch the little gold fish i want to entice for my own private and particular fishond an interloper to be turned out unmercifully so off to calcombe and that quickly he sat down to his desk and taking out some sheets of blank musicaper began writing down the score of a little song at which he had been working so he continued till lunchime and then turning to the table when the scout called him took his solitary lunch of bread and butter with a volume of petrarch set open before him as he eat he was lazily englishing the soft lines of the original into such verse as suited his fastidious ear when the scout came in suddenly once more bringing in his hand the miday letters one of them bore the calcombe postmark trange berkeley said to himself t the very moment when i was thinking of going there an invitation perhaps the age of miracles is not yet past on they see spirits in a conjuror room in regent street rom oswald too by jove it must be an invitation and he ran his eye down the page rapidly to see if there was any mention of little miss butterfly yes there was her name on the second sheet what could her brother have to say to him about her e have ernest le breton down here now oswald wrote n a holiday from the exmoors and you may be surprised to hear that i shall probably have him sooner or later for a brothernaw he has proposed to and been accepted by my sister edith and though it is likely as things stand at present to be a rather long engagement for le breton has nothing to marry upo we are all very much pleased about it here at calcombe he is just the exact man i should wish my sister to marry so pleasant and good and clever and so very well connected felicitate us my dear berkeley arthur berkeley laid the letter down with a quiet sigh and folded his hands despondently before him he hadn seen very much of edie yet the disappointment was to him a very bitter one it had been a pleasant dayream truly and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly little miss butterfly he said to himself tenderly and compassionately airy flitting brightyed little miss butterfly i must give you up must i and ernest le breton must take you for better for worse must he la reyne le veult it seems and her word is law i afraid he hardly the man to make you happy little lady kindearted welleaning but too much in earnest too much absorbed in his ideas of right for a world where right impossible and every man for himself is the wretched sordid rule of existence he will overshadow and darken your bright little life i fear me not intentionally e couldn do that ut by his quixotic fads and fancies good fads honest fads but fads wholly impracticable in this jarring universe of clashing interests where he who would swim must keep his own head steadily above water and he who minds his neighbour must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom he will sink i doubt not poor little miss butterfly he will sink inevitably and drag you down with him down down down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair oh my poor little butterfly i sorry for you and sorry for myself it was a pretty dream and i loved it dearly i had made you a queen in my fancy and throned you in my heart and now i have to dethrone you again me miserable and have my poor lonely heart bare and queenless the piano was open and he went over to it instinctively strumming a few wild bars out of his own head made up hastily on the spur of the moment o not dethrone you he went on leaning back on the musictool and letting his hand wander aimlessly over the keys ot dethrone you i shall never never be able to do that little miss butterfly your image is stamped there too deep for dethronement stamped there for ever indelibly ineffaceably not to be washed out by tears or laughter ernest le breton may take you and keep you you are his you have chosen him and you have chosen in most things not unwisely for he a good fellow and true let me be generous in the hour of disappointment even to the rival the goggleyed impracticable dragon monstrosit but you are mine too for i won give you up i can give you up i must live for you still even if you know it not little woman i will work for you and i will watch over you i will be your earthly providence i will try to extricate you from the quagmires into which the welleaning shortighted dragon will infallibly lead you dear little bright soul my heart aches for you i know the trouble you are bringing upon yourself but la reyne le veult and it is not your humble servitor business to interfere with your royal pleasure still you are mine for i am yours yours body and soul what else have i to live for the dear old progenitor can be with us many years longer and when he is gone there will be nothing left me but to watch over little miss butterfly and her don quixote of a future husband a man can work and slave and compose sonatas for himself alone he idea disgusting piggish worthy only of herbert le breton i must do what i can for the little queen and for her balloonavigating utopian ernest thank heaven no law prevents you from loving in your own heart the one woman whom you have once loved no matter who may chance to marry her go dayream fly vanish evaporate the solid core remains still y heart and little miss butterfly i have loved her once and i shall love her i shall love her for ever he crumpled the letter up in his fingers and flung it half angrily into the wasteaper basket as though it were the embodied dayream he was mentally apostrophising it was sermonay and he had to write his discourse that very afternoon a quaint idea seized him ha he said almost gaily in his volatile irresponsible fashion have my text ready the hour brings it to me unsought a quip a quip i shall preach on the pool of bethesda while i am coming another steppeth down before me the verse seems as if it were made on purpose for me what a pity nobody else will understand it and he smiled quietly at the conceit as he got the scented sheets of sermonaper out of his little sandalwood davenport for arthur berkeley was one of those curiously compounded natures which can hardly ever be perfectly serious and which can enjoy a quaintness or a neat literary allusion even at a moment of the bitterest personal disappointment he could solace himself for a minute for the loss of edie by choosing a text for his sunday sermon with a prettilyurned epigram on his own position chapter the more excellent way at the very top of the winding footpath cut deeply into the sandstone side of the east cliff hill at hastings a wooden seat set a little back from the road invites the panting climber to rest for five minutes after his steep ascent from the primitive fisher village of old hastings which nestles warmly in the narrow sunmitten gulley at his feet on this seat one bright july morning herbert le breton lay at half length basking in the brilliant open sunshine and evidently waiting for somebody whom he expected to arrive by the side path from the all saints valley even the old coastguardsman plodding his daily round over to ecclesbourne noticed the obvious expectation implied in his attentive attitude and ventured to remark in his cheery familiar fashion he won be long aomin now sir you may depend upon it the gals is sure to be out early of a fine mornin like this re herbert stuck his double eyelass gingerly upon the tip of his nose and surveyed the bluff old sailor through it with a stony british stare of mingled surprise and indignation which drove the poor man hastily off with a few muttered observations about some people being so confounded stuck up that they didn even understand the point of a little goodatured seafarin banter as the coastguardsman disappeared round the corner of the flagstaff a young girl came suddenly into sight by the jutting edge of sandstone bluff near the high wickham and herbert jumping up at once from his reclining posture raised his bat to her with stately politeness and moved forward in his courtly graceful manner to meet her as she approached ell selah he said taking her hand a little warmly judged at least by herbert le breton usual standar o youe come at last ie been waiting here for you for fully half an hour you see ie come down to hastings again as i promised the very first moment i could possibly get away from my pressing duties at oxford the girl withdrew her hand from his blushing deeply but looking into his face with evident pleasure and admiration she was tall and handsome with a certain dashing air of queenliness about her too and she was dressed in a brave outspoken sort of finery which though cheap enough in its way was neither common nor wholly wanting in a touch of native good taste and even bold refinement of contrast and harmony t very kind of you to come mr walters she answered in a firm but delicate voice so sorry ie kept you waiting i got your letter and tried to come in time but father he been more aggravating than usual almost this morning and kept saying he like to know what on earth a young woman could want to go out walking for instead of stopping at home at her work and minding her bible like a proper christian in his time young women usen to be allowed to go walking except on sundays and then only to chapel or bible class so ie not been able to get away till this very minute with all this bundle of tracts too to give to the excursionists on the way father feels a most incomprehensible interest somehow in the future happiness of the sunday excursionists wish he feel a little more interest in the present happiness of his own daughter herbert said smiling ut it hasn mattered your keeping me waiting here selah of course i have enjoyed it all far better in your society don think i need tell you that now dear ut the sunshine and the sea breeze and the song of the larks and the plash of the waves below and the shouts of the fishermen down there on the beach mending their nets and putting out their smacks have all been so delightful after our humdrum round of daily life at oxford that i only wanted your presence here to make it all into a perfect paradise hy selah how pretty you look in that sweet print it suits your complexion admirably i never saw you wear anything before so perfectly becoming selah drew herself up with the conscious pride of an unaffected pretty girl so glad you think so mr walters she said playing nervously with the handle of her darklue parasol ou always say such very flattering things o not flattering herbert answered smiling ot flattering selah simply truthful you always extort the truth from me with your sweet face selah nobody can look at it and not forget the stupid conventions of ordinary society but please dear don call me mr walters call me herbert you always do you know when you write to me ut it so much harder to do it to your face mr walters selah said again blushing very time you go away i say to myself i shall call him herbert as soon as ever he comes back again and every time you come back i feel too much afraid of you the moment i see you ever to do it and yet of course i ought to you know for when wee married why naturally then i shall have to learn to call you herbert shan i ou will i suppose herbert answered rather chillily ut that subject is one upon which we shall be able to form a better opinion when the time comes for actually deciding it meanwhile i want you to call me herbert if you please as a personal favour and a mark of confidence suppose i were to go on calling you miss briggs all the time a pretty sort of thing that would be what inference would you draw as to the depth of my affection well now selah how have these dreadful home authorities of yours been treating you my dear girl all the time since i last saw you uch the same as usual mr walters erbert i mean selah answered hastily correcting herself he regular round prayers clean the shop breakfast with a chapter serve in the shop all morning dinner with a chapter serve in the shop all afternoon tea with a chapter prayer meeting in the evening supper with a chapter exhortation and go to bed sick of it all to get up next morning and repeat the entire performance da capo as they always say in the music to the hymnooks occasional relaxations unday at chapel three times and wednesday evening bible class mothers assembly dorcas society missionary meeting lecture on the holy land dissolving views of jerusalem and primitive methodist district conference in the mahanaim jubilee meeting hall salvation privileges every day and all the year round till i ready to drop with it and begin to wish i only been lucky enough to have been born one of those happy benighted little pagans in a heathen land where they don know the value of the precious sabbath and haven yet been taught to build primitive methodist district chapels for crushing the lives out of their sons and daughters herbert smiled a gentle smile of calm superiority at this vehement outburst of natural irreligion ou must certainly be bored to death with it all selah he said laughingly hat a funny sort of creed it really is after all for rational beings who on earth could believe that the religion these people use to render your life so absolutely miserable is meant for the same thing as the one that makes my poor dear brother ronald so perfectly and inexpressibly serene and happy the formalism of lower natures like your father has turned it into a machine for crushing all the spontaneity out of your existence what a r gime for a highpirited girl like you to be compelled to live under selah t is it is selah answered vehemently wish you could only see the way father goes on at me all the time about chapel and so on mr wal erbert i mean you wouldn wonder if you were to hear him at my being anxious for the time to come when you can leave oxford and we can get comfortably married what between the drudgery of the shop and the drudgery of the chapel my life positively getting almost worn out of me herbert took her hand in his quietly it was not a very small hand but it was prettily though cheaply gloved and the plain silver bracelet that encircled the wrist though simple and inexpensive was not wanting in rough tastefulness oue a bad philosopher selah he said turning with her along the path towards ecclesbourne oue always anxious to hurry on too fast the lagging wheels of an unknown future after all how do you know whether we should be any the happier if we were really and truly married don you know what swinburne says in dolores oue read it in the poems and ballads i gave you time turns the old days to derision our loves into corpses or wives and marriage and death and division make barren our lives e read it selah answered carelessly nd i thought it all very pretty of course swinburne always is very pretty but i sure i never try to discover what on earth he means by it i suppose father would say i don read him tearfully and prayerfully t any rate i quite sure i never understand what he driving at nd yet he worth understanding herbert answered in his clear musical voice ell worth understanding selah especially for you dearest if in imitation of obsolete fashions you wished to read a few verses of some improving volume every night and morning as a sort of becoming religious exercise in the elements of selfulture i don know that i could recommend you a better book to begin upon than the poems and ballads don you see the moral of those four lines ie just quoted to you why should we wish to change from anything so free and delightful and poetical as lovers into anything so fettered and commonplace and prosaic and banal as wives and husbands why should we wish to give up the fanciful paradise of fluttering hope and expectation for the dreary reality of housekeeping and cold mutton on mondays why should we not be satisfied with the real pleasure of the passing moment without for ever torturing our souls about the imaginary but delusive pleasure of the unrealisable impossible future ut we must get married some time or other herbert selah said turning her big eyes full upon him with a doubtful look of interrogation e can go on courting in this way for ever and ever without coming to any definite conclusion we must get married byndy now mustn we e vois pas la n cessit moi herbert answered with just a trace of cynicism in his curling lip don see any must about it that is to say in english selah the fact is you see i above all things a philosopher youe a philosopher too but only an instinctive one and i want to make your instinctive philosophy assume a rather more rational and extrinsic shape why should we really be in any hurry to go and get married do the actual married people of our acquaintance as a matter of fact seem so very much more ethereally happy ith their eight children to be washed and dressed and schooled daily for example han the lovers like you and me who walk armnrm out here in the sunshine and haven yet got over their delicious first illusions depend upon it the longer you can keep your illusions the better you haven read aristotle in all probability but as aristotle would put it it isn the end that is anything in loveaking it the energy the active pursuit the momentary enjoyment of it i suppose we shall have to get married some day selah though i don know when but i confess to you i don look forward to the day quite so rapturously as you do shall we feel more the thrill of possession do you think than i feel it now when i hold your hand in mine so and catch the beating of your pulse in your veins even through the fingers of your pretty little glove shall we look deeper into one another eyes and hearts than i look now into the very inmost depths of yours shall we drink in more fully the essence of love than when i touch your lips here ne moment selah the gorse is very deep here ow don be foolish h there what the use of philosophising tell me by the side of that come over here to the bench selah by the edge of the cliff look down yonder into ecclesbourne glen hear the waves dashing on the shore below and your own heart beating against your bosom within nd then ask yourself what the good of living in any moment in any moment but the present selah turned her great eyes admiringly upon him once more h herbert she said looking at him with a clever uneducated girl unfeigned and undisguised admiration for any cultivated gentleman who takes the trouble to draw out her higher self h herbert how can you talk so beautifully to me and then ask me why it is i longing for the day to come when i can be really and truly married to you do you think i don feel the difference between spending my life with such a man as you and spending it for years and years together with a ranting canting primitive methodist herbert smiled to himself a quiet unobtrusive selfatisfied smile he appreciates me he thought silently in his own heart he appreciates me at my true worth and after all that a great thing well selah he went on aloud toying unreproved with her pretty little silver bracelet et us be practical you belong to a business family and you know the necessity for being practical there a great deal to be said in favour of my hanging on at oxford a little longer i must get a situation somewhere else as soon as possible in which i can get married but i can give up my fellowship without having found something else to do which would enable me to put my wife in the position i should like her to occupy very small income would do for me with you herbert selah put in eagerly ou see ie been brought up economically enough heaven knows and i could live extremely well on very little ut i could not selah herbert answered in his colder tone ardon me but i could not ie been accustomed to a certain amount of comfort not to say luxury which i couldn readily do without and then you know dear he added seeing a certain cloud gathering dimly on selah forehead want to make my wife a real lady selah looked at him tenderly and gave the hand she hold in hers a faint pressure and then herbert began to talk about the waves and the cliffs and the sun and the great red sails and to quote shelley and swinburne and the conversation glided off into more ordinary everyday topics they sat for a couple of hours together on the edge of the cliff talking to one another about such and other subjects till at last selah asked the time hurriedly and declared she must go off at once or father be in a tearing passion herbert walked back with her through the green lanes in the golden mass of gorse till he reached the brow of the hill by the fisher village then selah said lightly ot any nearer herbert ou see i can say herbert quite naturally now he neighbours will go talking about it if they see me standing here with a strange gentleman goodye goodye till friday herbert held her face up to his in his hands and kissed her twice over in spite of a faint resistance then they each went their own way selah to the little greenrocer shop in a back street of the redrick fisher village and herbert to his big fashionable hotel on the marine parade in the noisy stuccoed modern watering place t an awkward sort of muddle to have got oneself into he thought to himself as he walked along the asphalte pavement in front of the seaall most confoundedly awkward fix to have got oneself into with a pretty girl of the lower classes she beautiful certainly that there no denying the handsomest woman on the whole i ever remember to have seen at any time anywhere and when i actually by her side hough it a weakness to confess it really not quite sure that i not positively quite in love with her she make a grand sort of messalina without a doubt a model for a painter with her frank imperious face and her splendid voluptuous figure a faustina a catherine of russia an ann boleyn o be fitly painted only by a rubens or a gustave courbet yet how i can ever have been such a particular fool as to go and get myself entangled with her i can imagine heredity heredity it must run in the family for certain there ernest has gone and handed himself over bodily to this grocer person somewhere down in devonshire and i myself who perfectly see the folly of his absurd proceeding have independently put myself into this very similar awkward fix with selah briggs here selah briggs indeed the very name reeks with commingled dissent vulgarity and greengrocery her father deacon of his chapel and goes out at night when there no missionary meeting on to wait at serious dinner parties or rather i suppose he desert the most enticing missionary to earn a casual halfrown at even an ungodly champagnerinking dinner then that the difference between me and ernest ernest selfish incurably and radically selfish because this oswald girl happens to take his passing fancy and to fit in with his impossible schurzian notions hel actually go and marry her not only will he have no consideration for mother ho really is a very decent sort of body in her own fashion if you don rub her up the wrong way or expect too much from her ut hel also interfere without a thought with my prospects and my advancement now that i call really selfish and selfishness is a vulgar piggish vice that i thoroughly abominate i don deny that i a trifle selfish myself of course in a refined and cultivated manner flatter myself in fact that introspective analysis is one of my strong points and i don conceal my own failings from my own consciousness with any weak girlish prevarications but after all as hobbes very well showed though our shallow modern philosophers pretend to laugh at hi selfishness in one form or another is at the very base of all human motives the difference really is between sympathetic and unsympathetic selfishness etween piggishness and cultivated feelings now i will not give way to the foolish and selfish impulses which would lead me to marry selah briggs i will put a curb upon my inclinations and do what is really best in the end for all the persons concerned nd for myself especially he strolled down on to the beach and began throwing pebbles carelessly into the plashing water es he went on in his internal colloquy can only account for my incredible stupidity in this matter by supposing that it depends somehow upon some incomprehensible hereditary leaning in the le breton family idiosyncrasy it awfully unlike me i will do myself the justice to say to have got myself into such a silly dilemma all for nothing it was all very well a few years ago when i first met selah i was an undergraduate in those days and even if somebody had caught me walking with a young lady of unknown antecedents and doubtful aspirates on the east cliff at hastings it really wouldn have much mattered she was beautiful even then hough not so beautiful as now for she grows handsomer every day and it was natural enough i should have taken to going harmless walks about the place with her she attracted me by her social rebelliousness nother family trait in me passive not active contemplative not personal but she certainly attracted me she attracts me still a man must have some outlet for the natural and instinctive emotions of our common humanity and if a monastic oxford community imposes celibacy upon one with mediaeval absurdity hy selah briggs is for the time being the only possible sort of outlet one needn marry her in the end but for the moment it is certainly very excellent fooling not unsentimental either or my part i could never care for mere coarse commonplace venal wretches indeed when i spoke to her just now about my wishing to make my wife a lady upon my word at the time i almost think i was just then quite in earnest the idea flitted across my mind vaguely why not send her for a year or two to be polished up at paris or somewhere and really marry her afterwards for good and always but on second thoughts it won hold water she magnificent she undeniable she admirable but she isn possible the name alone enough to condemn her fancy marrying somebody with a christian name out of the hundred and somethingth psalm it too atrocious i really couldn inflict her for a moment on poor suffering innocent society he paused awhile watching the great russet sails of the fishing vessels flapping idly in the breeze as the men raised them to catch the faint breath of wind and then he thought once more ut how to get rid of her that the question every time i come here now she goes on more and more about the necessity of our getting soon married nd i don wonder at it either for she has a perfect purgatory of a life with that snivelling methodistical father of hers one may be sure of it it would be awfully awkward if any oxford people were to catch me here walking with her on the cliff over yonder ome sniggering fellow of jesus or worcester for example or worse than all some prying young pecksniff of a thirdear undergraduate somehow she seems to fascinate me and i can get away from her but i must really do it and be done with it it no use going on this way much longer i must stop here for a few days more only and then tell her that i called away on important college business say to yorkshire or worcestershire or somewhere i needn tell her in person face to face i can write hastily at the last moment to the usual name at the post office o be left till called for and as a matter of fact i won go to yorkshire either ery awkward and undignified though these petty prevarications when a man once begins lowering himself by making love to a girl in an inferior position he lets himself in for all kinds of disagreeable necessities afterwards shall go to switzerland yes no place better after the bother of running away like a coward from selah in the alps one would forget all petty human degradations i shall go to switzerland of course i won break off with her altogether hat would be cruel and i really like her upon my word even when she isn by up to her own level i really like her but il let the thing die a natural death of inanition as they always put it in the newspapers with their stereotyped phraseology a gradual coldness shall intervene between us thatl be the best and only way out of it nd if i go to switzerland why not ask oswald of oriel to go with me that i fancy wouldn be a bad stroke of social policy ernest will marry this oswald girl unfortunately he as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the nile and as he going to drag her inevitably into the family i may as well put the best possible face upon the disagreeable matter let make a virtue of necessity the father and mother are old theyl die soon and be gathered to their fathers if they had an and the world will straightway forget all about them but oswald will always be there en vidence and the safest thing to do will be to take him as much as possible into the world and let the sister rest upon his reputation for her place in society it quite one thing to say that ernest has married the daughter of a country grocer down in devonshire and quite another thing to say that he has married the sister of oswald of oriel the distinguished mathematician and fellow of the royal society how beautifully that warm brown sail stands out in a curve against the cold grey line of the horizon bulging curve just like the swell of selah neck when she throws her head back so and lets you see the contour of her throat her beautiful rounded throat h that not giving her up now is it hat a confounded fool i am to be sure anybody would say if they could only have read my thoughts that moment that i was really in love with this girl selah chapter ye mountains of gilboa the old englischer hof at pontresina looked decidedly sleepy and misty at five olock on an august morning when two sturdy british holidayeekers in knickerbockers and regular alpine climbing rig sat drinking their parting cup of coffee in the salleanger before starting to make the ascent of the piz margatsch one of the tallest and by far the most difficult among the peaks of the bernina range there are few prettier villages in the engadine than pontresina and few better hotels in all switzerland than the old ivyovered englischer hof yet on this particular morning and at that particular hour it certainly did look just a trifle cold and cheerless e never makes very warm in the engadine carlo the waiter observed with a shudder in his best english to one of the two early risers nd he makes colder on an august morning here than he makes at nice in full december for poor carlo was one of those cosmopolitan waiters who follow the cosmopolitan tourist client le round all the spas health resorts kurs and winter quarters of fashionable europe in january he and his brother as charles and henri handed round absinthes and cigarettes at the cercle nautique at nice in april as carlo and enrico they turned up again with water ices and wafer cakes in the caff manzoni at milan and in august the observant traveller might recognise them once more under the disguise of karl and heinrich laying the table te in the long and narrow oldashioned diningoom of the englischer hof at pontresina though their native tongue was the patois of the canton ticino they spoke all the civilised languages of the world nd also german with perfect fluency and without the slightest attempt at either grammar or idiomatic accuracy and they both profoundly believed in their hearts that the rank wealth youth beauty and fashion of all other nations were wisely ordained by the inscrutable designs of providence for a single purpose to enrich and reward the active intelligent and industrious natives of the canton ticino re the guides come yet asked harry oswald of the waiter in somewhat feeble and hesitating german he made it a point to speak german to the waiters because he regarded it as the only proper and national language of the universal teutonic swiss people hey await the gentlemans in the corridor answered carlo in his own peculiar and racy english for he on his side resented the imputation that any traveller need ever converse with him in any but that traveller own tongue provided only it was one of the recognised and civilised languages of the world or even german they are a barbarous and disgusting race those tedeschi look you well signor they address you as though you were the dust in the piazza yet even from them a polite and attentive person may confidently look for a modest a very modest but still a welcome trinkeld hen we better hurry up oswald said herbert le breton or guides are the most tyrannical set of people on the entire face of this planet i shall have another cup of coffee before i go though if the guides swear at me roundly in the best roumansch for it anyhow our acquaintance with the roumansch dialect being probably limited harry oswald answered he difference between their swearing and their blessing would doubtless be reduced to a vanishing point though ie noticed that swearing is really a form of human speech everywhere readily understanded of the people in spite of all differences of race or language one touch of nature you see and swearing after all is extremely natural re you ready asked herbert having tossed off his coffee es then come along at once i can feel the guides frowning at us through the partition they turned out into the street with its greenhuttered windows all still closed in the pale grey of early morning and walked along with the three guides by the high road which leads through rocks and firrees up to the beginning of the steep path to the piz margatsch passing the clear emeraldreen waterfall that rushes from under the lower melting end of the morteratsch glacier they took at once to the narrow track by the moraine along the edge of the ice and then to the glacier itself which is easy enough climbing as glaciers go for a good pedestrian herbert le breton the older mountaineer of the two got over the big blocks readily enough but harry less accustomed to swiss expeditions lagged and loitered behind a little and required more assistance from the guides every now and again than his sturdy companion getting rather blown at starting harry called out at last to herbert some yards in front of him o you think the despotic guide would let us sit down and rest a bit if we asked him very prettily him a cigar first herbert shouted back nd then after a short and decent interval prefer your request humbly in your politest french the savage potentate always expects to be propitiated by gifts as a preliminary to answering the petitions of his humble subjects see harry said laughing upply before grievances not grievances before supply and he halted a moment to light a cigar and to offer one to each of the two guides who were helping him along on either side thus mollified the senior guide grudgingly allowed ten minutes halt and a drink of water at the bend by the corner of the glacier they sat down upon the great translucent seareen blocks and began talking with the taciturn chief guide s this glacier dangerous harry asked angerous monsieur oh no not as one counts glaciers it is very safe there are seldom accidents ut there have been some ome naturally you don climb mountains always without accidents there was one the first time anyone ever made the ascent of the piz margatsch that was fifty years ago my uncle was killed in it illed in it harry echoed ow did it all happen and where onder monsieur in a crevasse that was then situated near the bend at the corner just where the great crevasse you see before you now stands that was fifty years ago since then the glacier has moved much its substance in effect has changed entirely ell us all about it herbert put in carelessly he knew the guide wouldn go on again till he had finished his whole story t a strange tale the guide answered taking a puff or two at his cigar pensively and then removing it altogether for his set narrative e had told the tale before a hundred times and he had the very words of it now regularly by heart t was the first time anyone ever tried to climb the piz margatsch at that time nobody in the valley knew the best path it is my father who afterwards discovered it two english gentlemen came to pontresina one morning one might say you two gentlemen but in those days there were not many tourists in the engadine the exploitation of the tourist had not yet begun to be developed my father and my uncle were then the only two guides at pontresina the english gentlemen asked them to try with them the scaling of the piz margatsch my uncle was afraid of it but my father laughed down his fears so they started my uncle was dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons and a pair of brown velvet breeches ah heaven i can see him yet his white corpse in the blue coat and the brown velvet breeches ut you can be fifty yourself harry said looking at the tall longimbed man attentively o nor forty nor thirty either o monsieur i am twentyeven the chief guide answered taking another puff at his cigar very deliberately nd this was fifty years ago yet i have seen his corpse just as the accident happened you shall hear all about it it is a tale from the dead it is worth hearing his begins to grow mysterious said herbert in english hammering impatiently at the ice with the shod end of his alpenstock ounds for all the world just like the introduction to a christmas number young girl in the village loved my uncle the guide went on imperturbably nd she begged him not to go on this expedition she was betrothed to him but he wouldn listen and they all started together for the top of the piz margatsch after many trials my father and my uncle and the two tourists reached the summit so you see andreas said my father your fears were all folly halfay through the forest said my uncle one is not yet safe from the wolf then they began to descend again they got down past all the dangerous places and on to this glacier so well known so familiar and then my uncle began indeed to get careless he laughed at his own fears cathrein was all wrong he said to my father we shall get down again safely with our lady assistance so they reached at last the great crevasse my father and one of the englishmen got over without difficulty but the other englishman slipped his footing failed him and he was sinking sinking down down down slipping quickly into the deep dark green abyss below my uncle stretched out his hand over the edge the englishman caught it and then my uncle missed his foothold they both fell together and were lost to sight at once completely in the invisible depths of the great glacier ell herbert le breton said as the man paused a moment s that all o the guide answered with a tone of deep solemnity hat is not all the glacier went on moving moving slowly slowly but always downward for years and years yet no one ever heard anything more of the two lost bodies at last one day when i was seven years old i went out playing with my brother among the pineoods near the waterfall that rushes below there from under the glacier we saw something lying in the iceold water just beneath the bottom of the iceheet we climbed over the moraine and there oh heaven we could see two dead bodies they were drowned just drowned we thought it might have been yesterday one of them was short and thicket with the face of an englishman he was closehaven and what seemed odd to us he had on clothes which though we were but children we knew at once for the clothes of a long past fashion n fact a suit of the louis dixuit style tha other was a tall and handsome man dressed in the unchangeable blue coat and brown velvet breeches of our own canton of the graubunden we were very frightened about it and so we ran away trembling and told an old woman who lived close by her name was cathrein and her grandchildren used to play with us though she herself was about the age of my father for my father married very late old cathrein came out with us to look and the moment she saw the bodies she cried out with a great cry it is he it is andreas it is my betrothed who was lost on the very day week when i was to be married i should know him at once among ten thousand it is many many years now but i have not forgotten his face h my god that face i know it well and she took his hand in hers that fair white young hand in her own old brown withered one and kissed it gently and yet she said he is five years older than me this fair young man here five years older than me we were frightened to hear her talk so for we said to ourselves she must be mad so we ran home and brought our father he looked at the dead bodies and at old cathrein and he said it is indeed true he is my brother ah monsieur you would not have forgotten it if you had seen those two old people standing there beside the fresh corpses they had not seen for all those winters they themselves had meanwhile grown old and grey and wrinkled but the ice of the glacier had kept those others young and fresh and fair and beautiful as on the day they were first engulfed in it it was terrible to look at most ghastly story indeed herbert le breton said yawning nd now i think we better be getting under way again hadn we oswald harry oswald rose from his seat on the block of ice unwillingly and proceeded on his road up the mountain with a distinct and decided feeling of nervousness was it the guide story that made his knees tremble slightly was it his own inexperience in climbing or was it the cold and the fatigue of the first ascent of the season to a man not yet in full pedestrian alpine training he did not feel at all sure about it in his own mind but this much he knew with perfect certainty that his footing was not nearly so secure under him as it had been during the earlier part of the climb over the lower end of the glacier byndy they reached the long sheer snowy slope near the three brothers this slope is liable to slip and requires careful walking so the guides began roping them together he stout monsieur in front next after me said the chief guide knotting the rope soundly round herbert le breton hen kaspar then you monsieur to harry oswald nd finally paolo to bring up the rear the thin monsieur is nervous i think it best to place him most in the middle f you really are nervous oswald herbert said not unkindly ou better stop behind i think and let me go on with two of the guides the really hard work you know has scarcely begun yet h dear no harry answered lightly he didn care to confess his timidity before herbert le breton of all men in the worl do feel just a little groggy about the knees i admit but it not nervousness it only want of training i haven got accustomed to glacierork yet and the best way to overcome it is by constant practice solvitur ambulando you know as aldrich says about achilles and the tortoise ery good herbert answered drily nly mind whatever you do for heaven sake don go and stumble and pull me down on the top of you it the clear duty of a good citizen to respect the lives of the other men who are roped together with him on the side of a mountain they set to work again in single file with cautious steps planted firmly on the treacherous snow to scale the great white slope that stretched so temptingly before them harry felt his knees becoming at every step more and more ungovernable while herbert didn improve matters by calling out to him from time to time ow then look out for a hard bit here or ind that loose piece of ice there or e very careful how you put your foot down by the yielding edge yonder and so forth at last they had almost reached the top of the slope and were just above the bare gulley on the side when harry insecure footing on a stray scrap of ice gave way suddenly and he began to slip rapidly down the sheer slope of the mountain in a second he had knocked against paolo and paolo had begun to slip too so that both were pulling with all their weight against kaspar and the others in front or heaven sake man herbert cried hastily ig your alpenstock deep into the snow at the same instant the chief guide shouted in roumansch to the same effect to kaspar but even as they spoke kaspar pushing his feet hard against the snow began to give way too and the whole party seemed about to slip together down over the sheer rocky precipice of the great gulley on the right it was a moment of supreme anxiety but herbert le breton looking back with blood almost unstirred and calmly observant eye saw at once the full scope of the threatening danger here only one chance he said to himself quietly swald is lost already unless the rope breaks we are all lost together at that very second harry oswald throwing his arms up wildly had reached the edge of the terrible precipice he went over with a piercing cry into the abyss with the last guide beside him and kaspar following him close in mute terror then herbert le breton felt the rope straining straining straining upon the sharp frozen edge of the rock for an inappreciable point of time it strained and crackled one loud snap and it was gone for ever herbert and the chief guide almost upset by the sudden release from the heavy pull that was steadily dragging them over threw themselves flat on their faces in the drifted snow and checked their fall by a powerful muscular effort the rope was broken and their lives were saved but what had become of the three others they crept cautiously on hands and knees to the most practicable spot at the edge of the precipice and the guide peered over into the great white blank below with eager eyes of horrid premonition as he did so he recoiled with awe and made a rapid gesture with his hands half prayer half speechless terror hat do you see asked herbert not daring himself to look down upon the blank beneath him lest he should be tempted to throw himself over in a giddy moment esu maria cried the guide crossing himself instinctively over and over again hey have all fallen to the very foot of the second precipice they are lying all three huddled together on the ledge there just above the great glacier they are dead quite dead dead before they reached the ground even great god it is too terrible herbert le breton looked at the whiteaced guide with just the faintest suspicion of a sneering curl upon his handsome features the excitement of the danger was over now and he had at once recovered his usual philosophic equanimity uite dead he said in french uite dead are they then we can be of any further use to them but i suppose we must go down again at once to help recover the dead bodies the guide gazed at him blankly with simple openouthed undisguised amazement aturally he said in a very quiet voice of utter disgust and loathing ou wouldn leave them lying there alone on the cold snow would you his is really most annoying thought herbert le breton to himself in his rational philosophic fashion ere we are almost at the summit and now we shall have to turn back again from the very threshold of our goal without having seen the view for which wee climbed up and risked our lives too for a purely sentimental reason because we won leave those three dead men alone on the snow for an hour or two longer it a very short climb to the top now and i could manage it by myself in twenty minutes if only the chief guide had slid over with the others i should have gone on alone and had the view at least for my trouble i could have pretended the accident happened on the way down again as it is i shall have to turn back ingloriously re infecta the guide will tell everybody at pontresina that i went on in spite of the accident and then it would get into the english papers and all the world would say that i was so dreadfully cruel and heartless people are always so irrational in their ethical judgments oswald quite dead that certain nobody could fall over such a precipice as that without being killed a dozen times over before he even reached the bottom a very painless and easy death too i couldn myself wish for a better one we can do them the slightest good by picking up their lifeless bodies and yet a foolishly sentimental public opinion positively compels one to do it poor oswald upon my soul i sorry for him and for that pretty little sister of his too but what the use of bothering about it the thing done and nothing that i can do or say will ever make it any better so they turned once more in single file down by the great glacier and retraced their way to pontresina without exchanging another word to say the truth the chief guide felt appalled and frightened by the presence of this impassive unemotional british traveller and did not even care to conceal his feelings but then he wasn an educated philosopher and man of culture like herbert le breton late that evening a party of twelve villagers brought back three stiff and mangled corpses on loose cattle hurdles into the village of pontresina two of them were the bodies of two local swiss guides and the third with its delicate face unscathed by the fall and turned calmly upwards to the clear moonlight was the body of harry oswald alas alas gilboa the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places chapter hat do these hebrews here from calcombe pomeroy ernest had returned not to dunbude but to meet the exmoor party in london there he had managed somehow e hardly knew how himself o live through a whole season without an explosion in his employer family that an explosion must come sooner or later he felt pretty sure in his own mind for several reasons his whole existence there was a mistake and an anomaly and he could no more in the end with the exmoor family than oil can with vinegar or vice vers the round of dances and dinners to which he had to accompany his pupil was utterly distasteful to him lynmouth never learnt anything so ernest felt his own function in the household a perfectly useless one and he was always on the eve of a declaration that he couldn any longer put up with this that or the other ross immorality in which lynmouth was actively or passively encouraged by his father and mother still there were two things which indefinitely postponed the smouldering outbreak in the first place ernest wrote to and heard from edie every day and he believed he ought for edie sake to give the situation a fair trial as long as he was able or at least till he saw some other opening which might make it possible within some reasonable period to marry her in the second place lady hilda had perceived with her intuitive quickness the probability that a cause of dispute might arise between her father and ernest and had made up her mind as far as in her lay to prevent its ever coming to a head she didn wish ernest to leave his post in the household o much originality was hardly again to be secured in a hurry nd therefore she laid herself out with all her ingenuity to smooth over all the possible openings for a difference of opinion whenever they occurred if ernest scruples were getting the upper hand of his calmer judgment lady hilda read the change in his face at once and managed dexterously to draw off lynmouth or to talk over her mother quietly to acquiesce in ernest view of the question if lord exmoor was beginning to think that this young man confounded fads were really getting quite unbearable lady hilda interposed some casual remark about how much better lynmouth was kept out of the way now than he used to be in mr walsh time ernest himself never even suspected this unobtrusive diplomatist and peacemaker but as a matter of fact it was mainly owing to lady hilda constant interposition that he contrived to stop in wilton place through all that dreary and penitential london season at last to ernest intense joy the season began to show premonitory symptoms of collapsing from inanition the twelfth of august was drawing nigh and the comingfge of grouse that most important of annual events in the orthodox british social calendar would soon set free lord exmoor and his brother hereditary legislators from their arduous duty of acting as constitutional drag on the general advance of a great tolerant and easyoing nation soon the family would be off again to dunbude or away to its other moors in scotland and among the rocks and the heather ernest felt he could endure lord exmoor and lord lynmouth a little more resignedly than among the reiterated polite platitudes and monotonous gaieties of the vacuous london drawingooms lady hilda too was longing in her own way for the season to be over she had gone through another of them thank goodness she said to herself at times with a rare tinge of pensiveness only to discover that the hughs and the guys and the algies and the montys were just as fatuously inane as ever and were just as anxious as before to make her share their fatuous inanity for a whole lifetime only fancy living with an unadulterated monty from the time you were twenty to the time you were seventyive t which latter date he being doubtless some five years older than oneelf to begin with would probably drop off quietly with suppressed gout and leave you a mourning widow to deplore his untimely and lamented extinction for the rest of your existence why long before that time you would have got to know his very thoughts by heart if he had any poor fellow and would be able to finish all his sentences and eke out all his stories for him the moment he began them much better marry a respectable porkutcher outright and have at least the healthful exercise of chopping sausageeat to fill up the stray gaps in the conversation in that condition of life they say people are at any rate perfectly safe from the terrors of ennui however the season was over at last thank heaven and in a week or so more they would be at dear old ugly dunbude again for the whole winter there hilda would go sketching once more on the moorland and if this time she didn make that stupid fellow ernest see what she was driving at why then her name certainly wasn hilda tregellis a day or two before the legal period fixed for the beginning of the general grouselaughter ernest was sitting reading in the breakfast room at wilton place when lynmouth burst unexpectedly into the room in his usual boisterous fashion h i say mr le breton he began holding the door in his hand like one in a hurry want leave to miss work this morning gerald talfourd has called for me in his dogart and wants me to go out with him now immediately ot toay lynmouth ernest answered quietly ou were out twice last week you know and you hardly ever get your full hours for work at all since we came to london h but look here you know mr le breton i really must go toay because talfourd has made an appointment for me it awful fun e going to have some pigeonhooting ernest countenance fell a little and he answered in a graver voice than before f that what you want to go for lynmouth i certainly can let you go you shall never have leave from me to go pigeonhooting hy not lynmouth asked still holding the doorandle at the most significant angle ecause it a cruel and brutal sport ernest replied looking him in the face steadily nd as long as youe under my charge i can allow you to take part in it h you can said lynmouth mischievously with a gentle touch of satire in his tone ou can can you very well then never mind about it and he shut the door after him with a bang and ran off upstairs without further remonstrance t time for study lynmouth ernest called out opening the door and speaking to him as he retreated ome down again at once please will you but lynmouth made no answer and went straight off upstairs to the drawingoom in a few minutes more he came back and said in a tone of suppressed triumph ell mr le breton i going with talfourd ie been up to papa and he says i may if i like to ernest bit his lip in a moment hesitation if it had been any ordinary question he would have pocketed the contradiction of his authority fter all if it didn matter to them it didn matter to him nd let lynmouth go wherever they allowed him but the pigeonhooting was a question of principle as long as the boy was still nominally his pupil he couldn allow him to take any part in any such wicked and brutal amusement as he thought it so he answered back quietly o lynmouth you are not to go i don think your father can have understood that i had forbidden you h lynmouth said again without a word of remonstrance and went up a second time to the drawingoom in a few minutes a servant came down and spoke to ernest y lord would like to see you upstairs for a few minutes if you please sir ernest followed the man up with a vague foreboding that the deferred explosion was at last about to take place lord exmoor was sitting on the sofa h i say le breton he began in his goodumoured way hat this that lynmouth been telling me about the pigeonhooting he says you won let him go out with gerald talfourd es ernest answered e wanted to miss his morning work and i told him i couldn allow him to do so ut i said he might if he liked le breton young talfourd has called for him to go pigeonhooting and now lynmouth tells me you refuse to let him go after ie given him leave is that so ertainly said ernest said he couldn go because before he asked you i had refused him permission and i supposed you didn know he was asking you to reverse my decision h of course lord exmoor answered for he was not an unreasonable man after his lights oue quite right le breton quite right certainly discipline discipline we all know and must be kept up under any circumstances you should have told me lynmouth that mr le breton had forbidden you to go however as young talfourd has made the engagement i suppose you don mind letting him have a holiday now at my request le breton do you here was a dilemma indeed for ernest he hardly knew what to answer he looked by chance at lady hilda seated on the ottoman in the corner and lady hilda catching his eye pursed up her lips visibly into the one word o but ernest was inexorable if he could possibly prevent it he would not let those innocent pigeons be mangled and slaughtered for a lazy boy cruel gratification that was the one clear duty before him and whether he offended lord exmoor or not he had no choice save to pursue it o lord exmoor he said resolutely after a long pause should have no objection to giving him a holiday but i can allow him to go pigeonhooting hy not asked lord exmoor warmly ernest did not answer e says it a cruel brutal sport papa lynmouth put in parenthetically in spite of an angry glance from hilda nd he won let me go while i his pupil lord exmoor face grew very red indeed and he rose from the sofa angrily o that it mr le breton he said in a short sharp fashion ou think pigeonhooting cruel and brutal do you will you have the goodness to tell me sir do you know that i myself am in the habit of shooting pigeons at matches es ernest answered without flinching a muscle es cried lord exmoor growing redder and redder ou knew that mr le breton and yet you told my son you considered the practice brutal and cruel is that the way you teach him to honour his parents who are you sir that you dare set yourself up as a judge of me and my conduct how dare you speak to him of his father in that manner how dare you stir him up to disobedience and insubordination against his elders how dare you sir how dare you ernest face began to get red in return and he answered with unwonted heat ow dare you address me so yourself lord exmoor how dare you speak to me in that imperious manner youe forgetting yourself i think and i had better leave you for the present till you remember how to be more careful in your language but lynmouth is not to go pigeonhooting i object to his going because the sport is a cruel and a brutal one whoever may practise it if i have any authority over him i insist upon it that he shall not go if he goes i shall not stop here any longer you can do as you like about it of course but you have my final word upon the matter lynmouth go down to the study top lynmouth cried his father boiling over visibly with indignation top never mind what mr le breton says to you do you hear me go out if you choose with gerald talfourd lynmouth didn wait a moment for any further permission he ran downstairs at once and banged the front door soundly after him with a resounding clatter lady hilda looked imploringly at ernest and whispered half audibly ow youe done it ernest stood a second irresolute while the earl tramped angrily up and down the drawingoom and then he said in a calmer voice hen would it be convenient lord exmoor that i should leave you henever you like lord exmoor answered violently oay if you can manage to get your things together this is intolerable absolutely intolerable gross and palpable impertinence in my own house too cruel and brutal indeed cruel and brutal fiddlesticks why it not a bit different from partridgehooting and he went out closely followed by ernest leaving lady hilda alone and frightened in the drawingoom ernest ran lightly upstairs to his own little study sittingoom e done it this time certainly as lady hilda said he thought to himself ut i don see how i could possibly have avoided it even now when all done i haven succeeded in saving the lives of the poor innocent tortured pigeons theyl be mangled and hunted for their poor frightened lives anyhow well now i must look out for that imaginary schoolmastership and see what i can do for dear edie i shan be sorry to get out of this after all for the place was an impossible one for me from the very beginning i shall sit down this moment and write to edie and after that i shall take out my portmanteau and get the man to help me put my luggage up to go away this very evening another day in the house after this would be obviously impossible at that moment there came a knock at the door timid tentative sort of knock and somebody put her head inquiringly halfway through the doorway ernest looked up in sudden surprise it was lady hilda r le breton she said coming over towards the table where ernest had just laid out his blottingook and writingaper couldn prevent myself from coming up to tell you how much i admire your conduct in standing up so against papa for what you thought was right and proper i can say how greatly i admire it i so glad you did as you did do you have acted nobly and hilda looked straight into his eyes with the most speaking and most melting of glances ow she said to herself to all correct precedents he ought to seize my hand fervently with a gentle pressure and thank me with tears in his eyes for my kind sympathy but ernest only looking puzzled and astonished answered in the quietest of voices hank you very much lady hilda but i assure you there was really nothing at all noble nothing at all to admire in what i said or did in any way in fact i rather afraid now i come to think of it that i lost my temper with your father dreadfully hen you won go away hilda put in quickly ou think better of it now do you youl apologise to papa and go with us to dunbude for the autumn do say you will please mr le breton h dear no ernest answered smiling quietly at the bare idea of his apologising to lord exmoor certainly won do that whatever i do to tell you the truth lady hilda i have not been very anxious to stop with lynmouth all along ie found it a most unprofitable tutorship o sense of any duty performed or any work done for society and i not at all sorry that this accident should have broken up the engagement unexpectedly at the same time it very kind of you to come up and speak to me about it though i really quite ashamed you should have thought there was anything particularly praiseworthy or commendable in my standing out against such an obviously cruel sport as pigeonhooting h but i do think so whatever you may say mr le breton hilda went on eagerly do think so and i think it was very good of you to fight it out so against papa for what you believe is right and proper for my own part you know i don see any particular harm in pigeonhooting of course it very dreadful that the poor dear little things should be shot and wounded and winged and so forth but then everything almost gets shot you see abbits and grouse and partridges and everything so that really it hardly worth while it seems to me making a fuss about it still that not the real question you think it wrong which is very original and nice and proper of you and as you think it wrong you won countenance it in any way i don care myself whether it wrong or not not called upon thank goodness to decide the question but i do care very much that you should suffer for what you think the right course of action and lady hilda in her earnestness almost laid her hand upon his arm and looked up to him in the most unmistakable and appealing fashion oue very good i sure lady hilda ernest replied half hesitatingly wondering much in his own mind what on earth she could be driving at there was a moment pause and then hilda said pensively nd so we shall never walk together at dunbude on the clatter any more mr le breton we shall never climb again among the big boulders on those devonshire hillsides we shall never watch the red deer from the big pool on top of the sheepalk i sorry for it mr le breton very sorry for it oh i do wish you weren going to leave us ernest began to feel that this was really growing embarrassing dare say we shall often see one another he said evasively for simpleinded as he was a vague suspicion of what lady hilda wanted him to say had somehow forced itself timidly upon him ondon a very big place no doubt but still people are always running together unexpectedly in it hilda sighed and looked at him again intently without speaking she stood so face to face with him across the table for fully two minutes and then seeming suddenly to awake from a reverie she started and sighed once more and turned at last reluctantly to leave the little study must go she said hastily amma would be very angry indeed with me if she knew i come here but i couldn let you leave the house without coming up to tell you how greatly i admire your spirit and how very very much i shall always miss you mr le breton will you take this and keep it as a memento as she spoke she laid an envelope upon the table and glided quietly out of the room ernest took the envelope up with a smile and opened it with some curiosity it contained a photograph with a brief inscription on the back b from hilda tregellis as he did so hilda tregellis red and pale by turns had rushed into her own room locked the door wildly and flung herself in a perfect tempest of tears on her own bed where she lay and tossed about in a burning agony of shame and selfity for twenty minutes e doesn love me she said to herself bitterly e doesn love me and he doesn care to love me or want to marry me either i sure he understood what i meant this time and there was no response in his eyes no answer no sympathy he like a block of wood cold impassive immovable lifeless creature and yet i could love him h if only he would say a word to me in answer how i could love him i loved him when he stood up there and bearded papa in his own drawingoom and asked him how dare he speak so how dare he address him in such a manner i knew then that i really loved him if only he would let me but he won to think that i could have half the algies and berties in london at my feet for the faintest encouragement and i can have this one poor penniless ernest le breton though i go down on my knees before him and absolutely ask him to marry me that the worst of it ie humiliated myself before him by letting him see oh ever so much too plainly that i wanted him to ask me and ie been repulsed rejected positively refused and slighted by him and yet i love him i shall never love any other man as i love ernest le breton poor lady hilda tregellis even she too had at times her sentimental moments and there she lay till her eyes were red and swollen with crying and till it was quite hopeless to expect she could ever manage to make herself presentable for the cecil faunthorpes gardenarty that afternoon at twickenham chapter evil tidings ernest had packed his portmanteau and ordered a hansom meaning to take temporary refuge at number epsilon terrace and he went down again for a few minutes to wait in the breakfastoom where he saw the imes lying casually on the little table by the front window he took it up half dreamily by way of having something to do and was skimming the telegrams in an unconcerned manner when his attention was suddenly arrested by the name le breton printed in conspicuous type near the bottom of the third column he looked closer at the paragraph and saw that it was headed to british tourists in switzerland a strange tremor seized him immediately could anything have happened then to herbert he read the telegram through at once and found this bald and concise summary before him of the fatal pontresina accident s mr h oswald f r s of oriel college oxford and mr le breton fellow and bursar of st aldate college along with three guides were making the ascent of the piz margatsch in the bernina alps this morning one of the party happened to slip near the great gulley known as the gouffre mr oswald and two of the guides were precipitated over the edge of the cliff and killed immediately the breaking of the rope at a critical moment alone saved the lives of mr le breton and the remaining guide the bodies have been recovered this evening and brought back to pontresina ernest laid down the paper with a thrill of horror poor edie how absolutely his own small difficulties with lord exmoor faded out of has memory at once in the face of that terrible irretrievable calamity harry dead the hope and mainstay of the family he one great pride and glory of all the oswalds on whom their whole lives and affections centred taken from them unexpectedly without a chance of respite without a moment warning worst of all they would probably learn it as he did for the first time by reading it accidentally in the curt language of the daily papers pray heaven the shock might not kill poor edie there was only a minute in which to make up his mind but in that minute ernest had fully decided what he ought to do and how to do it he must go at once down to calcombe pomeroy and try to lighten this great affliction for poor little edie nay lighten it he could not but at least he could sympathise with her in it and that though little was still some faint shade better than nothing at all how fortunate that his difference with the exmoors allowed him to go that very evening without a moment delay when the hansom arrived at the door ernest told the cabman to drive at once to paddington station almost before he had had time to realise the full meaning of the situation he had taken a thirdlass ticket for calcombe road and was rushing out of london by the plymouth express in one of the convenient and commodious little wooden horseoxes which the great western railway company provide as a wholesome deterrent for economical people minded to save half their fare by going third instead of first or second didcot swindon bath bristol exeter newton abbot all followed one after another and by the time ernest had reached calcombe road station he had begun to frame for himself a definite plan of future action he would stop at the red lion inn that evening send a telegram from exeter beforehand to edie to say he was coming next day and find out as much as possible about the way the family had borne the shock before he ventured actually to see them the calcombe omnibus drawn by two lean and weary horses toiled its way slowly up the long steep incline for six miles to the cross foxes and then rattled down the opposite slope steaming and groaning till it drew up at last with a sudden jerk and a general collapse in front of the old red lion inn in the middle of the high street there ernest put up for the present having seen by the shutters at the grocer shop on his way down that the oswalds had already heard of harry accident he had dinner by himself with a sick heart in the gloomy close little coffeeoom of the village inn and after dinner he managed to draw in the landlord in person for a glass of sherry and half an hour conversation ery sad thing sir this re causality in switzerland said the redaced landlord coming round at once to the topic of the day at calcombe after a few unimportant preliminary generalities oung mr oswald as has been killed he lived here sir leastways his parents do he was a very promising young gentleman up at oxford they do tell me ot much of a judge of horses i should say but still i understand quite the gentleman for all that very sad thing the causality sir for all his family ears he was climbing up some of these re alps they have over there in them parts covered with snow from head to foot in the manner of speaking and there was another gentleman from oxford with him a mr le breton y brother ernest put in interrupting him for he thought it best to let the landlord know at once who he was talking to h your brother sir said the redaced landlord with a gleam of recognition growing redder and hotter than ever ell now you mention it sir i find i remember your face somehow no offence sir but youe the young gentleman as come down in the spring to see young mr oswald aren you ernest nodded assent h well sir the landlord went on more freely or of course all calcombe had heard long since that ernest was engaged to edie oswald oue one of the family like in that case if i may make bold to say so well sir this is a shocking trouble for poor old mr oswald and no mistake the old gentleman was sort of centred on his son you see as the saying is never thought of nobody else hardly he didn old mr oswald sir was always a wonderful hand at figgers hisself and powerful fond of measurements and such kinds of things ie heard tell indeed as how he knew more mathematics and trigononomy and that than the rector and the schoolmaster both put together there not one in fifty as knows as much mathematics as he do il warrant well you see he brought up this son of his little harry as was can remember him now running to and from the school and figgerin away on the slates doin the sums in algemer for the other boys when they went aitchin e brought him up like a gentleman as you know very well sir and sent him to oxford college to develop his mathematical talents mr legge his father says to me here in this very parlour what the consequence he develops that boy talent sure enough sir till he comes to be a fellow of oxford college they tell me and even admitted into the royal society up in london but this is how he did it sir and as youe a friend of the family like and want to know all about it no doubt i don mind tellin you on the strict confidential in the manner of speakin here the landlord drew his chair closer and sipped the last drop in his glass of sherry with a mysterious air of very private and important disclosures ernest listened to his roundabout story with painful attention ell sir the landlord went on after a short and pensive pause ld mr oswald business ain never been a prosperous one hough he was such a clover hand at figgers he never made it remunerative a bare livin for the family i don mind sayin and he always spent more he ought to done on mr harry and on the young lady too sir savin your presence so when mr harry was goin to oxford to college he come to me and he says to me mr legge says he it a very expensive thing sending my boy to the university says he and i going to borrow money to send him with don you go aoin that mr oswald says i your business don justify you in doin it sir says i for you see i knowed all the ins and outs of that there business and i knowed he hadn never made more enough just to keep things goin decent like as you may say without any money saved or put by against a emergence yes i will mr legge says he i can trust confidentially in my son abilities says he and i feel confidential hel be in a position to repay me before long so he borrowed the money on an insurance of mr harry life mr harry he always acted very honourable sir he was a perfect gentleman in every way as you know sir and he began repayin his father the loan as fast as he was able and i daresay doin a great deal for the family and especially for the young lady sir out of his own pocket besides but he still owed his father a couple of hundred pound an more when this causality happened while the business i know had been aoin to rack and ruin for the last three year toay i seen the agent of the insurance and he says to me legge says he most private like this is a bad job about young oswald i afeard worse they know for why sir says i well legge says he theyl never get a penny of that there insurance and the old gentlemanl have to pay up the defissit on his own account says he how that mr micklethwaite says i because says he there a clause in the policy agin exceptional risks in which is included naval and military services furrin residences topical voyages and mountainlimbin says he and you mark my words says he theyl never get a penny of it in which case sir it my opinion that old mr oswaldl be clean broke for he can never make up the defissit out of his own business can he now ernest listened with sad forebodings to the redaced landlord pitiful story and feared in his heart that it was a bad lookut for the poor oswalds he didn sleep much that evening and next day he went round early to see edie the telegram he found would be a useless precaution for the gossip of calcombe pomeroy had recognised him at once and news had reached the oswalds almost as soon as he arrived that young mr le breton was stopping that evening at the red lion edie opened the door for him herself pale of face and with eyes reddened by tears yet looking beautiful even so in her simple black morning dress her mourning of course hadn yet come home nd her deep white linen collar t very good of you to have come so soon mr le breton she said taking his hand quietly e respected her sorrow too deeply to think of kissing her e will be back with us toorrow your brother is bringing him back to us to lay him in our little churchyard and we are all so very very grateful to him for it ernest was more than half surprised to hear it it was an unusual act of kindly thoughtfulness on the part of herbert next day the body came home as edie had said and ernest helped to lay it reverently to rest in calcombe churchyard poor old mr oswald standing bowed and brokenearted by the open grave side looked as though he could never outlive that solemn burial of all his hopes and aspirations in a single narrow coffin yet it was wonderful to ernest to see how much comfort he took even in this terrible grief from the leader which appeared in the imes that morning on the subject of the pontresina accident it contained only a few of the stock newspaper platitudes of regret at the loss of a distinguished and rising young light of science he ordinary glib commonplaces of obituary notices which a practised journalist knows so well how to adapt almost mechanically to the passing event of the moment but they seemed to afford the shattered old country grocer an amount of consolation and solemn relief that no mere spoken condolences could ever possibly have carried with them what a wonderful lot they thought of our boy up in london mr le breton he said looking up from the paper tearfully and wiping his big gold spectacles dim with moisture what the times says about him one of the ablest among our young academical mathematicians a man who if his life had been spared to us might probably have attained the highest distinction in his own department of pure science that our harry mr le breton that what the times says about our dear dead harry i wish he could have lived to read it himself edie a scholar of singularly profound attainments whose abilities had recently secured him a place upon the historic roll of the royal society and whom even the french academy of sciences had held worthy out of all the competitors of the civilised world to be adjudged the highest mathematical honours of the present season my poor boy my poor dear lost boy i wish you could have lived to hear it we must keep the paper edie we must keep all the papers theyl show us at least what people who are real judges of these things thought about our dear loved lost harry ernest dared hardly glance towards poor edie with the tears trickling slowly down her face but he felt thankful that the brokenearted old father could derive so much incomprehensible consolation from those cold and stereotyped conventional phrases truly a wonderful power there is in mere printer ink properly daubed on plain absorbent white paper and truly the human heart full to bursting and just ready to break will allow itself to be cheated and cajoled in marvellous fashions by extraordinary cordials and inexplicable little social palliatives the concentrated hopes of that old man life were blasted and blighted for ever and he found a temporary relief from that stunning shock in the artificial and insincere condolences of a stock leaderriter on a daily paper walking back by himself in such sad meditations to the red lion and sitting there by the open window ernest overheard a tremulous chattering voice mumbling out a few incoherent words at the rector doorway opposite h yes chirped out the voice in a tone of cheerful resignation t very sad indeed very sad and shocking and i naturally very sorry for it of course i always knew how it would be i warned them of it but theye a pigeaded heedless unmannerly family and they wouldn be guided by me i said to him now oswald this is all very wrong and foolish of you you go and put your son to oxford when he ought to be stopping at home minding the shop and learning your business you borrow money foolishly to send him there with hel go to oxford hel fall in with a lot of wealthy young gentlemen eople above his own natural station el take up expensive extravagant ways and in the end hel completely ruin himself he won pay you back a penny you may depend upon it hese boys never do when you make fine gentlemen of them they think only of their cigars and their horses and their dogarts and so forth and neglect their poor old fathers and mothers that brought them up and scraped and saved to make fine gentlemen of them you just take my advice oswald and don send him to college but oswald was always a presumptuous higheaded independent sort of man and instead of listening to me what does he do but go and send this sharp boy of his up to oxford well now the boy gone to switzerland with one of the young le bretons rother of the poor young man theye inveigled into what they call an engagement with miss edith or miss jemima or whatever the girl name is ery wellonnected people the le bretons and personal friends of the archdeacon nd there he thrown himself over a precipice or something of the sort no doubt to avoid his moneyatters and debts and difficulties at any rate micklethwaite tells me the poor old fatherl have to pay up a couple of hundred pound to the insurance company and how on earth he ever to do it i don know for to my certain knowledge the rent of the shop is in arrears halfear already but it no business of mine thank goodness nd i only hope that exposure will serve to open that poor young le breton eyes and to warn him against having anything further to say to miss jemima a designing young minx if ever there was one poor young le breton come down here for the funeral i hear which i must say was very friendly and proper and honourable of him but now it over i hope hel go back again and see miss jemima in her true colours ernest turned back into the stuffy little coffeeoom with his face on fire and his ears tingling with mingled shame and indignation hatever happens he thought to himself can permit edie to be subjected any longer to such insolence as this poor dear guileless sorrowing little maiden one would have thought her childish innocence and her terrible loss would have softened the heart even of such a cantankerous virulent old harridan as that till a few weeks were over at least she spoke of the archdeacon it must be old miss luttrell whoever it is though edie shan much longer be left where she can possibly come in contact with such a loathsome mass of incredible and unprovoked malice that edie should lose her dearlyoved brother is terrible enough but that she should be exposed afterwards to be triumphed over in her most sacred grief by that bad old woman querulous i told you so is simply intolerable and he paced up and down the room with a boiling heart unable to keep down his righteous anger chapter flat rebellion for the next fortnight ernest remained at the red lion though painfully conscious that he was sadly wasting his little reserve of funds from his late tutorship in order to find out exactly what the oswalds position would be after the loss of poor harry towards the end of that time he took edie pale and pretty in her simple new mourning out once more into the bourne close for half an hour quiet conversation very delicate and sweet and refined that tiny girlish face and figure looked in the plain unostentatious black and white of her great sorrow and ernest felt as he walked along by her side that she seemed to lean upon him naturally now the loss of her main support and chief advisor in life seemed to draw her closer and closer every day to her one remaining prop and future husband die he said to her as they rested once more beside the old wooden bridge across the little river think it time now we should begin to talk definitely over our common plans for the future i know you naturally rather wait a little longer before discussing them i wish for both our sakes we could have deferred it but time presses and i afraid from what i hear in the village that things won go on henceforth exactly as they used to do with your dear father and mother edie coloured slightly as she answered hen youe heard of all that already ernest he was learning to call him rnest now quite naturally he calcombe tattle has got round to you so soon i glad of it though for it saves me the pain of having to tell you yes it quite true and i afraid it will be a terrible dreadful struggle for poor darling father and mother and the tears came up afresh as she spoke into her big black eyes familiar with them of late to make her even try to brush them away hastily from ernest sight with her little handkerchief sorry to know it true ernest said taking her hand gently ery very sorry we must do what we can to lighten the trouble for them es edie replied looking at him through her tears mean to try at any rate i won be a burden to them myself any longer ie written already up to an agency in london to see whether they can manage to get me a place as a nurseryoverness ou a governess edie ernest exclaimed hastily with a gesture of deprecation ou a governess why my own precious darling you would never do for it h yes indeed edie answered quickly really think i could ernest of course i don know very much ot judged by a standard like yours or our dear harry harry used to say all a woman could ever know was to find out how ignorant she was dear fellow he was so very learned himself he couldn understand the complacency of little perky halfducated schoolmistresses but still i know quite as much i think in my little way as a great many girls who get good places in london as governesses i can speak french fairly well you know and read german decently and then dear harry took such a lot of pains to make me get up books that he thought were good for me istory and so forth nd even to teach me a little a very little latin of course i know i dreadfully ignorant but not more so i really believe than a great many girls whom people consider quite wellducated enough to teach their daughters after all the daughters themselves are only women too you see ernest and don expect more than a smattering of booknowledge and a few showy fashionable accomplishments y dear edie ernest answered smiling at her gently in spite of her tearful earnestness ou quite misunderstand me it wasn that i was thinking of at all there are very few governesses and very few women anywhere who have half the knowledge and accomplishments and literary taste and artistic culture that you have very few who have had the advantage of associating daily with such a man as poor harry and if you really wanted to get a place of the sort the mere fact that youe harry sister and that he interested himself in superintending your education ought by itself to ensure your getting a very good one but what i meant was rather this couldn endure to think that you should be put to all the petty slights and small humiliations that a governess has always to endure in rich families you don know what it is edie you can imagine the endless devices for making her feel her dependence and her artificial inferiority that these great people have devised in their cleverness and their christian condescension you don know what it is edie and i pray heaven you may never know but i do for ie seen it nd darling i can let you expose yourself to it to say the truth at that moment there rose very vividly before ernest eyes the picture of poor shy miss merivale the governess at dunbude to little lady sybil lynmouth younger sister miss merivale was a rector daughter n orphan and a very nice girl in her way and ernest had often thought to himself while he lived at the exmoors ith just the slightest turn of fortune wheel that might be my own edie now for himself he had never felt any sense of social inferiority at all at dunbude he was an oxford man and by the ordinary courtesy of english society he was always treated accordingly in every way as an equal but there were galling distinctions made in miss merivale case which he could not think of even at the time without a blush of ingenuous shame and which he did not like now even to mention to pretty shrinking eager little edie one thing alone was enough to make his cheeks burn whenever he thought of it little thing and yet how unendurable miss merivale lunched with the family and with her pupil in the middle of the day but she did not dine with them in the evening she had tea by herself instead in lady sybil little schooloom many a time when ernest had been out walking with her on the terrace just before dinner and the dressingong sounded he had felt almost too ashamed to go in at the summons and leave the poor little governess out there alone with her social disabilities the gong seemed to raise such a hideous artificial barrier between himself and that delicatelyred sensitive cultivated english lady that edie should be subjected to such a life of affronts as that was simply unendurable true there are social distinctions of the sort which even ernest le breton communist as he was could not practically get over but then they were distinctions familiarised to the sufferers from childhood upward and so perhaps a little less insupportable but that harry oswald sister hat edie his own precious delicate little edie a dainty english wildlower of the tenderest should be transplanted from her own appreciative home to such a chilly and ungenial soil as that he very idea of it was horribly unspeakable ut ernest edie answered breaking in upon his bitter meditation assure you i wouldn mind it a bit i know t very dreadful but then nd here she blushed one of her pretty apologetic little blushes ou know i used to it people in business always are they expect to be treated just like servant ow that i know youl say is itself a piece of hubris the expression of a horrid class prejudice and so it is no doubt but they do for all that as dear harry used to say even the polypes in aristocratic useless sponges at the seaottom won have anything to say to the sponges of commerce i sure nobody i could meet in a governess place could possibly be worse in that respect than poor old miss catherine luttrell hat may be true edie darling ernest answered not caring to let her know that he had overheard a specimen of the calcombe squirearchy ut in any case i don want you to be troubled now either with old miss luttrell or any other bitter old busybodies i want to speak seriously to you about a very different project just look at this advertisement he took a scrap of paper from his pocket and handed it to edie it ran thus anted at pilbury regis grammar school dorset a third classical master must be a graduate of oxford or cambridge university prizeman preferred if unmarried to take house duty commence september th salary a year apply as above to the rev j greatrex head master edie read it through slowly ell ernest she said looking up from it into his face o you think of taking this mastership f i can get it ernest answered ou see i not a university prizeman and that may be a difficulty in the way but otherwise i not unlikely to suit the requirements herbert knows something of the school e been down there to examine and mrs greatrex had a sort of distant bowing acquaintance with my mother so i hope their influence might help me into it ell ernest edie cried again feeling pretty certain in her own heart what was coming next and reddening accordingly ell edie in that case would you care to marry at once and try the experiment of beginning life with me upon two hundred a year i know it very little darling for our wants and necessities brought up as you and i have been but herr max says you know it as much as any one family ought ever to spend upon its own gratifications and at any rate i dare say you and i could manage to be very happy upon it at least for the present in any case it would be better than being a governess will you risk it edie o me ernest edie answered with her unaffected simplicity t really seems quite a magnificent income i don suppose any of our friends or neighbours in calcombe spend nearly as much as two hundred a year upon their own families h yes they do darling but that isn the only thing two hundred a year is a very different matter in quiet oldorld little calcombe and in a fashionable modern wateringlace like pilbury regis we shall have to live in lodgings edie and live very quietly indeed but even so i think it will be better than for you to go out and endure the humiliation of becoming a governess then i may understand that if i can get this mastership youl consent to be married edie before the end of september h ernest that dreadfully soon es it is darling but you must have a very quiet wedding and i can bear to leave you here now any longer without harry to cheer and protect you shall we look upon it as settled edie blushed and looked down as she answered almost inaudibly s you think best dear ernest so that very evening ernest sent off an application to pilbury regis together with such testimonials as he had by him mentioning at the same time his intention to marry and his recent engagement at lord exmoor hope they won make a point about the university prize edie he said timidly ut i rather think they don mean to insist upon it i afraid it may be put in to some extent mainly as a bait to attract parents advertisements are often so very dishonest at any rate we can only try and if i get it i shall be able to call you my little wife in september so soon after poor harry death he hardly liked to say much about how happy that consciousness would make him but he sent off the letter with a beating heart and waited anxiously for the head master answer aria said dr greatrex to his wife next morning turning over the pile of letters at the breakfast table ho do you think has applied for the third mastership very lucky really isn it onsidering that there are some thirty millions of people in england i believe dr greatrex said his wife with dignity hat some seventy of those have answered your advertisement and that you haven yet given me an opportunity even of guessing which it is of them all i sure i can say so far whether it lucky or otherwise oue pleased to be satirical my dear the doctor answered blandly he was in too good a humour to pursue the opening further ut no matter well il tell you then it young le breton ot lady le breton son cried mrs greatrex forgetting her dignity in her surprise ell that certainly is very lucky now if we could only get her to come down and stay with us for a week sometimes after he been here a little while what a splendid advertisement it would be for the place to be sure joseph apital the head master said eyeing the letter complacently as he sipped his coffee perfect jewel of a master i should say from every possible point of view just the sort of person to attract parents and pupils allow me to introduce you to our third master mr le breton i hope lady le breton was quite well when you heard from her last le breton and all that sort of thing depend upon it maria there nothing in the world that makes a middlelass parent nd our parents are unfortunately all middlelass rick up his ears like the faintest suspicion or echo of a title very good school he goes back and says to his wife immediately wel send tommy there they have a master who an honourable or something of the sort sure to give the boys a thoroughly high gentlemanly tone it snobbery i admit sheer snobbery but between ourselves maria most people are snobs and we have to live professionally by accommodating ourselves to their foolish prejudices t the same time doctor said his wife severely don think we ought to allow it too freely at least with the door open oue quite right my dear the head master answered submissively rising at the same time to shut the door ut what makes this particular application all the better is that young le breton would come here straight from the earl of exmoor where he has been acting as tutor to the son and heir viscount lynmouth that really admirable now isn it just consider the advantages of the situation a doubtful parent comes to inspect the arrangements sniffs at the dormitories takes the gauge of the studies snorts over the playground condescends to approve of the fives courts then after doing the usual christian principles business and working in the high moral tone a little we invite him to lunch and young le breton to meet him you remark casually in the most unconscious and natural fashion admit my dear that you do these little things much better than i do oh talking of cricket mr le breton your old pupil lord lynmouth made a splendid score the other day at the eton and harrow fixes the wavering parent like a shot third master something or other in the peerage and has been tutor to a son of lord exmoor place to send your boys to if you want to make perfect gentlemen of them i think we better close at once with this young man offer maria he got a very decent degree too a first in mods and greats really very decent ut will he take a houseastership do you think doctor asked the careful lady o he won he married or soon going to be we must let him off the house duty arried said mrs greatrex turning it over cautiously ho he going to marry i wonder i hope somebody presentable hy of course dr greatrex answered as who should feel shocked at the bare suggestion that a young man of ernest le breton antecedents could conceivably marry otherwise is wife or rather his wife that is to be is a sister he tells me of that poor mr oswald he famous mathematician you know of oriel ho got killed you remember by falling off the matterhorn or somewhere just the other day you must have seen about it in the times remember mrs greatrex answered in placid contentment nd i should say you can do better than take him immediately it be an excellent thing for the school certainly as the third mastership worth only two hundred a year of course he can intend to marry upon that so he must have means of his own which is always a good thing to encourage in an underaster or if his wife has money that comes in the end to the same thing theyl take a house of their own no doubt and shel probably entertain ery quietly i daresay still a small dinner now and then gives a very excellent tone to the school in its own way social considerations as i always say joseph are allmportant in school management and i think we may take it for granted that mr le breton would be socially a real acquisition so it was shortly settled that dr greatrex should write back accepting ernest le breton as third master and mrs greatrex began immediately dropping stray allusions to ady le breton our new master mother you know among her various acquaintance especially those with rising young families the doctor and she thought a good deal of this catch they were making in the person of ernest le breton poor souls they little knew what sort of social qualities they were letting themselves in for a firebrand or a bombshell would really have been a less remarkable guest to drop down straight into the prim and proper orthodox society of pilbury regis when ernest received the letter in which dr greatrex informed him that he might have the third mastership he hardly knew how to contain his joy he kissed edie a dozen times over in his excitement and sat up late making plans with her which would have been delightful but for poor edie lasting sorrow in a short time it was all duly arranged and ernest began to think that he must go back to london for a day or two to let lady le breton hear of his change of plans and got everything in order for their quiet wedding he grudged the journey sadly for he was beginning to understand now that he must take care of the pence for edie sake as well as for humanity is abstraction was individualising itself in concrete form ut he felt so much at least was demanded of him by filial duty and besides he had one or two little matters to settle at epsilon terrace which could not so well be managed in his absence even by his trusty deputy ronald so he ran up to town once more in a hurry and dropped in as if nothing had happened at his mother house it was no unusual matter for him to pass a fortnight at wilton place without finding time to call round at epsilon terrace to see ronald and his mother had not heard at all as yet of his recent change of engagement lady le breton listened with severe displeasure to ernest account of his quarrel with lord exmoor it was quite unnecessary and wrong she said to prevent lynmouth from his innocent boyish amusements pigeonhooting was practised by the very best people and she was quite sure therefore there could be no harm of any sort in it she believed the sport was countenanced not only by bishops but even by princes pigeons she supposed had been specially created by providence for our use and enjoyment heir final cause being apparently the manufacture of pigeonie ronald suggested parenthetically but we couldn use them without killing them unfortunately and shooting was probably as painless a form of killing as any other peter or somebody she distinctly remembered had been specially commanded to arise kill and eat to object to pigeonhooting indeed in lady le breton opinion was clearly flying in the face of providence of ronald muttered reference to five sparrows being sold for two farthings and yet not one of them being forgotten she would not condescend to take any notice however thank goodness the fault was none of hers she could wash her hands entirely of all responsibility in the matter she had done her best to secure ernest a good place in a thoroughly nice family and if he chose to throw it up at a moment notice for one of his own absurd communistical fads it was happily none of her business she was glad at any rate that he got another berth with a conscientious earnest christian man like dr greatrex nd indeed ernest she said returning once more to the pigeonhooting question ven your poor dear papa who was full of such absurd religious fancies didn think that sport was unchristian i certain for i remember once when we were quartered at moozuffernugger in the northest provinces he went out into a nullah near our compound one day and with his own hand shot a manating tiger which had carried off three little native children from the thanah so that shows that he couldn really object to sport and i hope you don mean to cast disrespect upon the memory of your own poor father all of which profound moral and religious observations ernest as in duty bound received with the most respectful and acquiescent silence and now he had to approach the more difficult task of breaking to his mother his approaching marriage with edie oswald he began the subject as delicately as he could dwelling strongly upon poor harry oswald excellent position as an oxford tutor and upon herbert visit with him to switzerland e knew his mother too well to suppose that the real merits of the oswald family would impress her in any way as compared with their accidental social status and then he went on to speak as gently as possible about his engagement with little edie at this point to his exceeding discomfiture lady le breton adopted the unusual tactics of bursting suddenly into a flood of tears h ernest she sobbed out inarticulately through her scented cambric handkerchief or heaven sake don tell me that youe gone and engaged yourself to that designing girl oh my poor poor misguided boy is there really no way to save you o way to save me exclaimed ernest astonished and disconcerted by this unexpected outburst es yes lady le breton went on almost passionately an you manage somehow to get yourself out of it i hope you haven utterly compromised yourself couldn dear herbert go down to whatisame pomeroy and induce the father grocer if i remember right nduce him somehow or other to compromise the matter ompromise cried ernest uncertain whether to laugh or be angry es compromise it lady le breton answered endeavouring to calm herself f course that machiavellian girl has tried to drag you into it and the family have aided and abetted her and youe been weak and foolish hough not i trust wicked nd allowed them to get their net closed almost imperceptibly around you but it isn too late to withdraw even now my poor dear deluded ernest it isn too late to withdraw even now think of the disgrace and shame to the family think of your dear brothers and their blighted prospects don allow this designing girl to draw you helplessly into such an illssorted marriage reflect upon your own future happiness consider what it will be to drag on years of your life with a woman no longer perhaps externally attractive whom you could never possibly respect or love for her own internal qualities don go and wreck your own life and your brothers lives for any mistaken and quixotic notions of false honour you mayn like to throw her over after youe once been inveigled into saying yes and the feeling though foolish does your heart credi but reflect my dear boy such a promise so obtained can hardly be considered binding upon your conscience ie no doubt dear herbert who a capital man of business would get them readily enough to agree to a compromise or a compensation y dear mother aid ernest white with indignation but speaking very quietly as soon as he could edge in a word ou quite misunderstand the whole question edie oswald is a lady by nature with all a lady best feelings hate the word because of its false implications but i can use any other that will convey to you my meaning nd i love and admire and respect and worship her with all my heart and with all my soul she hasn inveigled me or set her cap at me as you call it in any way she the sweetest timidest most shrinking little thing that ever existed on the contrary it is i who have humbly asked her to accept me because i know no other woman to whom i could give my whole heart so unreservedly to tell you the truth mother with my ideas and opinions i could hardly be happy with any girl of the class that you would call distinctively ladies their class prejudices and their social predilections would jar and grate upon me at every turn but edie oswald a girl whom i could worship and love without any reserve hom i can reverence for her beautiful character her goodness and her delicacy of feeling she has honoured me by accepting me and i going to marry her at the end of this month and i want if possible to get your consent to the marriage before i do so she a wife of whom i shall be proud in every way i wish i could think she would have equal cause to be proud of her husband lady le breton threw herself once more into a paroxysm of tears h ernest she cried o spare me do spare me this is too wicked too unfeeling too cruel of you altogether i knew already you were very selfish and heartless and headstrong but i didn know you were quite so unmanageable and so unkind as this i appeal to your better nature or you have a better nature sure you have a better nature youe my son and you can be utterly devoid of good impulses i appeal confidently to your better nature to throw off this unhappy designing wicked girl before it is too late she has made you forget your duty to your mother but not i hope irrevocably oh my poor dear wandering boy won you listen to the voice of reason won you return once more like the prodigal son to your neglected mother and your forgotten duty y dear mother ernest said hardly knowing how to answer ou will persist in completely misunderstanding me i love edie oswald with all my heart i have promised to marry her because she has done me the great and undeserved honour of accepting me as her future husband and even if i wanted to break off the engagement which it would break my own heart to i certainly couldn break it off now without the most disgraceful and dishonourable wickedness that is quite fixed and certain and i can go back upon it in any way hen you insist you unnatural boy said lady le breton wiping her eyes and assuming the air of an injured parent ou insist against my express wish in marrying this girl osborne or whatever you call her
