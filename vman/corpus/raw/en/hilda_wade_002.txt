gazed at her uncertain and what will you do i asked expose him she opened both her palms with a blank gesture of helplessness it is useless she answered nobody would believe me consider the situation you know the needle i gave you was the one sebastian meant to use he one he dropped and i caught ecause you are a friend of mine and because you have learned to trust me but who else would credit it i have only my word against his n unknown nurse against the great professor everybody would say i was malicious or hysterical hysteria is always an easy stone to fling at an injured woman who asks for justice they would declare i had trumped up the case to forestall my dismissal they would set it down to spite we can do nothing against him remember on his part the utter absence of overt motive and you mean to stop on here in close attendance on a man who has attempted your life i cried really alarmed for her safety i am not sure about that she answered i must take time to think my presence at nathaniel was necessary to my plan the plan fails for the present i have now to look round and reconsider my position but you are not safe here now i urged growing warm if sebastian really wishes to get rid of you and is as unscrupulous as you suppose with his gigantic brain he can soon compass his end what he plans he executes you ought not to remain within the professor reach one hour longer i have thought of that too she replied with an almost unearthly calm but there are difficulties either way at any rate i am glad he did not succeed this time for to have killed me now would have frustrated my plan he clasped her hands my plan is ten thousand times dearer than life to me dear lady i cried drawing a deep breath i implore you in this strait listen to what i urge why fight your battle alone why refuse assistance i have admired you so long am so eager to help you if only you will allow me to call you her eyes brightened and softened her whole bosom heaved i felt in a flash she was not wholly indifferent to me strange tremors in the air seemed to play about us but she waved me aside once more don press me she said in a very low voice let me go my own way it is hard enough already this task i have undertaken without your making it harder dear friend dear friend you don quite understand there are two men at nathaniel whom i desire to escape ecause they both alike stand in the way of my purpose she took my hands in hers each in a different way she murmured once more but each i must avoid one is sebastian the other she let my hand drop again and broke off suddenly dear hubert she cried with a catch i cannot help it forgive me it was the first time she had ever called me by my christian name the mere sound of the word made me unspeakably happy yet she waved me away must i go i asked quivering yes yes you must go i cannot stand it i must think this thing out undisturbed it is a very great crisis that afternoon and evening by some unhappy chance i was fully engaged in work at the hospital late at night a letter arrived for me i glanced at it in dismay it bore the basingstoke postmark but to my alarm and surprise it was in hilda hand what could this change portend i opened it all tremulous dear hubert i gave a sigh of relief it was no longer dear dr cumberledge now but hubert that was something gained at any rate i read on with a beating heart what had hilda to say to me dear hubert y the time this reaches you i shall be far away irrevocably far from london with deep regret with fierce searchings of spirit i have come to the conclusion that for the purpose i have in view it would be better for me at once to leave nathaniel where i go or what i mean to do i do not wish to tell you of your charity i pray refrain from asking me i am aware that your kindness and generosity deserve better recognition but like sebastian himself i am the slave of my purpose i have lived for it all these years and it is still very dear to me to tell you my plans would interfere with that end do not therefore suppose i am insensible to your goodness dear hubert spare me dare not say more lest i say too much i dare not trust myself but one thing i must say i am flying from you quite as much as from sebastian flying from my own heart quite as much as from my enemy some day perhaps if i accomplish my object i may tell you all meanwhile i can only beg of you of your kindness to trust me we shall not meet again i fear for years but i shall never forget you ou the kind counsellor who have half turned me aside from my life purpose one word more and i should falter n very great haste and amid much disturbance yours ever affectionately and gratefully hilda it was a hurried scrawl in pencil as if written in a train i felt utterly dejected was hilda then leaving england rousing myself after some minutes i went straight to sebastian rooms and told him in brief terms that nurse wade had disappeared at a moment notice and had sent a note to tell me so he looked up from his work and scanned me hard as was his wont that is well he said at last his eyes glowing deep she was getting too great a hold on you that young woman she retains that hold upon me sir i answered curtly you are making a grave mistake in life my dear cumberledge he went on in his old genial tone which i had almost forgotten before you go further and entangle yourself more deeply i think it is only right that i should undeceive you as to this girl true position she is passing under a false name and she comes of a tainted stock nurse wade as she chooses to call herself is a daughter of the notorious murderer yorkeannerman my mind leapt back to the incident of the broken basin yorkeannerman name had profoundly moved her then i thought of hilda face murderers i said to myself do not beget such daughters as that not even accidental murderers like my poor friend le geyt i saw at once the prima facie evidence was strongly against her but i had faith in her still i drew myself up firmly and stared him back full in the face i do not believe it i answered shortly you do not believe it i tell you it is so the girl herself as good as acknowledged it to me i spoke slowly and distinctly dr sebastian i said confronting him let us be quite clear with one another i have found you out i know how you tried to poison that lady to poison her with bacilli which i detected i cannot trust your word i cannot trust your inferences either she is not yorkeannerman daughter at all or else yorkeannerman was not a murderer i watched his face closely conviction leaped upon me and someone else was i went on i might put a name to him with a stern white face he rose and opened the door he pointed to it slowly this hospital is not big enough for you and me abreast he said with cold politeness one or other of us must go which i leave to your good sense to determine even at that moment of detection and disgrace in one man eyes at least sebastian retained his full measure of dignity i saw she was probably right for klaas was out of cartridges and was waiting for my new stock to arrive from england if that were correct they must get near enough to attack us with assegais they are more dangerous so i remembered what an old boer had said to me at buluwayo the zulu with his assegai is an enemy to be feared with a gun he is a bungler we pounded on up the hill it was deadly work with those brutes at our heels the child on hilda arm was visibly wearying her it kept on whining hilda i cried that baby will lose your life you cannot go on carrying it she turned to me with a flash of her eyes what you are a man she broke out and you ask a woman to save her life by abandoning a baby hubert you shame me i felt she was right if she had been capable of giving it up she would not have been hilda there was but one other way left then you must take the pony i called out and let me have the bicycle you couldn ride it she called back it is a woman machine remember yes i could i replied without slowing it is not much too short and i can bend my knees a bit quick quick no words do as i tell you she hesitated a second the child weight distressed her we should lose time in changing she answered at last doubtful but still pedalling though my hand was on the rein ready to pull up the pony not if we manage it right obey orders the moment i say alt i shall slacken my mare pace when you see me leave the saddle jump off instantly you and mount her i will catch the machine before it falls are you ready halt then she obeyed the word without one second delay i slipped off held the bridle caught the bicycle and led it instantaneously then i ran beside the pony ridle in one hand machine in the other ill hilda had sprung with a light bound into the stirrup at that a little leap and i mounted the bicycle it was all done nimbly in less time than the telling takes for we are both of us naturally quick in our movements hilda rode like a man astride er short bicycling skirt unobtrusively divided in front and at the back made this easily possible looking behind me with a hasty glance i could see that the savages taken aback had reined in to deliberate at our unwonted evolution i feel sure that the novelty of the iron horse with a woman riding it played not a little on their superstitious fears they suspected no doubt this was some ingenious new engine of war devised against them by the unaccountable white man it might go off unexpectedly in their faces at any moment most of them i observed as they halted carried on their backs black oxide shields interlaced with white thongs they were armed with two or three assegais apiece and a knobkerry instead of losing time by the change as it turned out we had actually gained it hilda was able to put on my sorrel to her full pace which i had not dared to do for fear of outrunning my companion the wise little beast for her part seemed to rise to the occasion and to understand that we were pursued for she stepped out bravely on the other hand in spite of the low seat and the short crank of a woman machine i could pedal up the slope with more force than hilda for i am a practised hilllimber so that in both ways we gained besides having momentarily disconcerted and checked the enemy their ponies were tired and they rode them full tilt with savage recklessness making them canter upill and so needlessly fatiguing them the matabele indeed are unused to horses and manage them but ill it is as foot soldiers creeping stealthily through bush or long grass that they are really formidable only one of their mounts was tolerably fresh the one which had once already almost overtaken us as we neared the top of the slope hilda glancing behind her exclaimed with a sudden thrill he is spurting again hubert i drew my revolver and held it in my right hand using my left for steering i did not look back time was far too precious i set my teeth hard tell me when he draws near enough for a shot i said quietly hilda only nodded being mounted on the mare she could see behind her more steadily now than i could from the machine and her eye was trustworthy as for the baby rocked by the heave and fall of the pony withers it had fallen asleep placidly in the very midst of this terror after a second i asked once more with bated breath is he gaining she looked back yes gaining a pause and now still gaining he is poising an assegai ten seconds more passed in breathless suspense the thud of their horses hoofs alone told me their nearness my finger was on the trigger i awaited the word fire she said at last in a calm unflinching voice he is well within distance i turned half round and levelled as true as i could at the advancing black man he rode nearly naked showing all his teeth and brandishing his assegai the long white feathers stuck upright in his hair gave him a wild and terrifying barbaric aspect it was difficult to preserve one balance keep the way on and shoot all at the same time but spurred by necessity i somehow did it i fired three shots in quick succession my first bullet missed my second knocked the man over my third grazed the horse with a ringing shriek the matabele fell in the road a black writhing mass his horse terrified dashed back with maddened snorts into the midst of the others its plunging disconcerted the whole party for a minute we did not wait to see the rest taking advantage of this momentary diversion in our favour we rode on at full speed to the top of the slope never knew before how hard i could pedal nd began to descend at a dash into the opposite hollow the sun had set by this time there is no twilight in those latitudes it grew dark at once we could see now in the plain all round where black clouds of smoke had rolled before one lurid red glare of burning houses mixed with a sullen haze of tawny light from the columns of prairie fire kindled by the insurgents we made our way still onward across the open plain without one word towards salisbury the mare was giving out she strode with a will but her flanks were white with froth her breath came short foam flew from her nostrils as we mounted the next ridge still distancing our pursuers i saw suddenly on its crest defined against the livid red sky like a silhouette two more mounted black men it all up hilda i cried losing heart at last they are on both sides of us now the mare is spent we are surrounded she drew rein and gazed at them for a moment suspense spoke in all her attitude then she burst into a sudden deep sigh of relief no no she cried these are friendlies how do you know i gasped but i believed her they are looking out this way with hands shading their eyes against the red glare they are looking away from salisbury in the direction of the attack they are expecting the enemy they must be friendlies see see they have caught sight of us as she spoke one of the men lifted his rifle and half pointed it don shoot don shoot i shrieked aloud we are english english the men let their rifles drop and rode down towards us who are you i cried they saluted us military fashion matabele police sah the leader answered recognising me you are flying from klaas yes i answered they have murdered klaas with his wife and child some of them are now following us the spokesman was a wellducated cape town negro all right sah he answered i have forty men here right behind de kopje let dem come we can give a good account of dem ride on straight wit de lady to salisbury the salisbury people know of this rising then i asked yes sah dem know since five olock kaffir boys from klaas brought in de news and a white man escaped from rozenboom confirm it we have pickets all round you is safe now you can ride on into salisbury witout fear of de matabele i rode on relieved mechanically my feet worked to and fro on the pedals it was a gentle downradient now towards the town i had no further need for special exertion suddenly hilda voice came wafted to me as through a mist what are you doing hubert youl be off in a minute i started and recovered my balance with difficulty then i was aware at once that one second before i had all but dropped asleep dog tired on the bicycle worn out with my long day and with the nervous strain i began to doze off with my feet still moving round and round automatically the moment the anxiety of the chase was relieved and an easy downrade gave me a little respite i kept myself awake even then with difficulty riding on through the lurid gloom we reached salisbury at last and found the town already crowded with refugees from the plateau however we succeeded in securing two rooms at a house in the long street and were soon sitting down to a mucheeded supper as we rested an hour or two later in the illurnished back room discussing this sudden turn of affairs with our host and some neighbours or of course all salisbury was eager for news from the scene of the massacres happened to raise my head and saw to my great surprise a haggard white face peering in at us through the window it peered round a corner stealthily it was an ascetic face very sharp and clearut it had a stately profile the long and wiry grizzled moustache the deepet hawkike eyes the acute intense intellectual features all were very familiar so was the outer setting of long white hair straight and silvery as it fell and just curled in one waveike inward sweep where it turned and rested on the stooping shoulders but the expression on the face was even stranger than the sudden apparition it was an expression of keen and poignant disappointment s of a man whom fate has baulked of some welllanned end his due by right which mere chance has evaded they say there a white man at the bottom of all this trouble our host had been remarking one second earlier the niggers know too much and where did they get their rifles people at rozenboom believe some blackivered traitor has been stirring up the matabele for weeks and weeks an enemy of rhodes of course jealous of our advance a french agent perhaps but more likely one of these confounded transvaal dutchmen depend upon it it kruger doing as the words fell from his lips i saw the face i gave a quick little start then recovered my composure but hilda noted it she looked up at me hastily she was sitting with her back to the window and therefore of course could not see the face itself which indeed was withdrawn with a hurried movement yet with a certain strange dignity almost before i could feel sure of having seen it still she caught my startled expression and the gleam of surprise and recognition in my eye she laid one hand upon my arm you have seen him she asked quietly almost below her breath seen whom sebastian it was useless denying it to her yes i have seen him i answered in a confidential aside just now his moment t the back of the house in at the window upon us you are right s always she drew a deep breath he has played his game she said low to me in an awed undertone i felt sure it was he i expected him to play though what piece i knew not and when i saw those poor dead souls i was certain he had done it ndirectly done it the matabele are his pawns he wanted to aim a blow at me and this was the way he chose to aim it do you think he is capable of that i cried for in spite of all i had still a sort of lingering respect for sebastian it seems so reckless ike the worst of anarchists hen he strikes at one head to involve so many irrelevant lives in one common destruction hilda face was like a drowned man to sebastian she answered shuddering the end is all the means are unessential who wills the end wills the means that is the sum and substance of his philosophy of life from first to last he has always acted up to it did i not tell you once he was a snowlad volcano still i am loth to believe i cried she interrupted me calmly i knew it she said i expected it beneath that cold exterior the fires of his life burn fiercely still i told you we must wait for sebastian next move though i confess even from him i hardly dreamt of this one but from the moment when i opened the door on poor tant mettie body lying there in its red horror i felt it must be he and when you started just now i said to myself in a flash of intuition ebastian has come he has come to see how his devil work has prospered he sees it has gone wrong so now he will try to devise some other i thought of the malign expression on that cruel white face as it stared in at the window from the outer gloom and i felt convinced she was right she had read her man once more for it was the desperate contorted face of one appalled to discover that a great crime attempted and successfully carried out has failed by mere accident of its central intention chapter the episode of the european with the kaffir heart unfashionable as it is to say so i am a man of peace i belong to a profession whose province is to heal not to destroy still there are times which turn even the most peaceful of us perforce into fighters imes when those we love those we are bound to protect stand in danger of their lives and at moments like that no man can doubt what is his plain duty the matabele revolt was one such moment in a conflict of race we must back our own colour i do not know whether the natives were justified in rising or not most likely yes for we had stolen their country but when once they rose when the security of white women depended upon repelling them i felt i had no alternative for hilda sake for the sake of every woman and child in salisbury and in all rhodesia i was bound to bear my part in restoring order for the immediate future it is true we were safe enough in the little town but we did not know how far the revolt might have spread we could not tell what had happened at charter at buluwayo at the outlying stations the matabele perhaps had risen in force over the whole vast area which was once loengula country if so their first object would certainly be to cut us off from communication with the main body of english settlers at buluwayo i trust to you hilda i said on the day after the massacre at klaas to divine for us where these savages are next likely to attack us she cooed at the motherless baby raising one bent finger and then turned to me with a white smile then you ask too much of me she answered just think what a correct answer would imply first a knowledge of these savages character next a knowledge of their mode of fighting can you see that only a person who possessed my trick of intuition and who had also spent years in warfare among the matabele would be really able to answer your question and yet such questions have been answered before now by people far less intuitive than you i went on why ie read somewhere how when the war between napoleon the first and the prussians broke out in jomini predicted that the decisive battle of the campaign would be fought near jena and near jena it was fought are not you better than many jominis hilda tickled the baby cheek smile then baby smile she said pouncing one soft finger on a gathering dimple and who was your friend jomini the greatest military critic and tactician of his age i answered one of napoleon generals i fancy he wrote a book don you know book on war es grandes operations militaires or something of that sort well there you are then that just it your jomini or hominy or whatever you call him not only understood napoleon temperament but understood war and understood tactics it was all a question of the lie of the land and strategy and so forth if i had been asked i could never have answered a quarter as well as jomini piccolomini ould i baby jomini would have been worth a good many me there there a dear motherless darling why she crows just as if she hadn lost all her family but hilda we must be serious i count upon you to help us in this matter we are still in danger even now these matabele may attack and destroy us she laid the child on her lap and looked grave i know it hubert but i must leave it now to you men i am no tactician don take me for one of napoleon generals still i said we have not only the matabele to reckon with recollect there is sebastian as well and whether you know your matabele or not you at least know your sebastian she shuddered i know him yes i know him but this case is so difficult we have sebastian omplicated by a rabble of savages whose habits and manners i do not understand it is that that makes the difficulty but sebastian himself i urged take him first in isolation she paused for a full minute with her chin on her hand and her elbow on the table her brow gathered sebastian she repeated sebastian h there i might guess something well of course having once begun this attempt and being definitely committed as it were to a policy of killing us he will go through to the bitter end no matter how many other lives it may cost that is sebastian method you don think having once found out that i saw and recognised him he would consider the game lost and slink away to the coast again sebastian oh no that is the absolute antipodes of his type and temperament he will never give up because of a temporary check you think no never the man has a will of sheer steel t may break but it will not bend besides consider he is too deeply involved you have seen him you know and he knows you know you may bring this thing home to him then what is his plain policy why to egg on the natives whose confidence he has somehow gained into making a further attack and cutting off all salisbury if he had succeeded in getting you and me massacred at klaas as he hoped he would no doubt have slunk off to the coast at once leaving his black dupes to be shot down at leisure by rhodes soldiers i see but having failed in that then he is bound to go through with it and kill us if he can even if he has to kill all salisbury with us that i feel sure is sebastian plan whether he can get the matabele to back him up in it or not is a different matter but taking sebastian himself alone oh sebastian himself alone would naturally say ever mind buluwayo concentrate round salisbury and kill off all there first when that is done then you can move on at your ease and cut them to pieces in charter and buluwayo you see he would have no interest in the movement himself once he had fairly got rid of us here the matabele are only the pieces in his game it is me he wants not salisbury he would clear out of rhodesia as soon as he had carried his point but he would have to give some reasonable ground to the matabele for his first advice and it seems a reasonable ground to say on leave salisbury in your rear so as to put yourselves between two fires capture the outpost first that down march on undistracted to the principal stronghold who is no tactician i murmured half aloud she laughed that not tactics hubert that plain common sense nd knowledge of sebastian still it comes to nothing the question is not hat would sebastian wish it is ould sebastian persuade these angry black men to accept his guidance sebastian i cried sebastian could persuade the very devil i know the man fiery enthusiasm his contagious eloquence he thrilled me through myself with his electric personality so that it took me six years nd your aid o find him out at last his very abstractness tells why even in this war you may be sure he will be making notes all the time on the healing of wounds in tropical climates contrasting the african with the european constitution oh yes of course whatever he does he will never forget the interests of science he is true to his ladyove to whomever else he plays false that is his saving virtue and he will talk down the matabele i went on even if he doesn know their language but i suspect he does for you must remember he was three years in south africa as a young man on a scientific expedition collecting specimens he can ride like a trooper and he knows the country his masterful ways his austere face will cow the natives then again he has the air of a prophet and prophets always stir the negro i can imagine with what air he will bid them drive out the intrusive white men who have usurped their land and draw them flattering pictures of a new matabele empire about to arise under a new chief too strong for these goldrubbing diamondunting mobs from over sea to meddle with she reflected once more do you mean to say anything of our suspicions in salisbury hubert she asked at last it is useless i answered the salisbury folk believe there is a white man at the bottom of this trouble already they will try to catch him that all that is necessary if we said it was sebastian people would only laugh at us they must understand sebastian as you and i understand him before they would think such a move credible as a rule in life if you know anything which other people do not know better keep it to yourself you will only get laughed at as a fool for telling it i think so too that is why i never say what i suspect or infer from my knowledge of types xcept to a few who can understand and appreciate hubert if they all arm for the defence of the town you will stop here i suppose to tend the wounded her lips trembled as she spoke and she gazed at me with a strange wistfulness no dearest i answered at once taking her face in my hands i shall fight with the rest salisbury has more need toay of fighters than of healers i thought you would she answered slowly and i think you do right her face was set white she played nervously with the baby i would not urge you but i am glad you say so i want you to stop yet i could not love you so much if i did not see you ready to play the man at such a crisis i shall give in my name with the rest i answered hubert it is hard to spare you ard to send you to such danger but for one other thing i am glad you are going they must take sebastian alive they must not kill him they will shoot him redanded if they catch him i answered confidently a white man who sides with the blacks in an insurrection then you must see that they do not do it they must bring him in alive and try him legally for me nd therefore for you hat is of the first importance why so hilda hubert you want to marry me i nodded vehemently well you know i can only marry you on one condition hat i have succeeded first in clearing my father memory now the only man living who can clear it is sebastian if sebastian were to be shot it could never be cleared nd then law of medes and persians i could never marry you but how can you expect sebastian of all men to clear it hilda i cried he is ready to kill us both merely to prevent your attempting a revision is it likely you can force him to confess his crime still less induce him to admit it voluntarily she placed her hands over her eyes and pressed them hard with a strange prophetic air she often had about her when she gazed into the future i know my man she answered slowly without uncovering her eyes i know how i can do it f the chance ever comes to me but the chance must come first it is hard to find i lost it once at nathaniel i must not lose it again if sebastian is killed skulking here in rhodesia my life purpose will have failed i shall not have vindicated my father good name and then we can never marry so i understand hilda my orders are these i am to go out and fight for the women and children if possible that sebastian shall be made prisoner alive and on no account to let him be killed in the open i give you no orders hubert i tell you how it seems best to me but if sebastian is shot dead hen you understand it must be all over between us i never can marry you until or unless i have cleared my father sebastian shall not be shot dead i cried with my youthful impetuosity he shall be brought in alive though all salisbury as one man try its best to lynch him i went out to report myself as a volunteer for service within the next few hours the whole town had been put in a state of siege and all available men armed to oppose the insurgent matabele hasty preparations were made for defence the oxaggons of settlers were drawn up outside in little circles here and there so as to form laagers which acted practically as temporary forts for the protection of the outskirts in one of these i was posted with our company were two american scouts named colebrook and doolittle irregular fighters whose value in south african campaigns had already been tested in the old matabele war against loengula colebrook in particular was an oddooking creature tall spare man bodied like a weasel he was redaired ferretyed and an excellent scout but scrappier and more inarticulate in his manner of speech than any human being i had ever encountered his conversation was a series of rapid interjections jerked out at intervals and made comprehensible by a running play of gesture and attitude well yes he said when i tried to draw him out on the matabele mode of fighting not on the open never grass if you like or bushes the eyes of them the eyes he leaned eagerly forward as if looking for something see here doctor i telling you spots gleaming among the grass long grass and armed too a pair of each one to throw e raised his hand as if lancing something the other for close fighting assegais you know that the name of it only the eyes creeping creeping creeping no noise one raised waggons drawn up in laager oxen outpanned in the middle trekking all day tired out dog tired crawl crawl crawl hands and knees might be snakes a wriggle men sitting about the camp fire smoking gleam of their eyes under the waggons nearer nearer nearer then the throwing ones in your midst shower of right and left alloa stand by boys look up see swarming black like ants over the waggons inside the laager snatch up rifles all up oxen stampeding men running blacks sticking like pigs in the back with their assegais bad job the whole thing don care for it myself very tough ns to fight if they once break laager then you should never let them get to close quarters i suggested catching the general drift of his inarticulate swift pictures youe a square man you are doctor there you touch the spot never let get at close quarters sentries reep past outposts rawl between had forbes and wilson like that cut off perdition but maxims will do it maxims never let em get near sweep the ground all round durned hard though to know just when theye coming a night two nights all clear only waste ammunition third they swarm like bees break laager all over this was not exactly an agreeable picture of what we had to expect he more so as our particular laager happened to have no maxims however we kept a sharp lookout for those gleaming eyes in the long grass of which colebrook warned us their flashing light was the one thing to be seen at night above all when the black bodies could crawl unperceived through the tall dry herbage on our first night out we had no adventures we watched by turns outside relieving sentry from time to time while those of us who slept within the laager slept on the bare ground with our arms beside us nobody spoke much the tension was too great every moment we expected an attack of the enemy next day news reached us by scouts from all the other laagers none of them had been attacked but in all there was a deep halfnstinctive belief that the matabele in force were drawing step by step closer and closer around us loengula old impis or native regiments had gathered together once more under their own indunas en trained and drilled in all the arts and ruses of savage warfare on their own ground and among their native scrub those rude strategists are formidable they know the country and how to fight in it we had nothing to oppose to them but a handful of the new matabeleland police an old regular soldier or two and a raw crowd of volunteers most of whom like myself had never before really handled a rifle that afternoon the major in command decided to send out the two american scouts to scour the grass and discover if possible how near our lines the matabele had penetrated i begged hard to be permitted to accompany them i wanted if i could to get evidence against sebastian or at least to learn whether he was still directing and assisting the enemy at first the scouts laughed at my request but when i told them privately that i believed i had a clue against the white traitor who had caused the revolt and that i wished to identify him they changed their tone and began to think there might be something in it experience colebrook asked in his brief shorthand of speech running his ferret eyes over me none i answered but a noiseless tread and a capacity for crawling through holes in hedges which may perhaps be useful he glanced inquiry at doolittle who was a shorter and stouter man with a knack of getting over obstacles by sheer forcefulness hands and knees he said abruptly in the imperative mood pointing to a clump of dry grass with thorny bushes ringed about it i went down on my hands and knees and threaded my way through the long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as i could the two old hands watched me when i emerged several yards off much to their surprise colebrook turned to doolittle might answer he said curtly major says hoose your own men anyhow if they catch him nobody fault but his wants to go will do it we set out through the long grass together walking erect at first till we had got some distance from the laager and then creeping as the matabele themselves creep without displacing the grasslowers for a mere wave on top would have betrayed us at once to the quick eyes of those observant savages we crept on for a mile or so at last colebrook turned to me one finger on his lips his ferret eyes gleamed we were approaching a wooded hill all interspersed with boulders kaffirs here he whispered low as if he knew by instinct how he knew i cannot tell he seemed almost to scent them we stole on farther going more furtively than ever now i could notice by this time that there were waggons in front and could hear men speaking in them i wanted to proceed but colebrook held up one warning hand won do he said shortly in a low tone only myself danger ahead stop here and wait for me doolittle and myself waited colebrook kept on cautiously squirming his long body in sinuous waves like a lizard through the grass and was soon lost to us no snake could have been lither we waited with ears intent one minute two minutes many minutes passed we could catch the voices of the kaffirs in the bush all round they were speaking freely but what they said i did not know as i had picked up only a very few words of the matabele language it seemed hours while we waited still as mice in our ambush and alert i began to think colebrook must have been lost or killed o long was he gone nd that we must return without him at last e leaned forward muffled movement in the grass ahead a slight wave at the base then it divided below bit by bit while the tops remained stationary a weaselike body slank noiselessly through finger on lips once more colebrook glided beside us we turned and crawled back stifling our very pulses for many minutes none of us spoke but we heard in our rear a loud cry and a shaking of assegais the kaffirs behind us were yelling frightfully they must have suspected something some movement in the tufted heads of grass for they spread abroad shouting we halted holding our breath after a time however the noise died down they were moving another way we crept on again stealthily when at last after many minutes we found ourselves beyond a sheltering belt of brushwood we ventured to rise and speak well i asked of colebrook did you discover anything he nodded assent couldn see him he said shortly but he there right enough white man heard talk of him what did they say i asked eagerly said he had a white skin but his heart was a kaffir great induna leader of many impis prophet wise weather doctor friend of old moselekatse destroy the white men from over the big water restore the land to the matabele kill all in salisbury especially the white women witches witches they give charms to the men cook lions hearts for them make them brave with loverinks they said that i exclaimed taken aback kill all the white women yes kill all white witches every one the young ones worst word of the great induna and you could not see him crept near waggons close fellow himself inside heard his voice spoke english with a little matabele kaffir boy who was servant at the mission interpreted what sort of voice like this and i imitated sebastian cold clearut tone as well as i was able the man that him doctor youe got him down to the ground the very voice heard him giving orders that settled the question i was certain of it now sebastian was with the insurgents we made our way back to our laager flung ourselves down and slept a little on the ground before taking our turn in the fatigues of the night watch our horses were loosely tied ready for any sudden alarm about midnight we three were sitting with others about the fire talking low to one another all at once doolittle sprang up alert and eager look out boys he cried pointing his hands under the waggons what wriggling in the grass there i looked and saw nothing our sentries were posted outside about a hundred yards apart walking up and down till they met and exchanging all well aloud at each meeting they should have been stationary one of our scouts exclaimed looking out at them it easier for the matabele to see them so when they walk up and down moving against the sky the major ought to have posted them where it wouldn have been so simple for a kaffir to see them and creep in between them too late now boys colebrook burst out with a rare effort of articulateness call back the sentries major the blacks have broken line hold there theye in upon us even as he spoke i followed his eager pointing hand with my eyes and just descried among the grass two gleaming objects seen under the hollow of one of the waggons two then two then two again and behind whole pairs of them they looked like twin stars but they were eyes black eyes reflecting the starlight and the red glare of the campire they crept on tortuously in serpentine curves through the long dry grasses i could feel rather than see that they were matabele crawling prone on their bellies and trailing their snakeike way between the dark jungle quick as thought i raised my rifle and blazed away at the foremost so did several others but the major shouted angrily who fired don shoot boys till you hear the word of command back sentries to laager not a shot till theye safe inside youl hit your own people almost before he said it the sentries darted back the matabele crouching on hands and knees in the long grass had passed between them unseen a wild moment followed i can hardly describe it the whole thing was so new to me and took place so quickly hordes of black human ants seemed to surge up all at once over and under the waggons assegais whizzed through the air or gleamed brandished around one our men fell back to the centre of the laager and formed themselves hastily under the major orders then a pause a deadly fire once twice thrice we volleyed the matabele fell by dozens ut they came on by hundreds as fast as we fired and mowed down one swarm fresh swarms seemed to spring from the earth and stream over the waggons others appeared to grow up almost beneath our feet as they wormed their way on their faces along the ground between the wheels squirmed into the circle and then rose suddenly erect and naked in front of us meanwhile they yelled and shouted clashing their spears and shields the oxen bellowed the rifles volleyed it was a pandemonium of sound in an orgy of gloom darkness lurid flame blood wounds death horror yet in the midst of all this hubbub i could not help admiring the cool military calm and selfontrol of our major his voice rose clear above the confused tumult steady boys steady don fire at random pick each your likeliest man and aim at him deliberately that right easy asy shoot at leisure and don waste ammunition he stood as if he were on parade in the midst of this palpitating turmoil of savages some of us encouraged by his example mounted the waggons and shot from the tops at our approaching assailants how long the hurlyurly went on i cannot say we fired fired fired and kaffirs fell like sheep yet more kaffirs rose fresh from the long grass to replace them they swarmed with greater ease now over the covered waggons across the mangled and writhing bodies of their fellows for the dead outside made an inclined plane for the living to mount by but the enemy were getting less numerous i thought and less anxious to fight the steady fire told on them byndy with a little halt for the first time they wavered all our men now mounted the waggons and began to fire on them in regular volleys as they came up the evil effects of the surprise were gone by this time we were acting with coolness and obeying orders but several of our people dropped close beside me pierced through with assegais all at once as if a panic had burst over them the matabele with one mind stopped dead short in their advance and ceased fighting till that moment no number of deaths seemed to make any difference to them men fell disabled others sprang up from the ground by magic but now of a sudden their courage flagged hey faltered gave way broke and shambled in a body at last as one man they turned and fled many of them leapt up with a loud cry from the long grass where they were skulking flung away their big shields with the white thongs interlaced and ran for dear life black crouching figures through the dense dry jungle they held their assegais still but did not dare to use them it was a flight pellell nd the devil take the hindmost not until then had i leisure to think and to realise my position this was the first and only time i had ever seen a battle i am a bit of a coward i believe ike most other men hough i have courage enough to confess it and i expected to find myself terribly afraid when it came to fighting instead of that to my immense surprise once the matabele had swarmed over the laager and were upon us in their thousands i had no time to be frightened the absolute necessity for keeping cool for loading and reloading for aiming and firing for beating them off at close quarters this so occupied one mind and still more one hands that one couldn find room for any personal terrors they are breaking over there they will overpower us yonder they are faltering now those thoughts were so uppermost in one head and one arms were so alert that only after the enemy gave way and began to run at full pelt could a man find breathingpace to think of his own safety then the thought occurred to me i have been through my first fight and come out of it alive after all i was a deal less afraid than i expected that took but a second however next instant awaking to the altered circumstances we were after them at full speed accompanying them on their way back to their kraals in the uplands with a running fire as a farewell attention as we broke laager in pursuit of them by the uncertain starlight we saw a sight which made us boil with indignation a mounted man turned and fled before them he seemed their leader unseen till then he was dressed like a european all thin unbending in a greyishhite suit he rode a good horse and sat it well his air was commanding even as he turned and fled in the general rout from that lost battle i seized colebrook arm almost speechless with anger the white man i cried the traitor he did not answer a word but with a set face of white rage loosed his horse from where it was tethered among the waggons at the same moment i loosed mine so did doolittle quick as thought but silently we led them out all three where the laager was broken i clutched my mare mane and sprang to the stirrup to pursue our enemy my sorrel bounded off like a bird the fugitive had a good two minutes start of us but our horses were fresh while his had probably been ridden all day i patted my pony neck she responded with a ringing neigh of joy we tore after the outlaw all three of us abreast i felt a sort of fierce delight in the reaction after the fighting our ponies galloped wildly over the plain we burst out into the night never heeding the matabele whom we passed on the open in panictricken retreat i noticed that many of them in their terror had even flung away their shields and their assegais it was a mad chase across the dark veldt e three neck to neck against that one desperate runaway we rode all we knew i dug my heels into my sorrel flanks and she responded bravely the tables were turned now on our traitor since the afternoon of the massacre he was the pursued and we were the pursuers we felt we must run him down and punish him for his treachery at a breakneck pace we stumbled over low bushes we grazed big boulders we rolled down the sides of steep ravines but we kept him in sight all the time dim and black against the starry sky slowly slowly es yes e gained upon him my pony led now the mysterious white man rode and rode ead bent neck forward ut never looked behind him bit by bit we lessened the distance between us as we drew near him at last doolittle called out to me in a warning voice take care doctor have your revolvers ready he driven to bay now as we approach hel fire at us then it came home to me in a flash i felt the truth of it he dare not fire i cried he dare not turn towards us he cannot show his face if he did we might recognise him on we rode still gaining now now i cried we shall catch him even as i leaned forward to seize his rein the fugitive without checking his horse without turning his head drew his revolver from his belt and raising his hand fired behind him at random he fired towards us on the chance the bullet whizzed past my ear not hitting anyone we scattered right and left still galloping free and strong we did not return his fire as i had told the others of my desire to take him alive we might have shot his horse but the risk of hitting the rider coupled with the confidence we felt of eventually hunting him to earth restrained us it was the great mistake we made he had gained a little by his shots but we soon caught it up once more i said we are on him a minute later we were pulled up short before an impenetrable thicket of prickly shrubs through which i saw at once it would have been quite impossible to urge our staggering horses the other man of course reached it before us with his mare last breath he must have been making for it indeed of set purpose for the second he arrived at the edge of the thicket he slipped off his tired pony and seemed to dive into the bush as a swimmer dives off a rock into the water we have him now i cried in a voice of triumph and colebrook echoed we have him we sprang down quickly take him alive if you can i exclaimed remembering hilda advice let us find out who he is and have him properly tried and hanged at buluwayo don give him a soldier death all he deserves is a murderer you stop here colebrook said briefly flinging his bridle to doolittle to hold doctor and i follow him thick bush knows the ways of it revolvers ready i handed my sorrel to doolittle he stopped behind holding the three foamespattered and panting horses while colebrook and i dived after our fugitive into the matted bushes the thicket as i have said was impenetrable above but it was burrowed at its base by overround runs of some wild animal ot i think a very large one they were just like the runs which rabbits make among gorse and heather only on a bigger scale igger even than a fox or badger by crouching and bending our backs we could crawl through them with difficulty into the scrubby tangle it was hard work creeping the runs divided soon colebrook felt with his hands on the ground i can make out the spoor he muttered after a minute he has gone on this way we tracked him a little distance in crawling at times and rising now and again where the runs opened out on to the air for a moment the spoor was doubtful and the tunnels tortuous i felt the ground from time to time but could not be sure of the tracks with my fingers i was not a trained scout like colebrook or doolittle we wriggled deeper into the tangle something stirred once or twice it was not far from me i was uncertain whether it was him ebastian r a kaffir earthog the animal which seemed likeliest to have made the burrows was he going to elude us even now would he turn upon us with a knife if so could we hold him at last when we had pushed our way some distance in we heard a wild cry from outside it was doolittle voice quick quick out again the man will escape he has come back on his tracks and rounded i saw our mistake at once we had left our companion out there alone rendered helpless by the care of all three horses colebrook said never a word he was a man of action he turned with instinctive haste and followed our own spoor back again with his hands and knees to the opening in the thicket by which we had first entered before we could reach it however two shots rang out clear in the direction where we had left poor doolittle and the horses then a sharp cry broke the stillness he cry of a wounded man we redoubled our pace we knew we were outwitted when we reached the open we saw at once by the uncertain light what had happened the fugitive was riding away on my own little sorrel iding for dear life not back the way we came from salisbury but sideways across the veldt towards chimoio and the portuguese seaports the other two horses riderless and terrified were scampering with loose heels over the dark plain doolittle was not to be seen he lay a black lump among the black bushes about him we looked around for him and found him he was severely i may even say dangerously wounded the bullet had lodged in his right side we had to catch our two horses and ride them back with our wounded man leading the fugitive mare in tow all blown and breathless i stuck to the fugitive mare it was the one clue we had now against him but sebastian if it was sebastian had ridden off scotree i understood his game at a glance he had got the better of us once more he would make for the coast by the nearest road give himself out as a settler escaped from the massacre and catch the next ship for england or the cape now this coup had failed him doolittle had not seen the traitor face the man rose from the bush he said shot him seized the pony and rode off in a second with ruthless haste he was tall and thin but erect hat was all the wounded scout could tell us about his assailant and that was not enough to identify sebastian all danger was over we rode back to salisbury the first words hilda said when she saw me were well he has got away from you yes how did you know i read it in your step but i guessed as much before he is so very keen and you started too confident but you don know what steamer it is no matter that only makes the coincidence all the odder whatever the name of the ship may be when you get on board i have a presentiment that you will be surprised to find me there she looked up at me with a gathering film in her eyes hubert you are irrepressible i am my dear child so you may as well spare yourself the needless trouble of trying to repress me if you rub a piece of iron on a loadstone it becomes magnetic so i think i must have begun to acquire some part of hilda own prophetic strain for sure enough a few weeks later we both of us found ourselves on the german east african steamer kaiser wilhelm on our way to aden xactly as i had predicted which goes to prove that there is really something after all in presentiments since you persist in accompanying me hilda said to me as we sat in our chairs on deck the first evening out i see what i must do i must invent some plausible and ostensible reason for our travelling together we are not travelling together i answered we are travelling by the same steamer that is all xactly like the rest of our fellowassengers i decline to be dragged into this imaginary partnership now do be serious hubert i am going to invent an object in life for us what object how can i tell yet i must wait and see what turns up when we tranship at aden and find out what people are going on to bombay with us i shall probably discover some nice married lady to whom i can attach myself and am i to attach myself to her too my dear boy i never asked you to come you came unbidden you must manage for yourself as best you may but i leave much to the chapter of accidents we never know what will turn up till it turns up in the end everything comes at last you know to him that waits and yet i put in with a meditative air i have never observed that waiters are so much better off than the rest of the community they seem to me don talk nonsense it is you who are wandering from the question now please return to it i returned at once so i am to depend on what turns up yes leave that to me when we see our fellowassengers on the bombay steamer i shall soon discover some ostensible reason why we two should be travelling through india with one of them well you are a witch hilda i answered i found that out long ago but if you succeed between here and bombay in inventing a mission i shall begin to believe you are even more of a witch than i ever thought you at aden we changed into a p and o steamer our first evening out on our second cruise was a beautiful one the bland indian ocean wore its sweetest smile for us we sat on deck after dinner a lady with a husband came up from the cabin while we sat and gazed at the placid sea i was smoking a quiet digestive cigar hilda was seated in her deck chair next to me the lady with the husband looked about her for a vacant space on which to place the chair a steward was carrying for her there was plenty of room on the quartereck i could not imagine why she gazed about her with such obtrusive caution she inspected the occupants of the various chairs around with deliberate scrutiny through a longandled tortoisehell optical abomination none of them seemed to satisfy her after a minute effort during which she also muttered a few words very low to her husband she selected an empty spot midway between our group and the most distant group on the other side of us in other words she sat as far away from everybody present as the necessarily restricted area of the quartereck permitted hilda glanced at me and smiled i snatched a quick look at the lady again she was dressed with an amount of care and a smartness of detail that seemed somewhat uncalled for on the indian ocean a cruise on a p and o steamer is not a garden party her chair was most luxurious and had her name painted on it back and front in very large letters with undue obtrusiveness i read it from where i sat lady meadowcroft the owner of the chair was tolerably young not bad looking and most expensively attired her face had a certain vacant languid half ennuyee air which i have learned to associate with women of the nouveauiche type omen with small brains and restless minds habitually plunged in a vortex of gaiety and miserable when left for a passing moment to their own resources hilda rose from her chair and walked quietly forward towards the bow of the steamer i rose too and accompanied her well she said with a faint touch of triumph in her voice when we had got out of earshot well what i answered unsuspecting i told you everything turned up at the end she said confidently look at the lady nose it does turn up at the end ertainly i answered glancing back at her but i hardly see hubert you are growing dull you were not so at nathaniel it is the lady herself who has turned up not her nose hough i grant you that turns up too he lady i require for our tour in india the not impossible chaperon her nose tells you that her nose in part but her face as a whole too her dress her chair her mental attitude to things in general my dear hilda you can mean to tell me you have divined her whole nature at a glance by magic not wholly at a glance i saw her come on board you know he transhipped from some other line at aden as we did and i have been watching her ever since yes i think i have unravelled her you have been astonishingly quick i cried perhaps ut then you see there is so little to unravel some books we all know you must hew and digest they can only be read slowly but some you can glance at skim and skip the mere turning of the pages tells you what little worth knowing there is in them she doesn look profound i admitted casting an eye at her meaningless small features as we paced up and down i incline to agree you might easily skim her skim her nd learn all the table of contents is so short you see in the first place she is extremely xclusive she prides herself on her xclusiveness it and her shoddy title are probably all she has to pride herself upon and she works them both hard she is a sham great lady as hilda spoke lady meadowcroft raised a feebly querulous voice steward this won do i can smell the engine here move my chair i must go on further if you go on further that way my lady the steward answered goodumouredly but with a manervant deference for any sort of title youl smell the galley where theye cooking the dinner i don know which your ladyship would like best he engine or the galley the languid figure leaned back in the chair with an air of resignation i sure i don know why they cook the dinners up so high she murmured pettishly to her husband why can they stick the kitchens underground n the hold i mean nstead of bothering us up here on deck with them the husband was a big burly roughndeady yorkshireman tout somewhat pompous about forty with hair wearing bald on the forehead the personification of the successful business man my dear emmie he said in a loud voice with a north country accent the cooks have got to live theye got to live like the rest of us i can never persuade you that the hands must always be humoured if you don humour they won work for you it a poor tale when the hands won work even with galleys on deck the life of a seaook is not generally thowt an enviable position is not a happy one ot a happy one as the fellah says in the opera you must humour your cooks if you stuck in the hold you get no dinner at all hat the long and the short of it the languid lady turned away with a sickly disappointed air then they ought to have a conscription or something she said pouting her lips the government ought to take it in hand and manage it somehow it bad enough having to go by these beastly steamers to india at all without having one breath poisoned by the rest of the sentence died away inaudibly in a general murmur of ineffective grumbling why do you think she is exclusive i asked hilda as we strolled on towards the stern out of the spoilt child hearing why didn you notice he looked about her when she came on deck to see whether there was anybody who was anybody sitting there whom she might put her chair near but the governor of madras hadn come up from his cabin yet and the wife of the chief commissioner of oude had three civilians hanging about her seat and the daughters of the commandernhief drew their skirts away as she passed so she did the next best thing at as far apart as she could from the common herd meaning all the rest of us if you can mingle at once with the best people you can at least assert your exclusiveness negatively by declining to associate with the mere multitude now hilda that is the first time i have ever known you to show any feminine illature illature not at all i am merely trying to arrive at the lady character for my own guidance i rather like her poor little thing don i tell you she will do so far from objecting to her i mean to go the round of india with her you have decided quickly well you see if you insist upon accompanying me i must have a chaperon and lady meadowcroft will do as well as anybody else in fact being beadied she will do a little better from the point of view of society though that is a detail the great matter is to fix upon a possible chaperon at once and get her well in hand before we arrive at bombay but she seems so complaining i interposed i afraid if you take her on youl get terribly bored with her if she takes me on you mean she not a ladyaid though i intend to go with her and she may as well give in first as last for i going now see how nice i am to you sir ie provided you too with a post in her suite as you will come with me no never mind asking me what it is just yet all things come to him who waits and if you will only accept the post of waiter i mean all things to come to you all things hilda i asked meaningly with a little tremor of delight she looked at me with a sudden passing tenderness in her eyes yes all things hubert all things but we mustn talk of that hough i begin to see my way clearer now you shall be rewarded for your constancy at last dear knightrrant as to my chaperon i not afraid of her boring me she bores herself poor lady one can see that just to look at her but she will be much less bored if she has us two to travel with what she needs is constant companionship bright talk excitement she has come away from london where she swims with the crowd she has no resources of her own no work no head no interests accustomed to a whirl of foolish gaieties she wearies her small brain thrown back upon herself she bores herself at once because she has nothing interesting to tell herself she absolutely requires somebody else to interest her she can even amuse herself with a book for three minutes together see she has a yellowacked french novel now and she is only able to read five lines at a time then she gets tired and glances about her listlessly what she wants is someone gay laid on to divert her all the time from her own inanity hilda how wonderfully quick you are at reading these things i see you are right but i could never have guessed so much myself from such small premises well what can you expect my dear boy a girl like this brought up in a country rectory a girl of no intellect busy at home with the fowls and the pastry and the mothers meetings uddenly married offhand to a wealthy man and deprived of the occupations which were her salvation in life to be plunged into the whirl of a london season and stranded at its end for want of the diversions which by dint of use have become necessaries of life to her now hilda you are practising upon my credulity you can possibly tell from her look that she was brought up in a country rectory of course not you forget there my memory comes in i simply remember it you remember it how why just in the same way as i remembered your name and your mother when i was first introduced to you i saw a notice once in the births deaths and marriages t st alphege millington by the rev hugh clitheroe a father of the bride peter gubbins esq of the laurels middleston to emilia frances third daughter of the rev hugh clitheroe rector of millington clitheroe ubbins what on earth has that to do with it that would be mrs gubbins this is lady meadowcroft the same article as the shopmen say nly under a different name a year or two later i read a notice in the times that ivor de courcy meadowcroft of the laurels middleston mayorlect of the borough of middleston hereby give notice that i have this day discontinued the use of the name peter gubbins by which i was formerly known and have assumed in lieu thereof the style and title of ivor de courcy meadowcroft by which i desire in future to be known a month or two later again i happened to light upon a notice in the telegraph that the prince of wales had opened a new hospital for incurables at middleston and that the mayor mr ivor meadowcroft had received an intimation of her majesty intention of conferring upon him the honour of knighthood now what do you make of it putting two and two together i answered with my eye on our subject and taking into consideration the lady face and manner i should incline to suspect that she was the daughter of a poor parson with the usual large family in inverse proportion to his means that she unexpectedly made a good match with a very wealthy manufacturer who had raised himself and that she was puffed up accordingly with a sense of selfmportance exactly he is a millionaire or something very like it and being an ambitious girl as she understands ambition she got him to stand for the mayoralty i don doubt in the year when the prince of wales was going to open the royal incurables on purpose to secure him the chance of a knighthood then she said very reasonably won be lady gubbins ir peter gubbins there an aristocratic name for you nd by a stroke of his pen he straightway disubbinised himself and emerged as sir ivor de courcy meadowcroft really hilda you know everything about everybody and what do you suppose theye going to india for now youe asked me a hard one i haven the faintest notion and yet let me think how is this for a conjecture sir ivor is interested in steel rails i believe and in railway plant generally i almost sure ie seen his name in connection with steel rails in reports of public meetings there a new government railway now being built on the nepaul frontier ne of these strategic railways i think they call them t mentioned in the papers we got at aden he might be going out for that we can watch his conversation and see what part of india he talks about they don seem inclined to give us much chance of talking i objected no they are very exclusive but i very exclusive too and i mean to give them a touch of my exclusiveness i venture to predict that before we reach bombay theyl be going down on their knees and imploring us to travel with them at table as it happened from next morning breakfast the meadowcrofts sat next to us hilda was on one side of me lady meadowcroft on the other and beyond her again bluff yorkshire sir ivor with his cold hard honest blue north country eyes and his dignified pompous english breaking down at times into a north country colloquialism they talked chiefly to each other acting on hilda instructions i took care not to engage in conversation with our exclusive neighbour except so far as the absolute necessities of the table compelled me i troubled her for the salt in the most frigid voice may i pass you the potato salad became on my lips a barrier of separation lady meadowcroft marked and wondered people of her sort are so anxious to ingratiate themselves with all the best people that if they find you are wholly unconcerned about the privilege of conversation with a titled person they instantly judge you to be a distinguished character as the days rolled on lady meadowcroft voice began to melt by degrees once she asked me quite civilly to send round the ice she even saluted me on the third day out with a polite goodorning doctor still i maintained by hilda advic my dignified reserve and took my seat severely with a cold goodorning i behaved like a highlass consultant who expects to be made physician in ordinary to her majesty at lunch that day hilda played her first card with delicious unconsciousness unconsciousness for when she chose she was a consummate actress she played it at a moment when lady meadowcroft who by this time was burning with curiosity on our account had paused from her talk with her husband to listen to us i happened to say something about some oriental curios belonging to an aunt of mine in london hilda seized the opportunity what did you say was her name she asked blandly why lady tepping i answered in perfect innocence she has a fancy for these things you know she brought a lot of them home with her from burma as a matter of fact as i have already explained my poor dear aunt is an extremely commonplace old army widow whose husband happened to get knighted among the new year honours for some brush with the natives on the shan frontier but lady meadowcroft was at the stage where a title is a title and the discovery that i was the nephew of a titled person evidently interested her i could feel rather than see that she glanced significantly aside at sir ivor and that sir ivor in return made a little movement of his shoulders equivalent to i told you so now hilda knew perfectly well that the aunt of whom i spoke was lady tepping so i felt sure that she had played this card of malice prepense to pique lady meadowcroft but lady meadowcroft herself seized the occasion with inartistic avidity she had hardly addressed us as yet at the sound of the magic passport she pricked up her ears and turned to me suddenly burma she said as if to conceal the true reason for her change of front burma i had a cousin there once he was in the gloucestershire regiment indeed i answered my tone was one of utter unconcern in her cousin history miss wade will you take bombay ducks with your curry in public i thought it wise under the circumstances to abstain from calling her hilda it might lead to misconceptions people might suppose we were more than fellowravellers you have had relations in burma lady meadowcroft persisted i manifested a desire to discontinue the conversation yes i answered coldly my uncle commanded there commanded there really ivor do you hear dr cumberledge uncle commanded in burma a faint intonation on the word commanded drew unobtrusive attention to its social importance may i ask what was his name y cousin was there you see an insipid smile we may have friends in common he was a certain sir malcolm tepping i blurted out staring hard at my plate tepping i think i have heard dick speak of him ivor your cousin sir ivor answered with emphatic dignity is certain to have mixed with nobbut the highest officials in burma yes i sure dick used to speak of a certain sir malcolm my cousin name dr cumberledge was maltby aptain richard maltby indeed i answered with an icy stare i cannot pretend to the pleasure of having met him be exclusive to the exclusive and they burn to know you from that moment forth lady meadowcroft pestered us with her endeavours to scrape acquaintance instead of trying how far she could place her chair from us she set it down as near us as politeness permitted she entered into conversation whenever an opening afforded itself and we two stood off haughtily she even ventured to question me about our relation to one another miss wade is your cousin i suppose she suggested oh dear no i answered with a glassy smile we are not connected in any way but you are travelling together merely as you and i are travelling together ellowassengers on the same steamer still you have met before yes certainly miss wade was a nurse at st nathaniel in london where i was one of the house doctors when i came on board at cape town after some months in south africa i found she was going by the same steamer to india which was literally true to have explained the rest would have been impossible at least to anyone who did not know the whole of hilda history and what are you both going to do when you get to india really lady meadowcroft i said severely i have not asked miss wade what she is going to do if you inquire of her pointlank as you have inquired of me i dare say she will tell you for myself i am just a globerotter amusing myself i only want to have a look round at india then you are not going out to take an appointment by george emmie the burly yorkshireman put in with an air of annoyance you are crossuestioning dr cumberledge nowt less than crossuestioning him i waited a second no i answered slowly i have not been practising of late i am looking about me i travel for enjoyment that made her think better of me she was of the kind indeed who think better of a man if they believe him to be idle she dawdled about all day on deck chairs herself seldom even reading and she was eager now to drag hilda into conversation hilda resisted she had found a volume in the library which immensely interested her what are you reading miss wade lady meadowcroft cried at last quite savagely it made her angry to see anybody else pleased and occupied when she herself was listless a delightful book hilda answered the buddhist praying wheel by william simpson lady meadowcroft took it from her and turned the pages over with a languid air looks awfully dull she observed with a faint smile at last returning it it charming hilda retorted glancing at one of the illustrations it explains so much it shows one why one turns round one chair at cards for luck and why when a church is consecrated the bishop walks three times about it sunwise our bishop is a dreadfully prosy old gentleman lady meadowcroft answered gliding off at a tangent on a personality as is the wont of her kind he had oh such a dreadful quarrel with my father over the rules of the st alphege schools at millington indeed hilda answered turning once more to her book lady meadowcroft looked annoyed it would never have occurred to her that within a few weeks she was to owe her life to that very abstruse work and what hilda had read in it that afternoon as we watched the flying fish from the ship side hilda said to me abruptly my chaperon is an extremely nervous woman nervous about what about disease chiefly she has the temperament that dreads infection nd therefore catches it why do you think so haven you noticed that she often doubles her thumb under her fingers olds her fist across it o specially when anybody talks about anything alarming if the conversation happens to turn on jungle fever or any subject like that down goes her thumb instantly and she clasps her fist over it with a convulsive squeeze at the same time too her face twitches i know what that trick means she horribly afraid of tropical diseases though she never says so and you attach importance to her fear of course i count upon it as probably our chief means of catching and fixing her as how she shook her head and quizzed me wait and see you are a doctor i a trained nurse before twentyour hours i foresee she will ask us she is sure to ask us now she has learned that you are lady tepping nephew and that i am acquainted with several of the best people that evening about ten olock sir ivor strolled up to me in the smokingoom with affected unconcern he laid his hand on my arm and drew me aside mysteriously the ship doctor was there playing a quiet game of poker with a few of the passengers i beg your pardon dr cumberledge he began in an undertone could you come outside with me a minute lady meadowcroft has sent me up to you with a message i followed him on to the open deck it is quite impossible my dear sir i said shaking my head austerely for i divined his errand i can go and see lady meadowcroft medical etiquette you know the constant and salutary rule of the profession why not he asked astonished the ship carries a surgeon i replied in my most precise tone he is a duly qualified gentleman very able in his profession and he ought to inspire your wife with confidence i regard this vessel as dr boyell practice and all on board it as virtually his patients sir ivor face fell but lady meadowcroft is not at all well he answered looking piteous and he can endure the ship doctor such a common man you know his loud voice disturbs her you must have noticed that my wife is a lady of exceptionally delicate nervous organisation he hesitated beamed on me and played his trump card she dislikes being attended by owt but a gentleman if a gentleman is also a medical man i answered his sense of duty towards his brother practitioners would of course prevent him from interfering in their proper sphere or putting upon them the unmerited slight of letting them see him preferred before them then you positively refuse he asked wistfully drawing back i could see he stood in a certain dread of that imperious little woman i conceded a point i will go down in twenty minutes i admitted looking grave not just now lest i annoy my colleague nd i will glance at lady meadowcroft in an unprofessional way if i think her case demands treatment i will tell dr boyell and i returned to the smokingoom and took up a novel twenty minutes later i knocked at the door of the lady private cabin with my best bedside manner in full play as i suspected she was nervous othing more y mere smile reassured her i observed that she held her thumb fast doubled under in her fist all the time i was questioning her as hilda had said and i also noticed that the fingers closed about it convulsively at first but gradually relaxed as my voice restored confidence she thanked me profusely and was really grateful on deck next day she was very communicative they were going to make the regular tour first she said but were to go on to the tibetan frontier at the end where sir ivor had a contract to construct a railway in a very wild region tigers natives oh she didn mind either of them but she was told that that district hat did they call it the terai or something as terribly unwholesome fever was whatouayallt there es endemic hat was the word oh thank you dr cumberledge she hated the very name of fever now you miss wade i suppose with an awestruck smile are not in the least afraid of it hilda looked up at her calmly not in the least she answered i have nursed hundreds of cases oh my how dreadful and never caught it never i am not afraid you see i wish i wasn hundreds of cases it makes one ill to think of it and all successfully almost all of them you don tell your patients stories when theye ill about your other cases who died do you lady meadowcroft went on with a quick little shudder hilda face by this time was genuinely sympathetic oh never she answered with truth that would be very bad nursing one object in treating a case is to make one patient well so one naturally avoids any sort of subject that might be distressing or alarming you really mean it her face was pleading why of course i try to make my patients my friends i talk to them cheerfully i amuse them and distract them i get them away as far as i can from themselves and their symptoms oh what a lovely person to have about one when one ill the languid lady exclaimed ecstatically i should like to send for you if i wanted nursing but there t always so of course with a real lady common nurses frighten one so i wish i could always have a lady to nurse me a person who sympathises hat is the really important thing hilda answered in her quiet voice one must find out first one patient temperament you are nervous i can see she laid one hand on her new friend arm you need to be kept amused and engaged when you are ill what you require most is nsight nd sympathy the little fist doubled up again the vacant face grew positively sweet that just it you have hit it how clever you are i want all that i suppose miss wade you never go out for private nursing never hilda answered you see lady meadowcroft i don nurse for a livelihood i have means of my own i took up this work as an occupation and a sphere in life i haven done anything yet but hospital nursing lady meadowcroft drew a slight sigh what a pity she murmured slowly it does seem hard that your sympathies should all be thrown away so to speak on a horrid lot of wretched poor people instead of being spent on your own equals ho would so greatly appreciate them i think i can venture to say the poor appreciate them too hilda answered bridling up a little or there was nothing she hated so much as classrejudices besides they need sympathy more they have fewer comforts i should not care to give up attending my poor people for the sake of the idle rich the set phraseology of the country rectory recurred to lady meadowcroft our poorer brethren and so forth oh of course she answered with the mechanical acquiescence such women always give to moral platitudes one must do one best for the poor i know or conscience sake and all that it our duty and we all try hard to do it but theye so terribly ungrateful don you think so do you know miss wade in my father parish hilda cut her short with a sunny smile alf contemptuous toleration half genuine pity we are all ungrateful she said but the poor i think the least so i sure the gratitude ie often had from my poor women at st nathaniel has made me sometimes feel really ashamed of myself i had done so little nd they thanked me so much for it which only shows lady meadowcroft broke in that one ought always to have a lady to nurse one ca marche hilda said to me with a quiet smile a few minutes after when her ladyship had disappeared in her fluffy robe down the companionadder yes ca marche i answered in an hour or two you will have succeeded in landing your chaperon and what is most amusing landed her too hilda just by being yourself etting her see frankly the actual truth of what you think and feel about her and about everyone i could not do otherwise hilda answered growing grave i must be myself or die for it my method of angling consists in showing myself just as i am you call me an actress but i am not really one i am only a woman who can use her personality for her own purposes if i go with lady meadowcroft it will be a mutual advantage i shall really sympathise with her for i can see the poor thing is devoured with nervousness but do you think you will be able to stand her i asked oh dear yes she not a bad little thing au fond when you get to know her it is society that has spoilt her she would have made a nice helpful motherly body if she married the curate as we neared bombay conversation grew gradually more and more indian it always does under similar circumstances a sea voyage is half retrospect half prospect it has no personal identity you leave liverpool for new york at the english standpoint and are full of what you did in london or manchester halfay over you begin to discuss american customouses and new york hotels by the time you reach sandy hook the talk is all of quick trains west and the shortest route from philadelphia to new orleans you grow by slow stages into the new attitude at malta you are still regretting europe after aden your mind dwells most on the hire of punkahallahs and the proverbial toughness of the dakungalow chicken how the plague at bombay now an inquisitive passenger inquired of the captain at dinner our last night out getting any better lady meadowcroft thumb dived between her fingers again what is there plague in bombay she asked innocently in her nervous fashion plague in bombay the captain burst out his burly voice resounding down the saloon why bless your soul mam where else would you expect it plague in bombay it been there these five years better not quite going ahead like mad theye dying by thousands a microbe i believe dr boyell the inquisitive passenger observed deferentially with due respect for medical science yes the ship doctor answered helping himself to an olive forty million microbes to each square inch of the bombay atmosphere and we are going to bombay lady meadowcroft exclaimed aghast you must have known there was plague there my dear sir ivor put in soothingly with a deprecating glance it been in all the papers but only the natives get it the thumb uncovered itself a little oh only the natives lady meadowcroft echoed relieved as if a few thousand hindus more or less would hardly be missed among the blessings of british rule in india you know ivor i never read those dreadful things in the papers i read the society news and our social diary and columns that are headed ainly about people i don care for anything but the morning post and the world and truth i hate horrors but it a blessing to think it only the natives plenty of europeans too bless your heart the captain thundered out unfeelingly why last time i was in port a nurse died at the hospital oh only a nurse lady meadowcroft began and then coloured up deeply with a side glance at hilda and lots besides nurses the captain continued positively delighted at the terror he was inspiring pucka englishmen and englishwomen bad business this plague dr cumberledge catches particularly those who are most afraid of it but it only in bombay lady meadowcroft cried clutching at the last straw i could see she was registering a mental determination to go straight upountry the moment she landed not a bit of it the captain answered with provoking cheerfulness rampaging about like a roaring lion all over india lady meadowcroft thumb must have suffered severely the nails dug into it as if it were someone else half an hour later as we were on deck in the cool of the evening the thing was settled my wife sir ivor said coming up to us with a serious face has delivered her ultimatum positively her ultimatum ie had a mort o trouble with her and now she settled either she goes back from bombay by the return steamer or else ou and miss wade must name your own terms to accompany us on our tour in case of emergencies he glanced wistfully at hilda do you think you can help us hilda made no hypocritical pretence of hanging back her nature was transparent if you wish it yes she answered shaking hands upon the bargain i only want to go about and see india i can see it quite as well with lady meadowcroft as without her nd even better it is unpleasant for a woman to travel unattached i require a chaperon and am glad to find one i will join your party paying my own hotel and travelling expenses and considering myself as engaged in case your wife should need my services for that you can pay me if you like some nominal retaining fee ive pounds or anything the money is immaterial to me i like to be useful and i sympathise with nerves but it may make your wife feel she is really keeping a hold over me if we put the arrangement on a business basis as a matter of fact whatever sum she chooses to pay i shall hand it over at once to the bombay plague hospital sir ivor looked relieved thank you ever so much he said wringing her hand warmly i thowt you were a brick and now i know it my wife says your face inspires confidence and your voice sympathy she must have you with her and you dr cumberledge i follow miss wade lead i answered in my most solemn tone with an impressive bow i too am travelling for instruction and amusement only and if it would give lady meadowcroft a greater sense of security to have a duly qualified practitioner in her suite i shall be glad on the same terms to swell your party i will pay my own way and i will allow you to name any nominal sum you please for your claim on my medical attendance if necessary i hope and believe however that our presence will so far reassure our prospective patient as to make our post in both cases a sinecure three minutes later lady meadowcroft rushed on deck and flung her arms impulsively round hilda you dear good girl she cried how sweet and kind of you i really couldn have landed if you hadn promised to come with us and dr cumberledge too so nice and friendly of you both but there it is so much pleasanter to deal with ladies and gentlemen so hilda won her point and what was best won it fairly chapter the episode of the guide who knew the country we toured all round india with the meadowcrofts and really the lady who was so very exclusive turned out not a bad little thing when once one had succeeded in breaking through the ringence with which she surrounded herself she had an endless quenchless restlessness it is true her eyes wandered aimlessly she never was happy for two minutes together unless she was surrounded by friends and was seeing something what she saw did not interest her much certainly her tastes were on the level with those of a very young child an oddooking house a queerly dressed man a tree cut into shape to look like a peacock delighted her far more than the most glorious view of the quaintest old temple still she must be seeing she could no more sit still than a fidgety child or a monkey at the zoo to be up and doing was her nature oing nothing to be sure but still doing it strenuously so we went the regulation round of delhi and agra the taj mahal and the ghats at benares at railroad speed fulfilling the whole duty of the modern globerotter lady meadowcroft looked at everything or ten minutes at a stretch then she wanted to be off to visit the next thing set down for her in her guideook as we left each town she murmured mechanically well wee seen that thank heaven and straightway went on with equal eagerness and equal boredom to see the one after it the only thing that did not bore her indeed was hilda bright talk oh miss wade she would say clasping her hands and looking up into hilda eyes with her own empty blue ones you are so funny so original don you know you never talk or think of anything like other people i can imagine how such ideas come up in your mind if i were to try all day i sure i should never hit upon them which was so perfectly true as to be a trifle obvious sir ivor not being interested in temples but in steel rails had gone on at once to his concession or contract or whatever else it was on the northast frontier leaving his wife to follow and rejoin him in the himalayas as soon as she had exhausted the sights of india so after a few dusty weeks of wear and tear on the indian railways we met him once more in the recesses of nepaul where he was busy constructing a light local line for the reigning maharajah if lady meadowcroft had been bored at allahabad and ajmere she was immensely more bored in a rough bungalow among the trackless depths of the himalayan valleys to anybody with eyes in his head indeed toloo where sir ivor had pitched his headquarters was lovely enough to keep one interested for a twelvemonth snowlad needles of rock hemmed it in on either side great deodars rose like huge tapers on the hillsides the plants and flowers were a joy to look at but lady meadowcroft did not care for flowers which one could not wear in one hair and what was the good of dressing here with no one but ivor and dr cumberledge to see one she yawned till she was tired then she began to grow peevish why ivor should want to build a railway at all in this stupid silly place she said as we sat in the veranda in the cool of evening i sure i can imagine we must go somewhere this is maddening maddening miss wade r cumberledge count upon you to discover something for me to do if i vegetate like this seeing nothing all day long but those eternal hills he clenched her little fist i shall go mad with ennui hilda had a happy thought i have a fancy to see some of these buddhist monasteries she said smiling as one smiles at a tiresome child whom one likes in spite of everything you remember i was reading that book of mr simpson on the steamer oming out curious book about the buddhist praying wheels and it made me want to see one of their temples immensely what do you say to camping out a few weeks in the hills it would be an adventure at any rate camping out lady meadowcroft exclaimed half roused from her languor by the idea of a change oh do you think that would be fun should we sleep on the ground but wouldn it be dreadfully horribly uncomfortable not half so uncomfortable as youl find yourself here at toloo in a few days emmie her husband put in grimly the rains will soon be on lass and when the rains are on by all accounts theye precious heavy hereabouts are fine rains so that a man halflooded out of his bed o nights hich won suit you my lady the poor little woman clasped her twitching hands in feeble agony oh ivor how dreadful is it what they call the mongoose or monsoon or something but if theye so bad here surely theyl be worse in the hills nd camping out too on they not if you go the right way to work ah told it never rains side o the hills the mountains stop the clouds and once youe over youe safe enough only you must take care to keep well in the maharajah territory cross the frontier side into tibet an theyl skin thee alive as soon as look at thee they don like strangers in tibet prejudiced against them somehow they pretty well skinned that young chap landor who tried to go there a year ago but ivor i don want to be skinned alive i not an please that all right lass leave that to me i can get thee a guide a man that very well acquainted with the mountains i was talking to a scientific explorer here day and he knows of a good guide who can take you anywhere hel get you the chance of seeing the inside of a buddhist monastery if you like miss wade he hand in glove with all the religion theye got in this part o the country theye got noan much but at what there is he a rare devout one we discussed the matter fully for two or three days before we made up our minds lady meadowcroft was undecided between her hatred of dulness and her haunting fear that scorpions and snakes would intrude upon our tents and beds while we were camping in the end however the desire for change carried the day she decided to dodge the rainy season by getting behind the himalayanasses in the dry region to the north of the great range where rain seldom falls the country being watered only by the melting of the snows on the high summits this decision delighted hilda who since she came to india had fallen a prey to the fashionable vice of amateur photography she took to it enthusiastically she had bought herself a firstate camera of the latest scientific pattern at bombay and ever since had spent all her time and spoiled her pretty hands in developing she was also seized with a craze for buddhism the objects that everywhere particularly attracted her were the old buddhist temples and tombs and sculptures with which india is studded of these she had taken some hundreds of views all printed by herself with the greatest care and precision but in india after all buddhism is a dead creed its monuments alone remain she was anxious to see the buddhist religion in its living state and that she could only do in these remote outlying himalayan valleys our outfit therefore included a dark tent for hilda photographic apparatus a couple of roomy tents to live and sleep in a small cookingtove a cook to look after it halfozen bearers and the highly recommended guide who knew his way about the country in three days we were ready to sir ivor great delight he was fond of his pretty wife and proud of her i believe but when once she was away from the whirl and bustle of the london that she loved it was a relief to him i fancy to pursue his work alone unhampered by her restless and querulous childishness on the morning when we were to make our start the guide who was well acquainted with the mountains turned up s villainousooking a person as i have ever set eyes on he was sullen and furtive i judged him at sight to be half hindu half tibetan he had a dark complexion between brown and tawny narrow slant eyes very small and beadylack with a cunning leer in their oblique corners a flat nose much broadened at the wings a cruel thick sensuous mouth and high cheekones the whole surmounted by a comprehensive scowl and an abundant crop of lank black hair tied up in a knot at the nape of the neck with a yellow ribbon his face was shifty his short stout form looked well adapted to mountain climbing and also to wriggling a deep scar on his left cheek did not help to inspire confidence but he was polite and civilpoken altogether a clever unscrupulous widewake soul who would serve you well if he thought he could make by it and would betray you at a pinch to the highest bidder we set out in merry mood prepared to solve all the abstruse problems of the buddhist religion our spoilt child stood the camping out better than i expected she was fretful of course and worried about trifles she missed her maid and her accustomed comforts but she minded the roughing it less on the whole than she had minded the boredom of inaction in the bungalow and being cast on hilda and myself for resources she suddenly evolved an unexpected taste for producing developing and printing photographs we took dozens as we went along of little villages on our route wooduilt villages with quaint houses and turrets and as hilda had brought her collection of prints with her for comparison of the indian and nepaulese monuments we spent the evenings after our short day march each day in arranging and collating them we had planned to be away six weeks at least in that time the monsoon would have burst and passed our guide thought we might see all that was worth seeing of the buddhist monasteries and sir ivor thought we should have fairly escaped the dreaded wet season what do you make of our guide i asked of hilda on our fourth day out i began somehow to distrust him oh he seems all right hilda answered carelessly nd her voice reassured me he a rogue of course all guides and interpreters and dragomans and the like in outfheay places always are rogues if they were honest men they would share the ordinary prejudices of their countrymen and would have nothing to do with the hated stranger but in this case our friend ram das has no end to gain by getting us into mischief if he had he wouldn scruple for a second to cut our throats but then there are too many of us he will probably try to cheat us by making preposterous charges when he gets us back to toloo but that lady meadowcroft business i don doubt sir ivor will be more than a match for him there il back one shrewd yorkshireman against any three tibetan halfastes any day youe right that he would cut our throats if it served his purpose i answered he servile and servility goes hand in hand with treachery the more i watch him the more i see coundrel written in large type on every bend of the fellow oily shoulders oh yes he a bad lot i know the cook who can speak a little english and a little tibetan as well as hindustani tells me ram das has the worst reputation of any man in the mountains but he says he a very good guide to the passes for all that and if he well paid will do what he paid for next day but one we approached at last after several short marches the neighbourhood of what our guide assured us was a buddhist monastery i was glad when he told us of it giving the place the name of a wellnown nepaulese village for to say the truth i was beginning to get frightened judging by the sun for i had brought no compass it struck me that we seemed to have been marching almost due north ever since we left toloo and i fancied such a line of march must have brought us by this time suspiciously near the tibetan frontier now i had no desire to be skinned alive as sir ivor put it i did not wish to emulate st bartholomew and others of the early christian martyrs so i was pleased to learn that we were really drawing near to kulak the first of the nepaulese buddhist monasteries to which our wellnformed guide himself a buddhist had promised to introduce us we were tramping up a beautiful high mountain valley closed round on every side by snowy peaks a brawling river ran over a rocky bed in cataracts down its midst crags rose abruptly a little in front of us halfay up the slope to the left on a ledge of rock rose a long low building with curious pyramidike roofs crowned at either end by a sort of minaret which resembled more than anything else a huge earthenware oilar this was the monastery or lamasery we had come so far to see honestly at first sight i did not feel sure it was worth the trouble our guide called a halt and turned to us with a sudden peremptory air his servility had vanished you stoppee here he said slowly in broken english while me go on to see whether lamaahibs ready to take you must ask leave from lamaahibs to visit village if no ask leave e drew his hand across his throat with a significant gesture lamaahibs cuttee head off eulopean goodness gracious lady meadowcroft cried clinging tight to hilda miss wade this is dreadful where on earth have you brought us to oh that all right hilda answered trying to soothe her though she herself began to look a trifle anxious that only ram das graphic way of putting things we sat down on a bank of trailing cluboss by the side of the rough track for it was nothing more and let our guide go on to negotiate with the lamas well toight anyhow i exclaimed looking up we shall sleep on our own mattresses with a roof over our heads these monks will find us quarters that always something we got out our basket and made tea in all moments of doubt your englishwoman makes tea as hilda said she will boil her etna on vesuvius we waited and drank our tea we drank our tea and waited a full hour passed away ram das never came back i began to get frightened at last something stirred a group of excited men in yellow robes issued forth from the monastery wound their way down the hill and approached us shouting they gesticulated as they came i could see they looked angry all at once hilda clutched my arm hubert she cried in an undertone we are betrayed i see it all now these are tibetans not nepaulese she paused a second then went on i see it all all our guide am das e had a reason after all for getting us into mischief sebastian must have tracked us he was bribed by sebastian it was he who recommended ram das to sir ivor why do you think so i asked low because for yourself these men who come are dressed in yellow that means tibetans red is the colour of the lamas in nepaul yellow in tibet and all other buddhist countries i read it in the book he buddhist praying wheel you know these are tibetan fanatics and as ram das said they will probably cut our throats for us i was thankful that hilda marvellous memory gave us even that moment for preparation and facing the difficulty i saw in a flash that she was quite right we had been inveigled across the frontier these moutis were tibetans uddhist inquisitors nemies tibet is the most jealous country on earth it allows no stranger to intrude upon its borders i had to meet the worst i stood there a single white man armed only with one revolver answerable for the lives of two english ladies and accompanied by a cringing outaste ghoorka cook and halfozen doubtful nepaulese bearers to fly was impossible we were fairly trapped there was nothing for it but to wait and put a bold face on our utter helplessness i turned to our spoilt child lady meadowcroft i said very seriously this is danger real danger now listen to me you must do as you are bid no crying no cowardice your life and ours depend upon it we must none of us give way we must pretend to be brave show one sign of fear and these people will probably cut our throats on the spot here to my immense surprise lady meadowcroft rose to the height of the situation oh as long as it isn disease she answered resignedly i not much afraid of anything i should mind the plague a great deal more than i mind a set of howling savages by that time the men in yellow robes had almost come up to us it was clear they were boiling over with indignation but they still did everything decently and in order one who was dressed in finer vestments than the rest portly person with the fat greasy cheeks and drooping flesh of a celibate church dignitary whom i therefore judged to be the abbot or chief lama of the monastery ave orders to his subordinates in a language which we did not understand his men obeyed him in a second they had closed us round as in a ring or cordon then the chief lama stepped forward with an authoritative air like poohah in the play and said something in the same tongue to the cook who spoke a little tibetan it was obvious from his manner that ram das had told them all about us for the lama selected the cook as interpreter at once without taking any notice of myself the ostensible head of the petty expedition what does he say i asked as soon as he had finished speaking the cook who had been salaaming all the time at the risk of a broken back in his most utterly abject and grovelling attitude made answer tremulously in his broken english this is priestahib of the temple he very angry because why eulopeanahib and memahibs come into tibetand no eulopean no hindu must come into tibetand priestahib say cut all eulopean throats let nepaul man go back like him come to him own country
