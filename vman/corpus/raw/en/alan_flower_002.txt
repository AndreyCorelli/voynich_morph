my right foot flew up and caught sammy in the place at which i had aimed he vanished casting a reproachful look behind him just then a terrible clamour arose in the slavers camp which hitherto had been very silent and just then also the first light of dawn glinted on the barrels of our guns look out i cried as i gulped down the last of my coffee there s something going on there the clamour grew louder and louder till it seemed to fill the skies with a concentrated noise of curses and shrieking distinct from it as it were i heard shouts of alarm and rage and then came the sounds of gunshots yells of agony and the thud of many running feet by now the light was growing fast as it does when once it comes in these latitudes three more minutes and through the grey mist of the dawn we saw dozens of black figures struggling up the slope towards us some seemed to have logs of wood tied behind them others crawled along on all fours others dragged children by the hand and all yelled at the top of their voices the slaves are attacking us said stephen lifting his rifle don t shoot i cried i think they have broken loose and are taking refuge with us i was right these unfortunates had used the two knives which our men smuggled to them to good purpose having cut their bonds during the night they were running to seek the protection of the englishmen and their flag on they surged a hideous mob the slaveticks still fast to the necks of many of them for they had not found time or opportunity to loose them all while behind came the arabs firing the position was clearly very serious for if they burst into our camp we should be overwhelmed by their rush and fall victims to the bullets of their captors hans i cried take the men who were with you last night and try to lead those slaves round behind us quick quick now before we are stamped flat hans darted away and presently i saw him and the two other men running towards the approaching crowd hans waving a shirt or some other white object to attract their attention at the time the foremost of them had halted and were screaming mercy english save us english having caught sight of the muzzles of our guns this was a fortunate occurrence indeed for otherwise hans and his companions could never have stopped them the next thing i saw was the white shirt bearing away to the left on a line which led past the fence of our boma into the scrub and high grass behind the camp after it struggled and scrambled the crowd of slaves like a flock of sheep after the bellether to them hans s shirt was a kind of white helmet of navarre so that danger passed by some of the slaves had been struck by the arab bullets or trodden down in the rush or collapsed from weakness and at those of them who still lived the pursuers were firing one woman who had fallen under the weight of the great slavetick which was fastened about her throat was crawling forward on her hands and knees an arab fired at her and the bullet struck the ground under her stomach but without hurting her for she wriggled forward more quickly i was sure that he would shoot again and watched presently for by now the light was good i saw him a tall fellow in a white robe step from behind the shelter of a bananaree about a hundred and fifty yards away and take a careful aim at the woman but i too took aim and ell i am not bad at this kind of snaphooting when i try that arab s gun never went off only he went up two feet or more into the air and fell backwards shot through the head which was the part of his person that i had covered the hunters uttered a low ow of approval while stephen in a sort of ecstasy exclaimed oh what a heavenly shot not bad but i shouldn t have fired it i answered for they haven t attacked us yet it is a kind of declaration of war and i added as stephen s sunelmet leapt from his head there s the answer down all of you and fire through the loopholes then the fight began except for its grand finale it wasn t really much of a fight when compared with one or two we had afterwards on this expedition but on the other hand its character was extremely awkward for us the arabs made one rush at the beginning shouting on allah as they came but though they were plucky villains they did not repeat that experiment either by good luck or good management stephen knocked over two of them with his doublearrelled rifle and i also emptied my largeore breechoader he first i ever owned mong them not without results while the hunters made a hit or two after this the arabs took cover getting behind trees and as i had feared hiding in the reeds on the banks of the stream thence they harassed us a great deal for amongst them were some very decent shots indeed had we not taken the precaution of lining the thorn fence with a thick bank of earth and sods we should have fared badly as it was one of the hunters was killed the bullet passing through the loophole and striking him in the throat as he was about to fire while the unfortunate bearers who were on rather higher ground suffered a good deal two of them being dispatched outright and four wounded after this i made the rest of them lie flat on the ground close against the fence in such a fashion that we could fire over their bodies soon it became evident that there were more of these arabs than we had thought for quite fifty of them were firing from different places moreover by slow degrees they were advancing with the evident object of outflanking us and gaining the high ground behind some of them of course we stopped as they rushed from cover to cover but this kind of shooting was as difficult as that at bolting rabbits across a woodland ride and to be honest i must say that i alone was much good at the game for here my quick eye and long practice told within an hour the position had grown very serious indeed so much so that we found it necessary to consider what should be done i pointed out that with our small number a charge against the scattered riflemen who were gradually surrounding us would be worse than useless while it was almost hopeless to expect to hold the boma till nightfall once the arabs got behind us they could rake us from the higher ground indeed for the last halfour we had directed all our efforts to preventing them from passing this boma which fortunately the stream on the one side and a stretch of quite open land on the other made it very difficult for them to do without more loss than they cared to face i fear there is only one thing for it i said at length during a pause in the attack while the arabs were either taking counsel or waiting for more ammunition to abandon the camp and everything and bolt up the hill as those fellows must be tired and we are all good runners we may save our lives in that way how about the wounded asked stephen and the slaveoman and child i don t know i answered looking down of course i did know very well but here in an acute form arose the ancient question were we to perish for the sake of certain individuals in whom we had no great interest and whom we could not save by remaining with them if we stayed where we were our end seemed fairly certain whereas if we ran for it we had a good chance of escape but this involved the desertion of several injured bearers and a woman and child whom we had picked up starving all of whom would certainly be massacred save perhaps the woman and child as these reflections flitted through my brain i remembered that a drunken frenchman named leblanc whom i had known in my youth and who had been a friend of napoleon or so he said told me that the great emperor when he was besieging acre in the holy land was forced to retreat being unable to carry off his wounded men he left them in a monastery on mount carmel each with a dose of poison by his side apparently they did not take the poison for according to leblanc who said he was present there not as a wounded ma the turks came and butchered them so napoleon chose to save his own life and that of his army at the expense of his wounded but after all i reflected he was no shining example to christian men and i hadn t time to find any poison in a few words i explained the situation to mavovo leaving out the story of napoleon and asked his advice we must run he answered although i do not like running life is more than stores and he who lives may one day pay his debts but the wounded mavovo we cannot carry them i will see to them macumazana it is the fortune of war or if they prefer it we can leave them o be nursed by the arabs which of course was just napoleon and his poison over again i confess that i was about to assent not wishing that i and stephen especially stephen should be potted in an obscure engagement with some miserable slaveraders when something happened it will be remembered that shortly after dawn hans using a shirt for a flag had led the fugitive slaves past the camp up to the hill behind there he and they had vanished and from that moment to this we had seen nothing of him or them now of a sudden he reappeared still waving the shirt after him rushed a great mob of naked men two hundred of them perhaps brandishing slaveticks stones and the boughs of trees when they had almost reached the boma whence we watched them amazed they split into two bodies half of them passing to our left apparently under the command of the mazitu who had accompanied hans to the slaveamp and the other half to the right following the old hottentot himself i stared at mavovo for i was too thunderstruck to speak ah said mavovo that spotted snake of yours he referred to han is great in his own way for he has even been able to put courage into the hearts of slaves do you not understand my father that they are about to attack those arabs yes and to pull them down as wild dogs do a buffalo calf it was true this was the hottentot s superb design moreover it succeeded up on the hillside he had watched the progress of the fight and seen how it must end then through the interpreter who was with him he harangued those slaves pointing out to them that we their white friends were about to be overwhelmed and that they must either strike for themselves or return to the yoke among them were some who had been warriors in their own tribes and through these he stirred the others they seized the slaveticks from which they had been freed pieces of rock anything that came to their hands and at a given signal charged leaving only the women and children behind them seeing them come the scattered arabs began to fire at them killing some but thereby revealing their own hidinglaces at these the slaves rushed they hurled themselves upon the arabs they tore them they dashed out their brains in such fashion that within another five minutes quite twohirds of them were dead and the rest of whom we took some toll with our rifles as they bolted from cover were in full flight it was a terrible vengeance never did i witness a more savage scene than that of these outraged men wreaking their wrongs upon their tormentors i remember that when most of the arabs had been killed and a few were escaped the slaves found one i think it was the captain of the gang who had hidden himself in a little patch of dead reeds washed up by the stream somehow they managed to fire these i expect that hans who had remained discreetly in the background after the fighting began emerged when it was over and gave them a match in due course out came the wretched arab then they flung themselves on him as marching ants do upon a caterpillar and despite his cries for mercy tore him to fragments literally to fragments being what they were it was hard to blame them if we had seen our parents shot our infants pitilessly butchered our homes destroyed and our women and children marched off in the slaveticks to be sold into bondage should we not have done the same i think so although we are not ignorant savages thus our lives were saved by those whom we had tried to save and for once justice was done even in those dark parts of africa for in that time they were dark indeed had it not been for hans and the courage which he managed to inspire into the hearts of these crushed blacks i have little doubt but that before nightfall we should have been dead for i do not think that any attempt at retreat would have proved successful and if it had what would have happened to us in that wild country surrounded by enemies and with only the few rounds of ammunition that we could have carried in our flight ah baas said the hottentot a little while later squinting at me with his beadike eyes after all you did well to listen to my prayer and bring me with you old hans is a drunkard yes or at least he used to be and old hans gambles yes and perhaps old hans will go to hell but meanwhile old hans can think as he thought one day before the attack on maraisfontein as he thought one day on the hill of slaughter by dingaan s kraal and as he thought this morning up there among the bushes oh he knew how it must end he saw that those dogs of arabs were cutting down a tree to make a bridge across that deep stream and get round to the high ground at the back of you whence they would have shot you all in five minutes and now baas my stomach feels very queer there was no breakfast on the hillside and the sun was very hot i think that just one tot of brandy h i know i promised not to drink but if you give it me the sin is yours not mine well i gave him the tot a stiff one which he drank quite neat although it was against my principles and locked up the bottle afterwards also i shook the old fellow s hand and thanked him which seemed to please him very much for he muttered something to the effect that it was nothing since if i had died he would have died too and therefore he was thinking of himself not of me also two big tears trickled down his snub nose but these may have been produced by the brandy well we were the victors and elated as may be imagined for we knew that the few slavers who had escaped would not attack us again our first thought was for food for it was now past midday and we were starving but dinner presupposed a cook which reminded us of sammy stephen who was in such a state of jubilation that he danced rather than walked the helmet with a bulletole through it stuck ludicrously upon the back of his head started to look for him and presently called to me in an alarmed voice i went to the back of the camp and staring into a hole like a small grave that had been hollowed behind a solitary thorn tree at the bottom of which lay a huddled heap i found him it was sammy to all appearance we got hold of him and up he came limp senseless but still holding in his hand a large thick bible bound in boards moreover in the exact centre of this bible was a bulletole or rather a bullet which had passed through the stout cover and buried itself in the paper behind i remember that the point of it reached to the first book of samuel as for sammy himself he seemed to be quite uninjured and indeed after we had poured some water on him e was never fond of water e revived quickly enough then we found out what had happened gentlemen he said i was seated in my place of refuge being as i have told you a man of peace enjoying the consolation of religion e was very pious in times of trouble at length the firing slackened and i ventured to peep out thinking that perhaps the foe had fled holding the book in front of my face in case of accidents after that i remember no more no said stephen for the bullet hit the bible and the bible hit your head and knocked you silly ah said sammy how true is what i was taught that the book shall be a shield of defence to the righteous now i understand why i was moved to bring the thick old bible that belonged to my mother in heaven and not the little thin one given to me by the sunday school teacher through which the ball of the enemy would have passed then he went off to cook the dinner certainly it was a wonderful escape though whether this was a direct reward of his piety as he thought is another matter as soon as we had eaten we set to work to consider our position of which the crux was what to do with the slaves there they sat in groups outside the fence many of them showing traces of the recent conflict and stared at us stupidly then of a sudden as though with one voice they began to clamour for food how are we to feed several hundred people asked stephen the slavers must have done it somehow i answered let s go and search their camp so we went followed by our hungry clients and in addition to many more things to our delight found a great store of rice mealies and other grain some of which was ground into meal of this we served out an ample supply together with salt and soon the cooking pots were full of porridge my word how those poor creatures did eat nor although it was necessary to be careful could we find it in our hearts to stint them of the first full meal that had passed their lips after weeks of starvation when at length they were satisfied we addressed them thanking them for their bravery telling them that they were free and asking what they meant to do upon this point they seemed to have but one idea they said that they would come with us who were their protectors then followed a great indaba or consultation which really i have not time to set out the end of it was that we agreed that so many of them as wished should accompany us till they reached country that they knew when they would be at liberty to depart to their own homes meanwhile we divided up the blankets and other stores of the arabs such as trade goods and beads among them and then left them to their own devices after placing a guard over the foodstuffs for my part i hoped devoutly that in the morning we should find them gone after this we returned to our boma just in time to assist at a sad ceremony that of the burial of my hunter who had been shot through the head his companions had dug a deep hole outside the fence and within a few yards of where he fell in this they placed him in a sitting position with his face turned towards zululand setting by his side two gourds that belonged to him one filled with water and the other with grain also they gave him a blanket and his two assegais tearing the blanket and breaking the handles of the spears to kill them as they said then quietly enough they threw in the earth about him and filled the top of the hole with large stones to prevent the hyenas from digging him up this done one by one they walked past the grave each man stopping to bid him farewell by name mavovo who came last made a little speech telling the deceased to namba kachle that is go comfortably to the land of ghosts as he added no doubt he would do who had died as a man should he requested him moreover if he returned as a spirit to bring good and not illortune on us since otherwise when he mavovo became a spirit in his turn he would have words to say to him on the matter in conclusion he remarked that as his mavovo s snake had foretold this event at durban a fact with which the deceased would now be acquainted he the said deceased could never complain of not having received value for the shilling he had paid as a divining fee yes exclaimed one of the hunters with a note of anxiety in his voice but your snake mentioned six of us to you o doctor it did replied mavovo drawing a pinch of snuff up his uninjured nostril and our brother there was the first of the six be not afraid the other five will certainly join him in due course for my snake must speak the truth still if anyone is in a hurry and he glared round the little circle let him stop and talk with me alone perhaps i could arrange that his turn here he stopped for they were all gone glad i didn t pay a shilling to have my fortune told by mavovo said stephen when we were back in the boma but why did they bury his pots and spears with him to be used by the spirit on its journey i answered although they do not quite know it these zulus believe like all the rest of the world that man lives on elsewhere chapter the magic mirror i did not sleep very well that night for now that the danger was over i found that the long strain of it had told upon my nerves also there were many noises thus the bearers who were shot had been handed over to their companions who disposed of them in a simple fashion namely by throwing them into the bush where they attracted the notice of hyenas then the four wounded men who lay near to me groaned a good deal or when they were not groaning uttered loud prayers to their local gods we had done the best we could for these unlucky fellows indeed that kindearted little coward sammy who at some time in his career served as a dresser in a hospital had tended their wounds none of which were mortal very well indeed and from time to time rose to minister to them but what disturbed me most was the fearful hubbub which came from the camp below many of the tropical african tribes are really semiocturnal in their habits i suppose because there the night is cooler than the day and on any great occasion this tendency asserts itself thus every one of these freed slaves seemed to be howling his loudest to an accompaniment of clashing iron pots or stones which lacking their native drums they beat with sticks moreover they had lit large fires about which they flitted in an ominous and unpleasant fashion that reminded me of some mediaeval pictures of hell which i had seen in an old book at last i could stand it no longer and kicking hans who curled up like a dog slept at my feet asked him what was going on his answer caused me to regret the question plenty of those slaves cannibal men baas think they eat the arabs and like them very much he said with a yawn then went to sleep again i did not continue the conversation when at length we made a start on the following morning the sun was high over us indeed there was a great deal to do the guns and ammunition of the dead arabs had to be collected the ivory of which they carried a good store must be buried for to take it with us was impossible and the loads apportioned also it was necessary to make litters for the wounded and to stir up the slaves from their debauch into the nature of which i made no further inquiries was no easy task on mustering them i found that a good number had vanished during the night where to i do not know still a mob of well over two hundred people a considerable portion of whom were women and children remained whose one idea seemed to be to accompany us wherever we might wander so with this miscellaneous following at length we started to my sorrow we never saw this ivory again q to describe our adventures during the next month would be too long if not impossible for to tell the truth after the lapse of so many years these have become somewhat entangled in my mind our great difficulty was to feed such a multitude for the store of rice and grain upon which we were quite unable to keep a strict supervision they soon devoured fortunately the country through which we passed at this time of the year the end of the wet seaso was full of game of which travelling as we did very slowly we were able to shoot a great deal but this game killing delightful as it may be to the sportsman soon palled on us as a business to say nothing of the expenditure of ammunition it meant incessant work against this the zulu hunters soon began to murmur for as stephen and i could rarely leave the camp the burden of it fell on them ultimately i hit upon this scheme picking out thirty or forty of the likeliest men among the slaves i served out to each of them ammunition and one of the arab guns in the use of which we drilled them as best we could then i told them that they must provide themselves and their companions with meat of course accidents happened one man was accidentally shot and three others were killed by a cow elephant and a wounded buffalo but in the end they learned to handle their rifles sufficiently well to supply the camp moreover day by day little parties of the slaves disappeared i presume to seek their own homes so that when at last we entered the borders of the mazitu country there were not more than fifty of them left including seventeen of those whom we had taught to shoot then it was that our real adventures began one evening after three days march through some difficult bush in which lions carried off a slave woman killed one of the donkeys and mauled another so badly that it had to be shot we found ourselves upon the edge of a great grassy plateau that according to my aneroid was feet above sea level what place is this i asked of the two mazitu guides those same men whom we had borrowed from hassan the land of our people chief they answered which is bordered on one side by the bush and on the other by the great lake where live the pongo wizards i looked about me at the bare uplands that already were beginning to turn brown on which nothing was visible save vast herds of buck such as were common further south a dreary prospect it was for a slight rain was falling accompanied by mist and a cold wind i do not see your people or their kraals i said i only see grass and wild game our people will come they replied rather nervously no doubt even now their spies watch us from among the tall grass or out of some hole the deuce they do i said or something like it and thought no more of the matter when one is in conditions in which anything may happen such as so far as i am concerned have prevailed through most of my life one grows a little careless as to what will happen for my part i have long been a fatalist to a certain extent i mean i believe that the individual or rather the identity which animates him came out from the source of all life a long while perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago and when his career is finished perhaps hundreds of thousands or millions of years hence or perhaps toorrow will return perfected but still as an individual to dwell in or with that source of life i believe also that his various existences here or elsewhere are forenown and forerdained although in a sense he may shape them by the action of his free will and that nothing which he can do will lengthen or shorten one of them by a single hour therefore so far as i am concerned i have always acted up to the great injunction of our master and taken no thought for the morrow however in this instance as in many others of my experience the morrow took plenty of thought for itself indeed before the dawn hans who never seemed really to sleep any more than a dog does woke me up with the ominous information that he heard a sound which he thought was caused by the tramp of hundreds of marching men where i asked after listening without avail o look was useless for the night was dark as pitch he put his ear to the ground and said there i put my ear to the ground but although my senses are fairly acute could hear nothing then i sent for the sentries but these too could hear nothing after this i gave the business up and went to sleep again however as it proved hans was quite right in such matters he generally was right for his senses were as keen as those of any wild beast at dawn i was once more awakened this time by mavovo who reported that we were being surrounded by a regiment or regiments i rose and looked out through the mist there sure enough in dim and solemn outline though still far off i perceived rank upon rank of men armed men for the light glimmered faintly upon their spears what is to be done macumazana asked mavovo have breakfast i think i answered if we are going to be killed it may as well be after breakfast as before and calling the trembling sammy i instructed him to make the coffee also i awoke stephen and explained the situation to him capital he answered no doubt these are the mazitu and we have found them much more easily than we expected people generally take such a lot of hunting for in this confounded great country that s not such a bad way of looking at things i answered but would you be good enough to go round the camp and make it clear that not on any account is anyone to fire without orders stay collect all the guns from those slaves for heaven knows what they will do with them if they are frightened stephen nodded and sauntered off with three or four of the hunters while he was gone in consultation with mavovo i made certain little arrangements of my own which need not be detailed they were designed to enable us to sell our lives as dearly as possible should things come to the worst one should always try to make an impression upon the enemy in africa for the sake of future travellers if for no other reason in due course stephen and the hunters returned with the guns or most of them and reported that the slave people were in great state of terror and showed a disposition to bolt let them bolt i answered they would be of no use to us in a row and might even complicate matters call in the zulus who are watching at once he nodded and a few minutes later i heard or the mist which hung about the bush to the east of the camp was still too dense to allow of my seeing anything clamour of voices followed by the sound of scuttling feet the slave people including our bearers had gone every one of them they even carried away the wounded just as the soldiers who surrounded us were completing their circle they bolted between the two ends of it and vanished into the bush out of which we had marched on the previous evening often since then i have wondered what became of them doubtless some perished and the rest worked their way back to their homes or found new ones among other tribes the experiences of those who escaped must be interesting to them if they still live i can well imagine the legends in which these will be embodied two or three generations hence deducting the slave people and the bearers whom we had wrung out of hassan we were now a party of seventeen namely eleven zulu hunters including mavovo two white men hans and sammy and the two mazitus who had elected to remain with us while round us was a great circle of savages which closed in slowly as the light grew t was long in coming on that dull morning nd the mist lifted i examined these people without seeming to take any particular notice of them they were tall much taller than the average zulu and slighter in their build also lighter in colour like the zulus they carried large hide shields and one very broadladed spear throwing assegais seemed to be wanting but in place of them i saw that they were armed with short bows which together with a quiver of arrows were slung upon their backs the officers wore a short skin cloak or kaross and the men also had cloaks which i found out afterwards were made from the inner bark of trees they advanced in the most perfect silence and very slowly nobody said anything and if orders were given this must have been done by signs i could not see that any of them had firearms now i said to stephen perhaps if we shot and killed some of those fellows they might be frightened and run away or they might not or if they did they might return whatever happened he remarked sagely we should scarcely be welcome in their country afterwards so i think we had better do nothing unless we are obliged i nodded for it was obvious that we could not fight hundreds of men and told sammy who was perfectly livid with fear to bring the breakfast no wonder he was afraid poor fellow for we were in great danger these mazitu had a bad name and if they chose to attack us we should all be dead in a few minutes the coffee and some cold buck s flesh were put upon our little campable in front of the tent which we had pitched because of the rain and we began to eat the zulu hunters also ate from a bowl of mealie porridge which they had cooked on the previous night each of them with his loaded rifle upon his knees our proceedings appeared to puzzle the mazitu very much indeed they drew quite near to us to within about forty yards and halted there in a dead circle staring at us with their great round eyes it was like a scene in a dream i shall never forget it everything about us appeared to astonish them our indifference the colour of stephen and myself as a matter of fact at that date brother john was the only white man they had ever see our tent and our two remaining donkeys indeed when one of these beasts broke into a bray they showed signs of fright looking at each other and even retreating a few paces at length the position got upon my nerves especially as i saw that some of them were beginning to fiddle with their bows and that their general a tall oneyed old fellow was making up his mind to do something i called to one of the two mazitus whom i forgot to say we had named tom and jerry and gave him a pannikin of coffee take that to the captain there with my good wishes jerry and ask him if he will drink with us i said jerry who was a plucky fellow obeyed advancing with the steaming coffee he held it under the captain s nose evidently he knew the man s name for i heard him say o babemba the white lords macumazana and wazela ask if you will share their holy drink with them i could perfectly understand the words for these people spoke a dialect so akin to zulu that by now it had no difficulty for me their holy drink exclaimed the old fellow starting back man it is hot redater would these white wizards poison me with mwavi here i should explain that mwavi or mkasa as it is sometimes called is the liquor distilled from the inner bark of a sort of mimosa tree or sometimes from a root of the strychnos tribe which is administered by the witchoctors to persons accused of crime if it makes them sick they are declared innocent if they are thrown into convulsions or stupor they are clearly guilty and die either from the effects of the poison or afterwards by other means this is no mwavi o babemba said jerry it is the divine liquor that makes the white lords shoot straight with their wonderful guns which kill at a thousand paces see i will swallow some of it and he did though it must have burnt his tongue thus encouraged old babemba sniffed at the coffee and found it fragrant then he called a man who from his peculiar dress i took to be a doctor made him drink some and watched the results which were that the doctor tried to finish the pannikin snatching it away indignantly babemba drank himself and as i had halfilled the cup with sugar found the mixture good it is indeed a holy drink he said smacking his lips have you any more of it the white lords have more said jerry they invite you to eat with them babemba stuck his finger into the tin and covering it with the sediment of sugar sucked and reflected it s all right i whispered to stephen i don t think he kill us after drinking our coffee and what s more i believe he is coming to breakfast this may be a snare said babemba who now began to lick the sugar out of the pannikin no answered jerry with creditable resource though they could easily kill you all the white lords do not hurt those who have partaken of their holy drink that is unless anyone tries to harm them cannot you bring some more of the holy drink here he asked giving a final polish to the pannikin with his tongue no said jerry if you want it you must go there fear nothing would i one of your own people betray you true exclaimed babemba by your talk and your face you are a mazitu how came you ell we will speak of that afterwards i am very thirsty i will come soldiers sit down and watch and if any harm happens to me avenge it and report to the king now while all this was going on i had made hans and sammy open one of the boxes and extract therefrom a goodized mirror in a wooden frame with a support at the back so that it could be stood anywhere fortunately it was unbroken indeed our packing had been so careful that none of the lookinglasses or other fragile things were injured to this mirror i gave a hasty polish then set it upright upon the table old babemba came along rather suspiciously his one eye rolling over us and everything that belonged to us when he was quite close it fell upon the mirror he stopped he stared he retreated then drawn by his overmastering curiosity came on again and again stood still what is the matter called his second in command from the ranks the matter is he answered that here is great magic here i see myself walking towards myself there can be no mistake for one eye is gone in my other self advance o babemba cried the doctor who had tried to drink all the coffee and see what happens keep your spear ready and if your witchelf attempts to harm you kill it thus encouraged babemba lifted his spear and dropped it again in a great hurry that won t do fool of a doctor he shouted back my other self lifts a spear also and what is more all of you who should be behind are in front of me the holy drink has made me drunk i am bewitched save me now i saw that the joke had gone too far for the soldiers were beginning to string their bows in confusion luckily at this moment the sun at length came out almost opposite to us o babemba i said in a solemn voice it is true that this magic shield which we have brought as a gift to you gives you another self henceforth your labours will be halved and your pleasures doubled for when you look into this shield you will be not one but two also it has other properties and lifting the mirror i used it as a heliograph flashing the reflected sunlight into the eyes of the long halfircle of men in front of us my word didn t they run wonderful exclaimed old babemba and can i learn to do that also white lord certainly i answered come and try now hold it so while i say the spell and i muttered some hocusocus then directed it towards certain of the mazitu who were gathering again there look look you have hit them in the eye you are a master of magic they run they run and run they did indeed is there anyone yonder whom you dislike yes plenty answered babemba with emphasis especially that witchoctor who drank nearly all the holy drink very well byndy i will show you how you can burn a hole in him with this magic no not now not now for a while this mocker of the sun is dead look and dipping the glass beneath the table i produced it back first you cannot see anything can you nothing except wood replied babemba staring at the deal slip with which it was lined then i threw a dishloth over it and to change the subject offered him another pannikin of the holy drink and a stool to sit on the old fellow perched himself very gingerly upon the stool which was of the folding variety stuck the ironipped end of his great spear in the ground between his knees and took hold of the pannikin or rather he took hold of a pannikin and not the right one so ridiculous was his appearance that the lightinded stephen who forgetting the perils of the situation had for the last minute or two been struggling with inward laughter clapped down his coffee on the table and retired into the tent where i heard him gurgling in unseemly merriment it was this coffee that in the confusion of the moment sammy gave to old babemba presently stephen reappeared and to cover his confusion seized the pannikin meant for babemba and drank it or most of it then sammy seeing his mistake said mr somers i regret that there is an error you are drinking from the cup which that stinking savage has just licked clean the effect was dreadful and instantaneous for then and there stephen was violently sick why does the white lord do that asked babemba now i see that you are truly deceiving me and that what you are giving me to swallow is nothing but hot mwavi which in the innocent causes vomiting but that in those who mean evil death stop that foolery you idiot i muttered to stephen kicking him on the shins or you get our throats cut then collecting myself with an effort i said oh not at all general this white lord is the priest of the holy drink and hat you see is a religious rite is it so said babemba then i hope that the rite is not catching never i replied proffering him a biscuit and now general babemba tell me why do you come against us with about five hundred armed men to kill you white lords h how hot is this holy drink yet pleasant you said that it was not catching did you not for i feel eat the cake i answered and why do you wish to kill us be so good as to tell me the truth now or i shall read it in the magic shield which portrays the inside as well as the out and lifting the cloth i stared at the glass if you can read my thoughts white lord why trouble me to tell them asked babemba sensibly enough his mouth full of biscuit still as that bright thing may lie i will set them out bausi king of our people has sent me to kill you because news has reached him that you are great slave dealers who come hither with guns to capture the mazitus and take them away to the black water to be sold and sent across it in big canoes that move of themselves of this he has been warned by messengers from the arab men moreover we know that it is true for last night you had with you many slaves who seeing our spears ran away not an hour ago now i stared hard at the lookinglass and answered coolly this magic shield tells a somewhat different story it says that your king bausi for whom by the way we have many things as presents told you to lead us to him with honour that we might talk over matters with him the shot was a good one babemba grew confused it is true he stammered that mean the king left it to my judgment i will consult the witchoctor if he left it to your judgment the matter is settled i said since certainly being so great a noble you would never try to murder those of whose holy drink you have just partaken indeed if you did so i added in a cold voice you would not live long yourself one secret word and that drink will turn to mwavi of the worst sort inside of you oh yes white lord it is settled exclaimed babemba it is settled do not trouble the secret word i will lead you to the king and you shall talk with him by my head and my father s spirit you are safe from me still with your leave i will call the great doctor imbozwi and ratify the agreement in his presence and also show him the magic shield so imbozwi was sent for jerry taking the message presently he arrived he was a villainousooking person of uncertain age humpbacked like the picture of punch wizened and squintyed his costume was of the ordinary witchoctor type being set off with snake skins fish bladders baboon s teeth and little bags of medicine to add to his charms a broad strip of pigment red ochre probably ran down his forehead and the nose beneath across the lips and chin ending in a red mark the size of a penny where the throat joins the chest his woolly hair also in which was twisted a small ring of black gum was soaked with grease and powdered blue it was arranged in a kind of horn coming to a sharp point about five inches above the top of the skull altogether he looked extremely like the devil what was more he was a devil in a bad temper for the first words he said embodied a reproach to us for not having asked him to partake of our holy drink with babemba we offered to make him some more but he refused saying that we should poison him then babemba set the matter out rather nervously i thought for evidently he was afraid of this old wizard who listened in complete silence when babemba explained that without the king s direct order it would be foolish and unjustifiable to put to death such magicians as we were imbozwi spoke for the first time asking why he called us magicians babemba instanced the wonders of the shining shield that showed pictures pooh said imbozwi does not calm water or polished iron show pictures but this shield will make fire said babemba the white lords say it can burn a man up then let it burn me up replied imbozwi with ineffable contempt and i will believe that these white men are magicians worthy to be kept alive and not common slaveraders such as we have often heard of burn him white lords and show him that i am right exclaimed the exasperated babemba after which they fell to wrangling evidently they were rivals and by this time both of them had lost their tempers the sun was now very hot quite sufficiently so to enable us to give mr imbozwi a taste of our magic which i determined he should have not being certain whether an ordinary mirror would really reflect enough heat to scorch i drew from my pocket a very powerful burninglass which i sometimes used for the lighting of fires in order to save matches and holding the mirror in one hand and the burninglass in the other i worked myself into a suitable position for the experiment babemba and the witchoctor were arguing so fiercely that neither of them seemed to notice what i was doing getting the focus right i directed the concentrated spark straight on to imbozwi s greased topnot where i knew he would feel nothing my plan being to char a hole in it but as it happened this topnot was built up round something of a highly inflammable nature reed or camphorood i expect at any rate about thirty seconds later the topnot was burning like a beautiful torch ow said the kaffirs who were watching my aunt exclaimed stephen look look shouted babemba in tones of delight now will you believe o blownut bladder of a man that there are greater magicians than yourself in the world what is the matter son of a dog that you make a mock of me screeched the unfuriated imbozwi who alone was unaware of anything unusual as he spoke some suspicion rose in his mind which caused him to put his hand to his topnot and withdraw it with a howl then he sprang up and began to dance about which of course only fanned the fire that had now got hold of the grease and gum the zulus applauded babemba clapped his hands stephen burst into one of his idiotic fits of laughter for my part i grew frightened near at hand stood a large wooden pot such as the kaffirs make from which the coffee kettle had been filled that fortunately was still halfull of water i seized it and ran to him save me white lord he howled you are the greatest of magicians and i am your slave here i cut him short by clapping the pot bottom upwards on his burning head into which it vanished as a candle does into an extinguisher smoke and a bad smell issued from beneath the pot the water from which ran all over imbozwi who stood quite still when i was sure the fire was out i lifted the pot and revealed the discomfited wizard but without his elaborate headress beyond a little scorching he was not in the least hurt for i had acted in time only he was bald for when touched the charred hair fell off at the roots it is gone he said in an amazed voice after feeling at his scalp yes i answered quite the magic shield worked very well did it not can you put it back again white lord he asked that will depend upon how you behave i replied then without another word he turned and walked back to the soldiers who received him with shouts of laughter evidently imbozwi was not a popular character and his discomfiture delighted them babemba also was delighted indeed he could not praise our magic enough and at once began to make arrangements to escort us to the king at his head town which was called beza vowing that we need fear no harm at his hands or those of his soldiers in fact the only person who did not appreciate our black arts was imbozwi himself i caught a look in his eye as he marched off which told me that he hated us bitterly and reflected to myself that perhaps i had been foolish to use that burninglass although in truth i had not intended to set his head on fire my father said mavovo to me afterwards it would have been better to let that snake burn to death for then you would have killed his poison i am something of a doctor myself and i tell you there is nothing our brotherhood hates so much as being laughed at you have made a fool of him before all his people and he will not forget it macumazana chapter bausi the king about midday we made a start for beza town where king bausi lived which we understood we ought to reach on the following evening for some hours the regiment marched in front or rather round us but as we complained to babemba of the noise and dust with a confidence that was quite touching he sent it on ahead first however he asked us to pass our word by our mothers which was the most sacred of oaths among many african peoples that we would not attempt to escape i confess that i hesitated before giving an answer not being entirely enamoured of the mazitu and of our prospects among them especially as i had discovered through jerry that the discomfited imbozwi had departed from the soldiers on some business of his own had the matter been left to me indeed i should have tried to slip back into the bush over the border and there put in a few months shooting during the dry season while working my way southwards this too was the wish of the zulu hunters of hans and i need not add of sammy but when i mentioned the matter to stephen he implored me to abandon the idea look here quatermain he said i have come to this godorsaken country to get that great cypripedium and get it i will or die in the attempt still he added after surveying our rather blank faces i have no right to play with your lives so if you think the thing too dangerous i will go on alone with this old boy babemba putting everything else aside i think that one of us ought to visit bausi s kraal in case the gentleman who you call brother john should turn up there in short i have made up my mind so it is no use talking i lit my pipe and for quite a time contemplated this obstinate young man while considering the matter from every point of view finally i came to the conclusion that he was right and i was wrong it was true that by bribing babemba or otherwise there was still an excellent prospect of effecting a masterly retreat and of avoiding many perils on the other hand we had not come to this wild place in order to retreat further at whose expense had we come here at that of stephen somers who wished to proceed lastly to say nothing of the chance of meeting brother john to whom i felt no obligation since he had given us the slip at durban i did not like the idea of being beaten we had started out to visit some mysterious savages who worshipped a monkey and a flower and we might as well go on till circumstances were too much for us after all dangers are everywhere those who turn back because of dangers will never succeed in any life that we can imagine mavovo i said presently pointing to stephen with my pipe the inkoosi wazela does not wish to try to escape he wishes to go on to the country of the pongo people if we can get there and mavovo remember that he has paid for everything we are his hired servants also that he says that if we run back he will walk forward alone with these mazitus still if any of you hunters desire to slip off he will not look your way nor shall i what say you i say macumazana that though young wazela is a chief with a great heart and that where you and he go i shall go also as i think will the rest of us i do not like these mazitu for if their fathers were zulus their mothers were low people they are bastards and of the pongo i hear nothing but what is evil still no good ox ever turns in the yoke because of a mudole let us go on for if we sink in the swamp what does it matter moreover my snake tells me that we shall not sink at least not all of us so it was arranged that no effort should be made to return sammy it is true wished to do so but when it came to the point and he was offered one of the remaining donkeys and as much food and ammunition as he could carry he changed his mind i think it better mr quatermain he said to meet my end in the company of highorn lofty souls than to pursue a lonely career towards the inevitable in unknown circumstances very well put sammy i answered so while waiting for the inevitable please go and cook the dinner having laid aside our doubts we proceeded on the journey comfortably enough being well provided with bearers to take the place of those who had run away babemba accompanied by a single orderly travelled with us and from him we collected much information it seemed that the mazitu were a large people who could muster from five to seven thousand spears their tradition was that they came from the south and were of the same stock as the zulus of whom they had heard vaguely indeed many of their customs to say nothing of their language resembled those of that country their military organisation however was not so thorough and in other ways they struck me as a lower race in one particular it is true that of their houses they were more advanced for these as we saw in the many kraals that we passed were better built with doorways through which one could walk upright instead of the kaffir beeoles we slept in one of these houses on our march and should have found it very comfortable had it not been for the innumerable fleas which at length drove us out into the courtyard for the rest these mazitu much resembled the zulus they had kraals and were breeders of cattle they were ruled by headmen under the command of a supreme chief or king they believed in witchcraft and offered sacrifice to the spirits of their ancestors also in some kind of a vague and mighty god who dominated the affairs of the world and declared his will through the doctors lastly they were and i dare say still are a race of fighting men who loved war and raided the neighbouring peoples upon any and every pretext killing their men and stealing their women and cattle they had their virtues too being kindly and hospitable by nature though cruel enough to their enemies moreover they detested dealing in slaves and those who practised it saying that it was better to kill a man than to deprive him of his freedom also they had a horror of the cannibalism which is so common in the dark regions of africa and for this reason more than any other loathed the pongo folk who were supposed to be eaters of men on the evening of the second day of our march during which we had passed through a beautiful and fertile upland country very well watered and except in the valleys free from bush we arrived at beza this town was situated on a wide plain surrounded by low hills and encircled by a belt of cultivated land made beautiful by the crops of maize and other cereals which were then ripe to harvest it was fortified in a way that is a tall unclimbable palisade of timber surrounded the entire town which fence was strengthened by prickly pears and cacti planted on its either side within this palisade the town was divided into quarters more or less devoted to various trades thus one part of it was called the ironsmiths quarter another the soldiers quarter another the quarter of the landillers another that of the skinressers and so on the king s dwelling and those of his women and dependents were near the north gate and in front of these surrounded by semiircles of huts was a wide space into which cattle could be driven if necessary this however at the time of our visit was used as a market and a drilling ground we entered the town that must in all have contained a great number of inhabitants by the south gate a strong log structure facing a wooded slope through which ran a road just as the sun was setting we marched to the guestuts up a central street lined with the population of the place who had gathered to stare at us these huts were situated in the soldiers quarter not far from the king s house and surrounded by an inner fence to keep them private none of the people spoke as we passed them for the mazitu are polite by nature also it seemed to me that they regarded us with awe tempered by curiosity they only stared and occasionally those of them who were soldiers saluted us by lifting their spears the huts into which we were introduced by babemba with whom we had grown very friendly were good and clean here all our belongings including the guns which we had collected just before the slaves ran away were placed in one of the huts over which a mazitu mounted guard the donkeys being tied to the fence at a little distance outside this fence stood another armed mazitu also on guard are we prisoners here i asked of babemba the king watches over his guests he answered enigmatically have the white lords any message for the king whom i am summoned to see this night yes i answered tell the king that we are the brethren of him who more than a year ago cut a swelling from his body whom we have arranged to meet here i mean the white lord with a long beard who among you black people is called dogeetah babemba started you are the brethren of dogeetah how comes it then that you never mentioned his name before and when is he going to meet you here know that dogeetah is a great man among us for with him alone of all men the king has made bloodrotherhood as the king is so is dogeetah among the mazitu we never mentioned him because we do not talk about everything at once babemba as to when dogeetah will meet us i am not sure i am only sure that he is coming yes lord macumazana but when when that is what the king will want to know and that is what you must tell him lord he added dropping his voice you are in danger here where you have many enemies since it is not lawful for white men to enter this land if you would save your lives be advised by me and be ready to tell the king toorrow when dogeetah whom he loves will appear here to vouch for you and see that he does appear very soon and by the day you name since otherwise when he comes if come he does he may not find you able to talk to him now i your friend have spoken and the rest is with you then without another word he rose slipped through the door of the hut and out by the gateway of the fence from which the sentry moved aside to let him pass i too rose from the stool on which i sat and danced about the hut in a perfect fury do you understand what that infernal i am afraid i used a stronger wor old fool told me i exclaimed to stephen he says that we must be prepared to state exactly when that other infernal old fool brother john will turn up at beza town and that if we don t we shall have our throats cut as indeed has already been arranged rather awkward replied stephen there are no express trains to beza and if there were we couldn t be sure that brother john would take one of them i suppose there is a brother john he added reflectively to me he seems to be ntimately connected with mrs harris oh there is or there was i explained why couldn t the confounded ass wait quietly for us at durban instead of fooling off butterfly hunting to the north of zululand and breaking his leg or his neck there if he has done anything of the sort don t know i am sure it s hard enough to understand one s own motives let alone brother john s then we sat down on our stools again and stared at each other at this moment hans crept into the hut and squatted down in front of us he might have walked in as there was a doorway but he preferred to creep on his hands and knees i don t know why what is it you ugly little toad i asked viciously for that was just what he looked like even the skin under his jaw moved like a toad s the baas is in trouble remarked hans i should think he was i answered and so will you be presently when you are wriggling on the point of a mazitu spear they are broad spears that would make a big hole remarked hans again whereupon i rose to kick him out for his ideas were as usual unpleasant baas he went on i have been listening here is a very good hole in this hut for listening if one lies against the wall and pretends to be asleep i have heard all and understood most of your talk with that oneyed savage and the baas stephen well you little sneak what of it only baas that if we do not want to be killed in this place from which there is no escape it is necessary that you should find out exactly on what day and at what hour dogeetah is going to arrive look here you yellow idiot i exclaimed if you are beginning that game too i then i stopped reflecting that my temper was getting the better of me and that i had better hear what hans had to say before i vented it on him baas mavovo is a great doctor it is said that his snake is the straightest and the strongest in all zululand save that of his master zikali the old slave he told you that dogeetah was laid up somewhere with a hurt leg and that he was coming to meet you here no doubt therefore he can tell you also when he is coming i would ask him but he won t set his snake to work for me so you must ask him baas and perhaps he will forget that you laughed at his magic and that he swore you would never see it again oh blind one i answered how do i know that mavovo s story about dogeetah was not all nonsense hans stared at me amazed mavovo s story nonsense mavovo s snake a liar oh baas that is what comes of being too much a christian now thanks to your father the predikant i am a christian too but not so much that i have forgotten how to know good magic from bad mavovo s snake a liar and after he whom we buried yonder was the first of the hunters whom the feathers named to him at durban and he began to chuckle in intense amusement then added well baas there it is you must either ask mavovo and very nicely or we shall all be killed i don t mind much for i should rather like to begin again a little younger somewhere else but just think what a noise sammy will make and turning he crept out as he had crept in here s a nice position i groaned to stephen when he had gone i a white man who in spite of some coincidences with which i am acquainted know that all this kaffir magic is bosh am to beg a savage to tell me something of which he must be ignorant that is unless we educated people have got hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether it is humiliating it isn t christian and i hanged if i do it i dare say you will be anged i mean hether you do it or whether you don t replied stephen with his sweet smile but i say old fellow how do you know it is all bosh we are told about lots of miracles which weren t bosh and if miracles ever existed why can t they exist now but there i know what you mean and it is no use arguing still if you re proud i ain t i try to soften the stony heart of mavovo e are rather pals you know nd get him to unroll the book of his occult wisdom and he went a few minutes later i was called out to receive a sheep which with milk native beer some corn and other things including green forage for the donkeys bausi had sent for us to eat here i may remark that while we were among the mazitu we lived like fighting cocks there was none of that starvation which is or was so common in east africa where the traveller often cannot get food for love or money enerally because there is none when this business was settled by my sending a message of thanks to the king with an intimation that we hoped to wait upon him on the morrow with a few presents i went to seek sammy in order to tell him to kill and cook the sheep after some search i found or rather heard him beyond a reed fence which divided two of the huts he was acting as interpreter between stephen somers and mavovo this zulu man declares mr somers he said that he quite understands everything you have been explaining and that it is probable that we shall all be butchered by this savage bausi if we cannot tell him when the white man dogeetah whom he loves will arrive here he says also that he thinks that by his magic he could learn when this will happen f it is to happen at all which of course mr somers for your private information only is a mighty lie of the ignorant heathe he adds however that he does not care one brass farthing is actual expression mr somers is one grain of corn on a mealieob bout his or anybody else s life which from all i have heard of his proceedings i can well believe to be true he says in his vulgar language that there is no difference between the belly of a mazituand hyena and that of any other hyena and that the earth of mazituand is as welcome to his bones as any other earth since the earth is the wickedest of all hyenas in that he has observed that soon or late it devours everlastingly everything which once it bore you must forgive me for reproducing his empty and childish talk mr somers but you bade me to render the words of this savage with exactitude in fact mr somers this reckless person intimates in short that some power with which he is not acquainted e calls it the strength that makes the sun to shine and broiders the blanket of the night with stars forgive me for repeating his silly word caused him to be born into this world and at an hour already appointed will draw him from this world back into its dark eternal bosom there to be rocked in sleep or nursed to life again according to its unknown will translate exactly mr somers although i do not know what it all means nd that he does not care a curse when this happens still he says that whereas he is growing old and has known many sorrows e alludes here i gather to some nigger wives of his whom another savage knocked on the head also to a child to whom he appears to have been attached ou are young with all your days and he hopes joys before you therefore he would gladly do anything in his power to save your life because although you are white and he is black he has conceived an affection for you and looks on you as his child yes mr somers although i blush to repeat it this black fellow says he looks upon you as his child he adds indeed that if the opportunity arises he will gladly give his life to save your life and that it cuts his heart in two to refuse you anything still he must refuse this request of yours that he will ask the creature he calls his snake hat he means by that i don t know mr somers o declare when the white man named dogeetah will arrive in this place for this reason that he told mr quatermain when he laughed at him about his divinations that he would make no more magic for him or any of you and that he will die rather than break his word that s all mr somers and i dare say you will think uite enough too i understand replied stephen tell the chief mavovo i observed he laid an emphasis on the word chief that i quite understand and that i thank him very much for explaining things to me so fully then ask him whether as the matter is so important there is no way out of this trouble sammy translated into zulu which he spoke perfectly as i noted without interpolations or additions only one way answered mavovo in the intervals of taking snuff it is that macumazana himself shall ask me to do this thing macumazana is my old chief and friend and for his sake i will forget what in the case of others i should always remember if he will come and ask me without mockery to exercise my skill on behalf of all of us i will try to exercise it although i know very well that he believes it to be but as an idle little whirlwind that stirs the dust that raises the dust and lets it fall again without purpose or meaning forgetting as the wise white men forget that even the wind which blows the dust is the same that breathes in our nostrils and that to it we also are as is the dust now i the listener thought for a moment or two the words of this fighting savage mavovo even those of them of which i had heard only the translation garbled and beslavered by the mean comments of the unutterable sammy stirred my imagination who was i that i should dare to judge of him and his wild unknown gifts who was i that i should mock at him and by my mockery intimate that i believed him to be a fraud stepping through the gateway of the fence i confronted him mavovo i said i have overheard your talk i am sorry if i laughed at you in durban i do not understand what you call your magic it is beyond me and may be true or may be false still i shall be grateful to you if you will use your power to discover if you can whether dogeetah is coming here and if so when now do as it may please you i have spoken and i have heard macumazana my father toight i will call upon my snake whether it will answer or what it will answer i cannot say well he did call upon his snake with due and portentous ceremony and according to stephen who was present which i declined to be that mystic reptile declared that dogeetah alias brother john would arrive in beza town precisely at sunset on the third day from that night now as he had divined on friday according to our almanac this meant that we might hope to see him ope exactly described my state of mind on the matter n the monday evening in time for supper all right i said briefly please do not talk to me any more about this impious rubbish for i want to go to sleep next morning early we unpacked our boxes and made a handsome selection of gifts for the king bausi hoping thus to soften his royal heart it included a bale of calico several knives a musical box a cheap american revolver and a bundle of toothicks also several pounds of the best and most fashionable beads for his wives this truly noble present we sent to the king by our two mazitu servants tom and jerry who were marched off in the charge of several sentries for i hoped that these men would talk to their compatriots and tell them what good fellows we were indeed i instructed them to do so imagine our horror therefore when about an hour later just as we were tidying ourselves up after breakfast there appeared through the gate not tom and jerry for they had vanished but a long line of mazitu soldiers each of whom carried one of the articles that we had sent indeed the last of them held the bundle of toothpicks on his fuzzy head as though it were a huge faggot of wood one by one they set them down upon the lime flooring of the verandah of the largest hut then their captain said solemnly bausi the great black one has no need of the white men s gifts indeed i replied for my dander was up then he won t get another chance at them the men turned away without more words and presently babemba turned up with a company of about fifty soldiers the king is waiting to see you white lords he said in a voice of very forced jollity and i have come to conduct you to him why would he not accept our presents i asked pointing to the row of them oh that is because of imbozwi s story of the magic shield he said he wanted no gifts to burn his hair off but come come he will explain for himself if the elephant is kept waiting he grows angry and trumpets does he i said and how many of us are to come all all white lord he wishes to see every one of you not me i suppose said sammy who was standing close by i must stop to make ready the food yes you too replied babemba the king would look on the mixer of the holy drink well there was no way out of it so off we marched all well armed as i need not say and were instantly surrounded by the soldiers to give an unusual note to the proceedings i made hans walk first carrying on his head the rejected musical box from which flowed the touching melody of home sweet home then came stephen bearing the union jack on a pole then i in the midst of the hunters and accompanied by babemba then the reluctant sammy and last of all the two donkeys led by mazitus for it seemed that the king had especially ordered that these should be brought also it was a truly striking cavalcade the sight of which under any other circumstances would have made me laugh nor did it fail in its effect for even the silent mazitu people through whom we wended our way were moved to something like enthusiasm home sweet home they evidently thought heavenly though perhaps the two donkeys attracted them most especially when these brayed where are tom and jerry i asked of babemba i don t know he answered i think they have been given leave to go to see their friends imbozwi is suppressing evidence in our favour i thought to myself and said no more presently we reached the gate of the royal enclosure here to my dismay the soldiers insisted on disarming us taking away our rifles our revolvers and even our sheath knives in vain did i remonstrate saying that we were not accustomed to part with these weapons the answer was that it was not lawful for any man to appear before the king armed even with so much as a dancingtick mavovo and the zulus showed signs of resisting and for a minute i thought there was going to be a row which of course would have ended in our massacre for although the mazitus feared guns very much what could we have done against hundreds of them i ordered him to give way but for once he was on the point of disobeying me then by a happy thought i reminded him that according to his snake dogeetah was coming and that therefore all would be well so he submitted with an ill grace and we saw our precious guns borne off we knew not where then the mazitu soldiers piled their spears and bows at the gate of the kraal and we proceeded with only the union jack and the musical box which was now discoursing britannia rules the waves across the open space we marched to where several broadeaved trees grew in front of a large native house not far from the door of this house a fat middleged and angryooking man was seated on a stool naked except for a moocha of catskins about his loins and a string of large blue beads round his neck bausi the king whispered babemba at his side squatted a little hunchbacked figure in whom i had no difficulty in recognising imbozwi although he had painted his scorched scalp white with vermillion spots and adorned his snub nose with a purple tip his dress of ceremony i presume round and behind there were a number of silent councillors at some signal or on reaching a given spot all the soldiers including old babemba fell upon their hands and knees and began to crawl they wanted us to do the same but here i drew the line feeling that if once we crawled we must always crawl so at my word we advanced upright but with slow steps in the midst of all this wriggling humanity and at length found ourselves in the august presence of bausi the beautiful black one king of the mazitu chapter the sentence we stared at bausi and bausi stared at us i am the black elephant bausi he exclaimed at last worn out by our solid silence and i trumpet i trumpet i trumpet it appeared that this was the ancient and hallowed formula with which a mazitu king was wont to open a conversation with strangers after a suitable pause i replied in a cold voice we are the white lions macumazana and wazela and we roar we roar we roar i can trample said bausi and we can bite i said haughtily though how we were to bite or do anything else effectual with nothing but a union jack i did not in the least know what is that thing asked bausi pointing to the flag that which shadows the whole earth i answered proudly a remark that seemed to impress him although he did not at all understand it for he ordered a soldier to hold a palm leaf umbrella over him to prevent it from shadowing him and that he asked again pointing to the music box which is not alive and yet makes a noise that sings the warong of our people i said we sent it to you as a present and you returned it why do you return our presents o bausi then of a sudden this potentate grew furious why do you come here white men he asked uninvited and against the law of my land where only one white man is welcome my brother dogeetah who cured me of sickness with a knife i know who you are you are dealers in men you come here to steal my people and sell them into slavery you had many slaves with you on the borders of my country but you sent them away you shall die you shall die you who call yourselves lions and the painted rag which you say shadows the world shall rot with your bones as for that box which sings a warong i will smash it it shall not bewitch me as your magic shield bewitched my great doctor imbozwi burning off his hair then springing up with wonderful agility for one so fat he knocked the musical box from hans head so that it fell to the ground and after a little whirring grew silent that is right squeaked imbozwi trample on their magic o elephant kill them o black one burn them as they burned my hair now things were i felt very serious for already bausi was looking about him as though to order his soldiers to make an end of us so i said in desperation o king you mentioned a certain white man dogeetah a doctor of doctors who cured you of sickness with a knife and called him your brother well he is our brother also and it was by his invitation that we have come to visit you here where he will meet us presently if dogeetah is your friend then you are my friends answered bausi for in this land he rules as i rule he whose blood flows in my veins as my blood flows in his veins but you lie dogeetah is no brother of slaveealers his heart is good and yours are evil you say that he will meet you here when will he meet you tell me and if it is soon i will hold my hand and wait to hear his report of you before i put you to death for if he speaks well of you you shall not die now i hesitated as well i might for i felt that looking at our case from his point of view bausi believing us to be slaveraders was not angry without cause while i was racking my brains for a reply that might be acceptable to him and would not commit us too deeply to my astonishment mavovo stepped forward and confronted the king who are you fellow shouted bausi i am a warrior o king as my scars show and he pointed to the assegai wounds upon his breast and to his cut nostril i am a chief of a people from whom your people sprang and my name is mavovo mavovo who is ready to fight you or any man whom you may name and to kill him or you if you will is there one here who wishes to be killed no one answered for the mightyhested zulu looked very formidable i am a doctor also went on mavovo one of the greatest of doctors who can open the gates of distance and read that which is hid in the womb of the future therefore i will answer your questions which you put to the lord macumazana the great and wise white man whom i serve because we have fought together in many battles yes i will be his mouth i will answer the white man dogeetah who is your bloodrother and whose word is your word among the mazitu will arrive here at sunset on the second day from now i have spoken bausi looked at me in question yes i exclaimed feeling that i must say something and that it did not much matter what i said dogeetah will arrive here on the second day from now within half an hour after sunset something i know not what prompted me to allow that extra halfour which in the event saved all our lives now bausi consulted a while with the execrable imbozwi and also with the old oneyed general babemba while we watched knowing that our fate hung upon the issue at length he spoke white men he said imbozwi the head of the witchinders here whose hair you burnt off by your evil magic says that it would be better to kill you at once as your hearts are bad and you are planning mischief against my people so i think also but babemba my general with whom i am angry because he did not obey my orders and put you to death on the borders of my country when he met you there with your caravan of slaves thinks otherwise he prays me to hold my hand first because you have bewitched him into liking you and secondly because if you should happen to be speaking the truth hich we do not believe nd to have come here at the invitation of my brother dogeetah he dogeetah would be pained if he arrived and found you dead nor could even he bring you to life again this being so since it matters little whether you die now or later my command is that you be kept prisoners till sunset of the second day from this and that then you will be led out and tied to stakes in the marketlace there to wait till the approach of darkness by when you say dogeetah will be here if he arrives and owns you as his brethren well and good if he does not arrive or disowns you etter still for then you shall be shot to death with arrows as a warning to all other stealers of men not to cross the borders of the mazitu i listened to this atrocious sentence with horror then gasped out we are not stealers of men o king we are freers of men as tom and jerry of your own people could tell you who are tom and jerry he asked indifferently well it does not matter for doubtless they are liars like the rest of you i have spoken take them away feed them well and keep them safe till within an hour of sunset on the second day from this then without giving us any further opportunity of speaking bausi rose and followed by imbozwi and his councillors marched off into his big hut we too were marched off this time under a double guard commanded by someone whom i had not seen before at the gate of the kraal we halted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us no answer was given only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust us along this is a nice business i whispered to stephen oh it doesn t matter he answered there are lots more guns in the huts i am told that these mazitus are dreadfully afraid of bullets so all we have to do is just to break out and shoot our way through them for of course they will run when we begin to fire i looked at him but did not answer for to tell the truth i felt in no mood for argument presently we arrived at our quarters where the soldiers left us to camp outside full of his warlike plan stephen went at once to the hut in which the slavers guns had been stored with our own spare rifles and all the ammunition i saw him emerge looking very blank indeed and asked him what was the matter matter he answered in a voice that for once really was full of dismay the matter is that those mazitu have stolen all the guns and all the ammunition there s not enough powder left to make a blue devil well i replied with the kind of joke one perpetrates under such circumstances we shall have plenty of blue devils without making any more truly ours was a dreadful situation let the reader imagine it within a little more than fortyight hours we were to be shot to death with arrows if an erratic old gentleman who for aught i knew might be dead did not turn up at what was then one of the remotest and most inaccessible spots in central africa moreover our only hope that such a thing would happen if hope it could be called was the prophecy of a kaffir witchoctor to rely on this in any way was so absurd that i gave up thinking of it and set my mind to considering if there were any possible means of escape after hours of reflection i could find none even hans with all his experience and nearly superhuman cunning could suggest none we were unarmed and surrounded by thousands of savages all of whom save perhaps babemba believed us to be slaveraders a race that very properly they held in abhorrence who had visited the country with the object of stealing their women and children the king bausi a very prejudiced fellow was dead against us also by a piece of foolishness which i now bitterly regretted as indeed i regretted the whole expedition or at any rate entering on it in the absence of brother john we had made an implacable enemy of the head medicinean who to these folk was a sort of archbishop of canterbury short of a miracle there was no hope for us all that we could do was to say our prayers and prepare for the end mavovo it is true remained cheerful his faith in his snake was really touching he offered to go through that divination process again in our presence and demonstrate that there was no mistake i declined because i had no faith in divinations and stephen also declined for another reason namely that the result might prove to be different which he held would be depressing the other zulus oscillated between belief and scepticism as do the unstable who set to work to study the evidences of christianity but sammy did not oscillate he literally howled and prepared the food which poured in upon us so badly that i had to turn on hans to do the cooking for however little appetite we might have it was necessary that we should keep up our strength by eating what mr quatermain asked sammy between his tears is the use of dressing viands that our systems will never have time to thoroughly assimilate the first night passed somehow and so did the next day and the next night which heralded our last morning i got up quite early and watched the sunrise never i think had i realised before what a beautiful thing the sunrise is at least not to the extent i did now when i was saying goodye to it for ever unless indeed there should prove to be still lovelier sunrises beyond the dark of death then i went into our hut and as stephen who had the nerves of a rhinoceros was still sleeping like a tortoise in winter i said my prayers earnestly enough mourned over my sins which proved to be so many that at last i gave up the job in despair and then tried to occupy myself by reading the old testament a book to which i have always been extremely attached as a passage that i lit on described how the prophet samuel for whom i could not help reading imbozwi hewed agag in pieces after bausi mean saul ad relented and spared his life i cannot say that it consoled me very much doubtless i reflected these people believe that i like agag had made women childless by my sword so there remained nothing save to follow the example of that unhappy king and walk delicately to doom then as stephen was still sleeping ow could he do it i wondered set to work to make up the accounts of the expedition to date it had already cost just fancy expending in order to be tied to a post and shot to death with arrows and all to get a rare orchid oh i reflected to myself if by some marvel i should escape or if i should live again in any land where these particular flowers flourish i would never even look at them and as a matter of fact i never have at length stephen did wake up and as criminals are reported to do in the papers before execution made an excellent breakfast what s the good of worrying he said presently i shouldn t if it weren t for my poor old father it must have come to this one day and the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep as the song says when one comes to think of it there are enormous advantages in sleep for that s the only time one is quite happy still i should have liked to see that cypripedium first oh drat the cypripedium i exclaimed and blundered from the hut to tell sammy that if he didn t stop his groaning i would punch his head jumps regular jumps who have thought it of quatermain i heard stephen mutter in the intervals of lighting his pipe the morning went like lightning that is greased as sammy remarked three o clock came and mavovo and his following sacrificed a kid to the spirits of their ancestors which as sammy remarked again was a horrible heathen ceremony much calculated to prejudice our cause with powers above when it was over to my delight babemba appeared he looked so pleasant that i jumped to the conclusion that he brought the best of news with him perhaps that the king had pardoned us or perhaps lessed thought hat brother john had really arrived before his time but not a bit of it all he had to say was that he had caused inquiries to be made along the route that ran to the coast and that certainly for a hundred miles there was at present no sign of dogeetah so as the black elephant was growing more and more enraged under the stirrings up of imbozwi it was obvious that that evening s ceremony must be performed indeed as it was part of his duty to superintend the erection of the posts to which we were to be tied and the digging of our graves at their bases he had just come to count us again to be sure that he had not made any mistake as to the number also if there were any articles that we would like buried with us would we be so kind as to point them out and he would be sure to see to the matter it would be soon over and not painful he added as he had selected the very best archers in beza town who rarely missed and could most of them send an arrow up to the feather into a buffalo then he chatted a little about other matters as to where he should find the magic shield i had given him which he would always value as a souvenir etc took a pinch of snuff with mavovo and departed saying that he would be sure to return again at the proper time it was now four o clock and as sammy was quite beyond it stephen made himself some tea it was very good tea especially as we had milk to put in it although i did not remember what it tasted like till afterwards now having abandoned hope i went into a hut alone to compose myself to meet my end like a gentleman and seated there in silence and semiarkness my spirit grew much calmer after all i reflected why should i cling to life in the country whither i travelled as the reader who has followed my adventures will know were some whom i clearly longed to see again notably my father and my mother and two noble women who were even more to me my boy it is true remained he was alive the but i knew that he would find friends and as i was not so badly off at that time i had been able to make a proper provision for him perhaps it was better that i should go seeing that if i lived on it would only mean more troubles and more partings what was about to befall me of course i could not tell but i knew then as i know now that it was not extinction or even that sleep of which stephen had spoken perhaps i was passing to some place where at length the clouds would roll away and i should understand whence too i should see all the landscape of the past and future as an eagle does watching from the skies and be no longer like one struggling through dense bush wildeast and serpent haunted beat upon by the storms of heaven and terrified with its lightnings nor knowing whither i hewed my path perhaps in that place there would be no longer what st paul describes as another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin perhaps there the past would be forgiven by the power which knows whereof we are made and i should become what i have always longed to be in every sense and even find open to me new and better roads of service i take these thoughts from a note that i made in my pocketook at the time thus i reflected and then wrote a few lines of farewell in the fond and foolish hope that somehow they might find those to whom they were addressed i have those letters still and very oddly they read toa this done i tried to throw out my mind towards brother john if he still lived as indeed i had done for days past so that i might inform him of our plight and i am afraid reproach him for having brought us to such an end by his insane carelessness or want of faith whilst i was still engaged thus babemba arrived with his soldiers to lead us off to execution it was hans who came to tell me that he was there the poor old hottentot shook me by the hand and wiped his eyes with his ragged coatleeve oh baas this is our last journey he said and you are going to be killed baas and it is all my fault baas because i ought to have found a way out of the trouble which is what i was hired to do but i can t my head grows so stupid oh if only i could come even with imbozwi i shouldn t mind and i will i will if i have to return as a ghost to do it well baas you know the predikant your father told us that we don t go out like a fire but burn again for always elsewhere i hope not i thought to myself and that quite easily without anything to pay for the wood so i hope that we shall always burn together baas and meanwhile i have brought you a little something and he produced what looked like a peculiarly obnoxious horseball you swallow this now and you will never feel anything it is a very good medicine that my grandfather s grandfather got from the spirit of his tribe you will just go to sleep as nicely as though you were very drunk and wake up in the beautiful fire which burns without any wood and never goes out for ever and ever amen no hans i said i prefer to die with my eyes open and so would i baas if i thought there was any good in keeping them open but i don t for i can t believe any more in the snake of that black fool mavovo if it had been a good snake it would have told him to keep clear of beza town so i will swallow one of these pills and give the other to the baas stephen and he crammed the filthy mess into his mouth and with an effort got it down as a young turkey does a ball of meal that is too big for its throat then as i heard stephen calling me i left him invoking a most comprehensive and polyglot curse upon the head of imbozwi to whom he rightly attributed all our woes our friend here says it is time to start said stephen rather shakily for the situation seemed to have got a hold of him at last and nodding towards old babemba who stood there with a cheerful smile looking as though he were going to conduct us to a wedding yes white lord said babemba it is time and i have hurried so as not to keep you waiting it will be a very fine show for the black elephant himself is going to do you the honour to be present as will all the people of beza town and those for many miles round hold your tongue you old idiot i said and stop your grinning if you had been a man and not a false friend you would have got us out of this trouble knowing as you do very well that we are no sellers of men but rather the enemy of those who do such things oh white lord said babemba in a changed voice believe me i only smile to make you happy up to the end my lips smile but i am crying inside i know that you are good and have told bausi so but he will not believe me who thinks that i have been bribed by you what can i do against that evilearted imbozwi the head of the witchoctors who hates you because he thinks you have better magic than he has and who whispers day and night into the king s ear telling him that if he does not kill you all our people will be slain or sold for slaves as you are only the scouts or a big army that is coming only last night imbozwi held a great divination indaba and read this and a great deal more in the enchanted water making the king think he saw it in pictures whereas i looking over his shoulder could see nothing at all except the ugly face of imbozwi reflected in the water also he swore that his spirit told me that dogeetah the king s bloodrother being dead would never come to beza town again i have done my best keep your heart white towards me o macumazana and do not haunt me for i tell you i have done my best and if ever i should get a chance against imbozwi which i am afraid i shan t as he will poison me first i will pay him back oh he shall not die quickly as you will i wish i could get a chance at him i muttered for even in this solemn moment i could cultivate no christian spirit towards imbozwi feeling that he was honest after all i shook old babemba s hand and gave him the letters i had written asking him to try and get them to the coast then we started on our last walk the zulu hunters were already outside the fence seated on the ground chatting and taking snuff i wondered if this was because they really believed in mavovo s confounded snake or from bravado inspired by the innate courage of their race when they saw me they sprang to their feet and lifting their right hands gave me a loud and hearty salute of inkoosi baba inkoosi macumazana then at a signal from mavovo they broke into some zulu warhant which they kept up till we reached the stakes sammy too broke into a chant but one of quite a different nature be quiet i said to him can t you die like a man no indeed i cannot mr quatermain he answered and went on howling for pity in about twenty different languages stephen and i walked together he still carrying the union jack of which no one tried to deprive him i think the mazitu believed it was his fetish we didn t talk much though once he said well the love of orchids has brought many a man to a bad end i wonder whether the governor will keep my collection or sell it after this he relapsed into silence and not knowing and indeed not caring what would happen to his collection i made no answer we had not far to go personally i could have preferred a longer walk passing with our guards down a kind of bytreet we emerged suddenly at the head of the marketlace to find that it was packed with thousands of people gathered there to see our execution i noticed that they were arranged in orderly companies and that a broad open roadway was left between them running to the southern gate of the market i suppose to facilitate the movements of so large a crowd all this multitude received us in respectful silence though sammy s howls caused some of them to smile while the zulu warhant appeared to excite their wonder or admiration at the head of the marketlace not far from the king s enclosure fifteen stout posts had been planted on as many mounds these mounds were provided so that everyone might see the show and in part at any rate were made of soil hollowed from fifteen deep graves dug almost at the foot of the mounds or rather there were seventeen posts an extra large one being set at each end of the line in order to accommodate the two donkeys which it appeared were also to be shot to death a great number of soldiers kept a space clear in front of the posts on this space were gathered bausi his councillors some of his head wives imbozwi more hideously painted than usual and perhaps fifty or sixty picked archers with strung bows and an ample supply of arrows whose part in the ceremony it was not difficult for us to guess king bausi i said as i was led past that potentate you are a murderer and heaven above will be avenged upon you for this crime if our blood is shed soon you shall die and come to meet us where we have power and your people shall be destroyed my words seemed to frighten the man for he answered i am no murderer i kill you because you are robbers of men moreover it is not i who have passed sentence on you it is imbozwi here the chief of the doctors who has told me all about you and whose spirit says you must die unless my brother dogeetah appears to save you if dogeetah comes which he cannot do because he is dead and vouches for you then i shall know that imbozwi is a wicked liar and as you were to die so he shall die yes yes screeched imbozwi if dogeetah comes as that false wizard prophesies and he pointed to mavovo then i shall be ready to die in your place white slaveealers yes yes then you may shoot me with arrows king take note of those words and people take note of those words that they may be fulfilled if dogeetah comes said mavovo in a great deep voice i take note of them answered bausi and i swear by my mother on behalf of all the people that they shall be fulfilled f dogeetah comes good exclaimed mavovo and stalked on to the stake which had been pointed out to him as he went he whispered something into imbozwi s ear that seemed to frighten that limb of satan for i saw him start and shiver however he soon recovered for in another minute he was engaged in superintending those whose business it was to lash us to the posts this was done simply and effectively by tying our wrists with a grass rope behind these posts each of which was fitted with two projecting pieces of wood that passed under our arms and practically prevented us from moving stephen and i were given the places of honour in the middle the union jack being fixed by his own request to the top of stephen s stake mavovo was on my right and the other zulus were ranged on either side of us hans and sammy occupied the end posts respectively except those to which the poor jackasses were boun i noted that hans was already very sleepy and that shortly after he was fixed up his head dropped forward on his breast evidently his medicine was working and almost i regretted that i had not taken some while i had the chance when we were all fastened imbozwi came round to inspect moreover with a piece of white chalk he made a round mark on the breast of each of us a kind of bull s eye for the archers to aim at ah white man he said to me as he chalked away at my shooting coat you will never burn anyone s hair again with your magic shield never never for presently i shall be treading down the earth upon you in that hole and your goods will belong to me i did not answer for what was the use of talking to this vile brute when my time was so short so he passed on to stephen and began to chalk him stephen however in whom the natural man still prevailed shouted take your filthy hands off me and lifting his leg which was unfettered gave the painted witchoctor such an awful kick in the stomach that he vanished backwards into the grave beneath him ow well done wazela said the zulus we hope that you have killed him i hope so too said stephen and the multitude of spectators gasped to see the sacred person of the head witchoctor of whom they evidently went in much fear treated in such a way only babemba grinned and even the king bausi did not seem displeased but imbozwi was not to be disposed of so easily for presently with the help of sundry myrmidons minor witchoctors he scrambled out of the grave cursing and covered with mud for it was wet down there after that i took no more heed of him or of much else seeing that i had only half an hour to live as may be imagined i was otherwise engaged chapter the coming of dogeetah the sunset that day was like the sunrise particularly fine although as in the case of the tea i remembered little of it till afterwards in fact thunder was about which always produces grand cloud effects in africa the sun went down like a great red eye over which there dropped suddenly a black eyelid of cloud with a fringe of purple lashes there s the last i shall see of you my old friend thought i to myself unless i catch you up presently the gloom began to gather the king looked about him also at the sky overhead as though he feared rain then whispered something to babemba who nodded and strolled up to my post white lord he said the elephant wishes to know if you are ready as presently the light will be very bad for shooting no i answered with decision not till half an hour after sundown as was agreed babemba went to the king and returned to me white lord the king says that a bargain is a bargain and he will keep to his word only you must not then blame him if the shooting is bad since of course he did not know that the night would be so cloudy which is not usual at this time of year it grew darker and darker till at length we might have been lost in a london fog the dense masses of the people looked like banks and the archers flitting to and fro as they made ready might have been shadows in hades once or twice lightning flashed and was followed after a pause by the distant growling of thunder the air too grew very oppressive dense silence reigned in all those multitudes no one spoke or stirred even sammy ceased his howling i suppose because he had become exhausted and fainted away as people often do just before they are hanged it was a most solemn time nature seemed to be adapting herself to the mood of sacrifice and making ready for us a mighty pall at length i heard the sound of arrows being drawn from their quivers and then the squeaky voice of imbozwi saying wait a little the cloud will lift there is light behind it and it will be nicer if they can see the arrows coming the cloud did begin to lift very slowly and from beneath it flowed a green light like that in a cat s eye shall we shoot imbozwi asked the voice of the captain of the archers not yet not yet not till the people can watch them die the edge of cloud lifted a little more the green light turned to a fiery red thrown by the sunk sun and reflected back upon the earth from the dense black cloud above it was as though all the landscape had burst into flames while the heaven over us remained of the hue of ink again the lightning flashed showing the faces and staring eyes of the thousands who watched and even the white teeth of a great bat that flittered past that flash seemed to burn off an edge of the lowering cloud and the light grew stronger and stronger and redder and redder imbozwi uttered a hiss like a snake i heard a bowtring twang and almost at the same moment the thud of an arrow striking my post just above my head indeed by lifting myself i could touch it i shut my eyes and began to see all sorts of queer things that i had forgotten for years and years my brain swam and seemed to melt into a kind of confusion through the intense silence i thought i heard the sound of some animal running heavily much as a fat bull eland does when it is suddenly disturbed someone uttered a startled exclamation which caused me to open my eyes again the first thing i saw was the squad of savage archers lifting their bows vidently that first arrow had been a kind of trial shot the next looking absolutely unearthly in that terrible and ominous light was a tall figure seated on a white ox shambling rapidly towards us along the open roadway that ran from the southern gate of the marketlace of course i knew that i dreamed for this figure exactly resembled brother john there was his long snowy beard there in his hand was his butterfly net with the handle of which he seemed to be prodding the ox only he was wound about with wreaths of flowers as were the great horns of the ox and on either side of him and before and behind him ran girls also wreathed with flowers it was a vision nothing else and i shut my eyes again awaiting the fatal arrow shoot screamed imbozwi nay shoot not shouted babemba dogeetah is come a moment s pause during which i heard arrows falling to the ground then from all those thousands of throats a roar that shaped itself to the words dogeetah dogeetah is come to save the white lords i must confess that after this my nerve which is generally pretty good gave out to such an extent that i think i fainted for a few minutes during that faint i seemed to be carrying on a conversation with mavovo though whether it ever took place or i only imagined it i am not sure since i always forgot to ask him he said or i thought he said to me and now macumazana my father what have you to say does my snake stand upon its tail or does it not answer i am listening to which i replied or seemed to reply mavovo my child certainly it appears as though your snake does stand upon its tail still i hold that all this is a phantasy that we live in a land of dream in which nothing is real except those things which we cannot see or touch or hear that there is no me and no you and no snake at all nothing but a power in which we move that shows us pictures and laughs when we think them real whereon mavovo said or seemed to say ah at last you touch the truth o macumazana my father all things are a shadow and we are shadows in a shadow but what throws the shadow o macumazana my father why does dogeetah appear to come hither riding on a white ox and why do all these thousands think that my snake stands so very stiff upon its tail i hanged if i know i replied and woke up there without doubt was old brother john with a wreath of flowers noted in disgust that they were orchids anging in a bacchanalian fashion from his dinted sunelmet over his left eye he was in a furious rage and reviling bausi who literally crouched before him and i was in a furious rage and reviling him what i said i do not remember but he said his white beard bristling with indignation while he threatened bausi with the handle of the butterfly net you dog you savage whom i saved from death and called brother what were you doing to these white men who are in truth my brothers and to their followers were you about to kill them oh if so i will forget my vow i will forget the bond that binds us and don t pray don t said bausi it is all a horrible mistake i am not to be blamed at all it is that witchoctor imbozwi whom by the ancient law of the land i must obey in such matters he consulted his spirit and declared that you were dead also that these white lords were the most wicked of men slaveraders with spotted hearts who came hither to spy out the mazitu people and to destroy them with magic and bullets then he lied thundered brother john and he knew that he lied yes yes it is evident that he lied answered bausi bring him here and with him those who serve him now by the light of the moon which was shining brightly in the heavens for the thunderlouds had departed with the last glow of sunset soldiers began an active search for imbozwi and his confederates of these they caught eight or ten all wickedooking fellows hideously painted and adorned like their master but imbozwi himself they could not find i began to think that in the confusion he had given us the slip when presently from the far end of the line for we were still all tied to our stakes i heard the voice of sammy hoarse it is true but quite cheerful now saying mr quatermain in the interests of justice will you inform his majesty that the treacherous wizard for whom he is seeking is now peeping and muttering at the bottom of the grave which was dug to receive my mortal remains i did inform his majesty and in doubleuick time our friend imbozwi was once more fished out of a grave by the strong arms of babemba and his soldiers and dragged into the presence of the irate bausi loose the white lords and their followers said bausi and let them come here so our bonds were undone and we walked to where the king and brother john stood the miserable imbozwi and his attendant doctors huddled in a heap before them who is this said bausi to him pointing at brother john is it not he whom you vowed was dead imbozwi did not seem to think that the question required an answer so bausi continued what was the song that you sang in our ears just now hat if dogeetah came you would be ready to be shot to death with arrows in the place of these white lords whose lives you swore away was it not again imbozwi made no answer although babemba called his attention to the king s query with a vigorous kick then bausi shouted by your own mouth are you condemned o liar and that shall be done to you which you have yourself decreed adding almost in the words of elijah after he had triumphed over the priests of baal take away these false prophets let none of them escape say you not so o people aye roared the multitude fiercely take them away not a popular character imbozwi stephen remarked to me in a reflective voice well he is going to be served hot on his own toast now and serve the brute right who is the false doctor now mocked mavovo in the silence that followed who is about to sup on arroweads o painterfhitepots and he pointed to the mark that imbozwi had so gleefully chalked over his heart as a guide to the arrows of the archers now seeing that all was lost the little humpbacked villain with a sudden twist caught me by the legs and began to plead for mercy so piteously did he plead that being already softened by the fact of our wonderful escape from those black graves my heart was melted in me i turned to ask the king to spare his life though with little hope that the prayer would be granted for i saw that bausi feared and hated the man and was only too glad of the opportunity to be rid of him imbozwi however interpreted my movement differently since among savages the turning of the back always means that a petition is refused then in his rage and despair the venom of his wicked heart boiled over he leapt to his feet and drawing a big carved knife from among his witchoctor s trappings sprang at me like a wild cat shouting at least you shall come too white dog most mercifully mavovo was watching him for that is a good zulu saying which declares that wizard is wizard s fate with one bound he was on him just as the knife touched me t actually pricked my skin though without drawing blood which was fortunate as probably it was poisoned e gripped imbozwi s arm in his grasp of iron and hurled him to the ground as though he were but a child after this of course all was over come away i said to stephen and brother john this is no place for us so we went and gained our huts without molestation and indeed quite unobserved for the attention of everyone in beza town was fully occupied elsewhere from the marketlace behind us rose so hideous a clamour that we rushed into my hut and shut the door to escape or lessen the sound it was dark in the hut for which i was really thankful for the darkness seemed to soothe my nerves especially was this so when brother john said friend allan quatermain and you young gentleman whose name i don t know i will tell you what i think i never mentioned to you before that in addition to being a doctor i am a clergyman of the american episcopalian church well as a clergyman i will ask your leave to return thanks for your very remarkable deliverance from a cruel death by all means i muttered for both of us and he did so in a most earnest and beautiful prayer brother john may or may not have been a little touched in the head at this time of his life but he was certainly an able and a good man afterwards as the shrieks and shouting had now died down to a confused murmur of many voices we went and sat outside under the projecting eaves of the hut where i introduced stephen somers to brother john and now i said in the name of goodness where do you come from tied up in flowers like a roman priest at sacrifice and riding on a bull like the lady called europa and what on earth do you mean by playing us such a scurvy trick down there in durban leaving us without a word after you had agreed to guide us to this hellish hole brother john stroked his long beard and looked at me reproachfully i guess allan he said in his american fashion there is a mistake somewhere to answer the last part of your question first i did not leave you without a word i gave a letter to that lame old griqua gardener of yours jack to be handed to you when you arrived then the idiot either lost it and lied to me as griquas will or he forgot all about it that is likely i ought to have thought of that allan but i didn t well in that letter i said that i would meet you here where i should have been six weeks ago awaiting you also i sent a message to bausi to warn him of your coming in case i should be delayed but i suppose that something happened to it on the road why did you not wait and come with us like a sensible man allan as you ask me straight out i will tell you although the subject is one of which i do not care to speak i knew that you were going to journey by kilwa indeed it was your only route with a lot of people and so much baggage and i did not wish to visit kilwa he paused then went on a long while ago nearly twentyhree years to be accurate i went to live at kilwa as a missionary with my young wife i built a mission station and a church there and we were happy and fairly successful in our work then on one evil day the swahili and other arabs came in dhows to establish a slaveealing station i resisted them and the end of it was that they attacked us killed most of my people and enslaved the rest in that attack i received a cut from a sword on the head here is the mark of it and drawing his white hair apart he showed us a long scar that was plainly visible in the moonlight the blow knocked me senseless just about sunset one evening when i came to myself again it was broad daylight and everybody was gone except one old woman who was tending me she was halfrazed with grief because her husband and two sons had been killed and another son a boy and a daughter had been taken away i asked her where my young wife was she answered that she too had been taken away eight or ten hours before because the arabs had seen the lights of a ship out at sea and thought they might be those of a british manfar that was known to be cruising on the coast on seeing these they had fled inland in a hurry leaving me for dead but killing the wounded before they went the old woman herself had escaped by hiding among some rocks on the seashore and after the arabs had gone had crept back to the house and found me still alive i asked her where my wife had been taken she said she did not know but some others of our people told her that they had heard the arabs say they were going to some place a hundred miles inland to join their leader a halfred villain named hassanenohammed to whom they were carrying my wife as a present now we knew this wretch for after the arabs landed at kilwa but before actual hostilities broke out between us he had fallen sick of smallpox and my wife had helped to nurse him had it not been for her indeed he would have died however although the leader of the band he was not present at the attack being engaged in some slaveaiding business in the interior when i learned this terrible news the shock of it or the loss of blood brought on a return of insensibility from which i only awoke two days later to find myself on board a dutch trading vessel that was sailing for zanzibar it was the lights of this ship that the arabs had seen and mistaken for those of an english manfar she had put into kilwa for water and the sailors finding me on the verandah of the house and still living in the goodness of their hearts carried me on board of the old woman they had seen nothing i suppose that at their approach she ran away at zanzibar in an almost dying condition i was handed over to a clergyman of our mission in whose house i lay desperately ill for a long while indeed six months went by before i fully recovered my right mind some people say that i have never recovered it perhaps you are one of them allan at last the wound in my skull healed after a clever english naval surgeon had removed some bits of splintered bone and my strength came back to me i was and still am an american subject and in those days we had no consul at zanzibar if there is one there now of which i am not sure and of course no warship the english made what inquiries they could for me but could find out little or nothing since all the country about kilwa was in possession of arab slaveraders who were supported by a ruffian who called himself the sultan of zanzibar again he paused as though overcome by the sadness of his recollections did you never hear any more of your wife asked stephen yes mr somers i heard at zanzibar from a slave whom our mission bought and freed that he had seen a white woman who answered to her description alive and apparently well at some place i was unable to identify he could only tell me that it was fifteen days journey from the coast she was then in charge of some black people he did not know of what tribe who he believed had found her wandering in the bush he noted that the black people seemed to treat her with the greatest reverence although they could not understand what she said on the following day whilst searching for six lost goats he was captured by arabs who he heard afterwards were out looking for this white woman the day after the man had told me this he was seized with inflammation of the lungs of which being in a weak state from his sufferings in the slave gang he quickly died now you will understand why i was not particularly anxious to revisit kilwa yes i said we understand that and a good deal more of which we will talk later but to change the subject where do you come from now and how did you happen to turn up just in the nick of time i was journeying here across country by a route i will show you on my map he answered when i met with an accident to my leg here stephen and i looked at each othe which kept me laid up in a kaffir hut for six weeks when i got better as i could not walk very well i rode upon oxen that i had trained that white beast you saw is the last of them the others died of the bite of the tsetse fly a fear which i could not define caused me to press forward as fast as possible for the last twentyour hours i have scarcely stopped to eat or sleep when i got into the mazitu country this morning i found the kraals empty except for some women and girls who knew me again and threw these flowers over me they told me that all the men had gone to beza town for a great feast but what the feast was they either did not know or would not reveal so i hurried on and arrived in time hank god in time it is a long story i will tell you the details afterwards now we are all too tired what s that noise i listened and recognised the triumphant song of the zulu hunters who were returning from the savage scene in the marketlace presently they arrived headed by sammy a very different sammy from the wailing creature who had gone out to execution an hour or two before now he was the gayest of the gay and about his neck were strung certain weird ornaments which i identified as the personal property of imbozwi virtue is victorious and justice has been done mr quatermain these are the spoils of war he said pointing to the trappings of the late witchoctor oh get out you little cur we want to know nothing more i said go cook us some supper and he went not in the least abashed the hunters were carrying between them what appeared to be the body of hans at first i was frightened thinking that he must be dead but examination showed that he was only in a state of insensibility such as might be induced by laudanum brother john ordered him to be wrapped up in a blanket and laid by the fire and this was done presently mavovo approached and squatted down in front of us macumazana my father he said quietly what words have you for me words of thanks mavovo if you had not been so quick imbozwi would have finished me as it is the knife only touched my skin without breaking it for dogeetah has looked to see mavovo waved his hand as though to sweep this little matter aside and asked looking me straight in the eyes and what other words macumazana as to my snake i mean only that you were right and i was wrong i answered shamefacedly things have happened as you foretold how or why i do not understand no my father because you white men are so vain blown out was his wor that you think you have all wisdom now you have learned that this is not so i am content the false doctors are all dead my father and i think that imbozwi i held up my hand not wishing to hear details mavovo rose and with a little smile went about his business what does he mean about his snake inquired brother john curiously i told him as briefly as i could and asked him if he could explain the matter he shook his head the strangest example of native vision that i have ever heard of he answered and the most useful explain there is no explanation except the old one that there are more things in heaven and earth etc and that god gives different gifts to different men then we ate our supper i think one of the most joyful meals of which i have ever partaken it is wonderful how good food tastes when one never expected to swallow another mouthful after it was finished the others went to bed but with the still unconscious hans for my only companion i sat for a while smoking by the fire for on this high tableland the air was chilly i felt that as yet i could not sleep if for no other reason because of the noise that the mazitu were making in the town i suppose in celebration of the execution of the terrible witchoctors and the return of dogeetah suddenly hans awoke and sitting up stared at me through the bright flame which i had recently fed with dry wood baas he said in a hollow voice there you are here i am and there is the fire which never goes out a very good fire but baas why are we not inside of it as your father the predikant promised instead of outside here in the cold because you are still in the world you old fool and not where you deserve to be i answered because mavovo s snake was a snake with a true tongue after all and dogeetah came as it foretold because we are all alive and well and it is imbozwi with his spawn who are dead upon the posts that is why hans as you would have seen for yourself if you had kept awake instead of swallowing filthy medicine like a frightened woman just because you were afraid of death which at your age you ought to have welcomed oh baas broke in hans don t tell me that things are so and that we are really alive in what your honoured father used to call this gourd full of tears don t tell me baas that i made a coward of myself and swallowed that beastliness f you knew what it was made of you would understand baas or nothing but a bad headache don t tell me that dogeetah came when my eyes were not open to see him and worst of all that imbozwi and his children were tied to those poles when i was not able to help them out of the bottle of tears into the fire that burns for ever and ever oh it is too much and i swear baas that however often i have to die henceforward it shall always be with my eyes open and holding his aching head between his hands he rocked himself to and fro in bitter grief well might hans be sad seeing that he never heard the last of the incident the hunters invented a new and gigantic name for him which meant the littleellowousehoeedsnleephilehelackats eatpheirnemies even sammy made a mock of him showing him the spoils which he declared he had wrenched unaided from the mighty master of magic imbozwi as indeed he had fter the said imbozwi was stone dead at the stake it was very amusing until things grew so bad that i feared hans would kill sammy and had to put a stop to the joke chapter brother john s story although i went to bed late i was up before sunrise chiefly because i wished to have some private conversation with brother john whom i knew to be a very early riser indeed he slept less than any man i ever met as i expected i found him astir in his hut he was engaged in pressing flowers by candlelight john i said i have brought you some property which i think you have lost and i handed him the moroccoound christian year and the waterolour drawing which we had found in the sacked mission house at kilwa he looked first at the picture and then at the book at least i suppose he did for i went outside the hut for a while o observe the sunrise in a few minutes he called me and when the door was shut said in an unsteady voice how did you come by these relics allan i told him the story from beginning to end he listened without a word and when i had finished said i may as well tell what perhaps you have guessed that the picture is that of my wife and the book is her book is i exclaimed yes allan i say is because i do not believe that she is dead i cannot explain why any more than i could explain last night how that great zulu savage was able to prophesy my coming but sometimes we can wring secrets from the unknown and i believe that i have won this truth in answer to my prayers that my wife still lives after twenty years john yes after twenty years why do you suppose he asked almost fiercely that for twohirds of a generation i have wandered about among african savages pretending to be crazy because these wild people revere the mad and always let them pass unharmed i thought it was to collect butterflies and botanical specimens butterflies and botanical specimens these were the pretext i have been and am searching for my wife you may think it a folly especially considering what was her condition when we separated he was expecting a child allan ut i do not i believe that she is hidden away among some of these wild peoples then perhaps it would be as well not to find her i answered bethinking me of the fate which had overtaken sundry white women in the old days who had escaped from shipwrecks on the coast and become the wives of kaffirs not so allan on that point i fear nothing if god has preserved my wife he has also protected her from every harm and now he went on you will understand why i wish to visit these pongo he pongo who worship a white goddess i understand i said and left him for having learned all there was to know i thought it best not to prolong a painful conversation to me it seemed incredible that this lady should still live and i feared the effect upon him of the discovery that she was no more how full of romance is this poor little world of ours think of brother john eversley was his real name as i discovered afterward and what his life had been a highinded educated man trying to serve his faith in the dark places of the earth and taking his young wife with him which for my part i have never considered a right thing to do neither tradition nor holy writ record that the apostles dragged their wives and families into the heathen lands where they went to preach although i believe that some of them were married but this is by the way then falls the blow the mission house is sacked the husband escapes by a miracle and the poor young lady is torn away to be the prey of a vile slaverader lastly according to the quite unreliable evidence of some savage already in the shadow of death she is seen in the charge of other unknown savages on the strength of this the husband playing the part of a mad botanist hunts for her for a score of years enduring incredible hardships and yet buoyed up by a high and holy trust to my mind it was a beautiful and pathetic story still for reasons which i have suggested i confess that i hoped that long ago she had returned into the hands of the power which made her for what would be the state of a young white lady who for two decades had been at the mercy of these black brutes and yet and yet after my experience of mavovo and his snake i did not feel inclined to dogmatise about anything who and what was i that i should venture not only to form opinions but to thrust them down the throats of others after all how narrow are the limits of the knowledge upon which we base our judgments perhaps the great sea of intuition that surrounds us is safer to float on than are these little islets of individual experience whereon we are so wont to take our stand meanwhile my duty was not to speculate on the dreams and mental attitudes of others but like a practical hunter and trader to carry to a successful issue an expedition that i was well paid to manage and to dig up a certain rare flower root if i could find it in the marketable value of which i had an interest i have always prided myself upon my entire lack of imagination and all such mental phantasies and upon an aptitude for hard business and an appreciation of the facts of life that after all are the things with which we have to do this is the truth at least i hope it is for if i were to be quite honest which no one ever has been except a gentleman named mr pepys who i think lived in the reign of charles and who to judge from his memoirs which i have read lately did not write for publication i should have to admit that there is another side to my nature i sternly suppress it however at any rate for the present while we were at breakfast hans who still suffering from headache and remorse was lurking outside the gateway far from the madding crowd of critics crept in like a beaten dog and announced that babemba was approaching followed by a number of laden soldiers i was about to advance to receive him then i remembered that owing to a queer native custom such as that which caused sir theophilus shepstone whom i used to know very well to be recognised as the holder of the spirit of the great chaka and therefore as the equal of the zulu monarchs brother john was the really important man in our company so i gave way and asked him to be good enough to take my place and to live up to that station in savage life to which it had pleased god to call him i am bound to say he rose to the occasion very well being by nature and appearance a dignified old man swallowing his coffee in a hurry he took his place at a little distance from us and stood there in a statuesque pose to him entered babemba crawling on his hands and knees and other native gentlemen likewise crawling also the burdened soldiers in as obsequious an attitude as their loads would allow o king dogeetah said babemba your brother king bausi returns the guns and fireoods of the white men your children and sends certain gifts glad to hear it general babemba said brother john although it would be better if he had never taken them away put them down and get on to your feet i do not like to see men wriggling on their stomachs like monkeys the order was obeyed and we checked the guns and ammunition also our revolvers and the other articles that had been taken away from us nothing was missing or damaged and in addition there were four fine elephant s tusks an offering to stephen and myself which as a business man i promptly accepted some karosses and mazitu weapons presents to mavovo and the hunters a beautiful native bedstead with ivory legs and mats of finelyoven grass a gift to hans in testimony to his powers of sleep under trying circumstances the zulus roared when they heard this and hans vanished cursing behind the hut and for sammy a weird musical instrument with a request that in future he would use it in public instead of his voice sammy i may add did not see the joke any more than hans had done but the rest of us appreciated the mazitu sense of humour very much it is very well mr quatermain he said for these black babes and sucklings to sit in the seat of the scornful on such an occasion silent prayers would have been of little use but i am certain that my loud crying to heaven delivered you all from the bites of the heathen arrows o dogeetah and white lords said babemba the king invites your presence that he may ask your forgiveness for what has happened and this time there will be no need for you to bring arms since henceforward no hurt can come to you from the mazitu people so presently we set out once more taking with us the gifts that had been refused our march to the royal quarters was a veritable triumphal progress the people prostrated themselves and clapped their hands slowly in salutation as we passed while the girls and children pelted us with flowers as though we were brides going to be married our road ran by the place of execution where the stakes at which i confess i looked with a shiver were still standing though the graves had been filled in on our arrival bausi and his councillors rose and bowed to us indeed the king did more for coming forward he seized brother john by the hand and insisted upon rubbing his ugly black nose against that of this revered guest this it appeared was the mazitu method of embracing an honour which brother john did not seem at all to appreciate then followed long speeches washed down with draughts of thick native beer bausi explained that his evil proceedings were entirely due to the wickedness of the deceased imbozwi and his disciples under whose tyranny the land had groaned for long since the people believed them to speak with the voice of heaven above brother john on our behalf accepted the apology and then read a lecture or rather preached a sermon that took exactly twentyive minutes to deliver he is rather long in the win in which he demonstrated the evils of superstition and pointed to a higher and a better path bausi replied that he would like to hear more of that path another time which as he presumed that we were going to spend the rest of our lives in his company could easily be found ay during the next spring when the crops had been sown and the people had leisure on their hands after this we presented our gifts which now were eagerly accepted then i took up my parable and explained to bausi that so far from stopping in beza town for the rest of our lives we were anxious to press forward at once to pongoand the king s face fell as did those of his councillors listen o lord macumazana and all of you he said these pongo are horrible wizards a great and powerful people who live by themselves amidst the swamps and with none if the pongo catch mazitu or folk of any other tribe either they kill them or take them as prisoners to their own land where they enslave them or sometimes sacrifice them to the devils they worship that is so broke in babemba for when i was a lad i was a slave to the pongo and doomed to be sacrificed to the white devil it was in escaping from them that i lost this eye needless to say i made a note of this remark though i did not think the moment opportune to follow the matter up if babemba has once been to pongoand i reflected to myself babemba can go again or show us the way there and if we catch any of the pongo went on bausi as sometimes we do when they come to hunt for slaves we kill them ever since the mazitu have been in this place there has been hate and war between them and the pongo and if i could wipe out those evil ones then i should die happily
