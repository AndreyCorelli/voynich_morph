the episode of the patient who disappointed her doctor hilda wade gift was so unique so extraordinary that i must illustrate it i think before i attempt to describe it but first let me say a word of explanation about the master i have never met anyone who impressed me so much with a sense of greatness as professor sebastian and this was not due to his scientific eminence alone the man strength and keenness struck me quite as forcibly as his vast attainments when he first came to st nathaniel hospital an eager fieryyed physiologist well past the prime of life and began to preach with all the electric force of his vivid personality that the one thing on earth worth a young man doing was to work in his laboratory attend his lectures study disease and be a scientific doctor dozens of us were infected by his contagious enthusiasm he proclaimed the gospel of germs and the germ of his own zeal flew abroad in the hospital it ran through the wards as if it were typhoid fever within a few months half the students were converted from lukewarm observers of medical routine into flaming apostles of the new methods the greatest authority in europe on comparative anatomy now that huxley was taken from us he had devoted his later days to the pursuit of medicine proper to which he brought a mind stored with luminous analogies from the lower animals his very appearance held one tall thin erect with an ascetic profile not unlike cardinal manning he represented that abstract form of asceticism which consists in absolute selfacrifice to a mental ideas not that which consists in religious abnegation three years of travel in africa had tanned his skin for life his long white hair straight and silvery as it fell just curled in one waveike inward sweep where it turned and rested on the stooping shoulders his pale face was cleanhaven save for a thin and wiry grizzled moustache which cast into stronger relief the deepet hawkike eyes and the acute intense intellectual features in some respects his countenance reminded me often of dr martineau in others it recalled the knifeike edge unturnable of his great predecessor professor owen wherever he went men turned to stare at him in paris they took him for the head of the english socialists in russia they declared he was a nihilist emissary and they were not far wrong n essence for sebastian stern sharp face was above all things the face of a man absorbed and engrossed by one overpowering pursuit in life he sacred thirst of knowledge which had swallowed up his entire nature he was what he looked he most singleinded person i have ever come across and when i say singleinded i mean just that and no more he had an end to attain he advancement of science and he went straight towards the end looking neither to the right nor to the left for anyone an american millionaire once remarked to him of some ingenious appliance he was describing why if you were to perfect that apparatus professor and take out a patent for it i reckon you make as much money as i have made sebastian withered him with a glance i have no time to waste he replied on making money so when hilda wade told me on the first day i met her that she wished to become a nurse at nathaniel to be near sebastian i was not at all astonished i took her at her word everybody who meant business in any branch of the medical art however humble desired to be close to our rare teacher o drink in his large thought to profit by his clear insight his wide experience the man of nathaniel was revolutionising practice and those who wished to feel themselves abreast of the modern movement were naturally anxious to cast in their lot with him i did not wonder therefore that hilda wade who herself possessed in so large a measure the deepest feminine gift ntuition hould seek a place under the famous professor who represented the other side of the same endowment in its masculine embodiment nstinct of diagnosis hilda wade herself i will not formally introduce to you you will learn to know her as i proceed with my story i was sebastian assistant and my recommendation soon procured hilda wade the post she so strangely coveted before she had been long at nathaniel however it began to dawn upon me that her reasons for desiring to attend upon our revered master were not wholly and solely scientific sebastian it is true recognised her value as a nurse from the first he not only allowed that she was a good assistant but he also admitted that her subtle knowledge of temperament sometimes enabled her closely to approach his own reasoned scientific analysis of a case and its probable development most women he said to me once are quick at reading the passing emotion they can judge with astounding correctness from a shadow on one face a catch in one breath a movement of one hands how their words or deeds are affecting us we cannot conceal our feelings from them but underlying character they do not judge so well as fleeting expression not what mrs jones is in herself but what mrs jones is now thinking and feeling here lies their great success as psychologists most men on the contrary guide their life by definite facts y signs by symptoms by observed data medicine itself is built upon a collection of such reasoned facts but this woman nurse wade to a certain extent stands intermediate mentally between the two sexes she recognises temperament he fixed form of character and what it is likely to do n a degree which i have never seen equalled elsewhere to that extent and within proper limits of supervision i acknowledge her faculty as a valuable adjunct to a scientific practitioner still though sebastian started with a predisposition in favour of hilda wade pretty girl appeals to most of us could see from the beginning that hilda wade was by no means enthusiastic for sebastian like the rest of the hospital he is extraordinarily able she would say when i gushed to her about our master but that was the most i could ever extort from her in the way of praise though she admitted intellectually sebastian gigantic mind she would never commit herself to anything that sounded like personal admiration to call him the prince of physiologists did not satisfy me on that head i wanted her to exclaim i adore him i worship him he is glorious wonderful i was also aware from an early date that in an unobtrusive way hilda wade was watching sebastian watching him quietly with those wistful earnest eyes as a cat watches a mouseole watching him with mute inquiry as if she expected each moment to see him do something different from what the rest of us expected of him slowly i gathered that hilda wade in the most literal sense had come to nathaniel as she herself expressed it to be near sebastian gentle and lovable as she was in every other aspect towards sebastian she seemed like a lynxyed detective she had some object in view i thought almost as abstract as his own ome object to which as i judged she was devoting her life quite as singleindedly as sebastian himself had devoted his to the advancement of science why did she become a nurse at all i asked once of her friend mrs mallet she has plenty of money and seems well enough off to live without working oh dear yes mrs mallet answered she is independent quite has a tidy little income of her own or seven hundred a year nd she could choose her own society but she went in for this mission fad early she didn intend to marry she said so she would like to have some work to do in life girls suffer like that nowadays in her case the malady took the form of nursing as a rule i ventured to interpose when a pretty girl says she doesn intend to marry her remark is premature it only means oh yes i know every girl says it is a stock property in the popular masque of maiden modesty but with hilda it is different and the difference is hat hilda means it you are right i answered i believe she means it yet i know one man at least for i admired her immensely mrs mallet shook her head and smiled it is no use dr cumberledge she answered hilda will never marry never that is to say till she has attained some mysterious object she seems to have in view about which she never speaks to anyone ot even to me but i have somehow guessed it and it is oh i have not guessed what it is i am no oedipus i have merely guessed that it exists but whatever it may be hilda life is bounded by it she became a nurse to carry it out i feel confident from the very beginning i gather a part of her scheme was to go to st nathaniel she was always bothering us to give her introductions to dr sebastian and when she met you at my brother hugo it was a preconcerted arrangement she asked to sit next you and meant to induce you to use your influence on her behalf with the professor she was dying to get there it is very odd i mused but there omen are inexplicable and hilda is in that matter the very quintessence of woman even i who have known her for years don pretend to understand her a few months later sebastian began his great researches on his new anaesthetic it was a wonderful set of researches it promised so well all nat as we familiarly and affectionately styled st nathanie was in a fever of excitement over the drug for a twelvemonth the professor obtained his first hint of the new body by a mere accident his friend the deputy prosector of the zoological society had mixed a draught for a sick raccoon at the gardens and by some mistake in a bottle had mixed it wrongly i purposely refrain from mentioning the ingredients as they are drugs which can be easily obtained in isolation at any chemist though when compounded they form one of the most dangerous and difficult to detect of organic poisons i do not desire to play into the hands of woulde criminals the compound on which the deputy prosector had thus accidentally lighted sent the raccoon to sleep in the most extraordinary manner indeed the raccoon slept for thirtyix hours on end all attempts to awake him by pulling his tail or tweaking his hair being quite unavailing this was a novelty in narcotics so sebastian was asked to come and look at the slumbering brute he suggested the attempt to perform an operation on the somnolent raccoon by removing under the influence of the drug an internal growth which was considered the probable cause of his illness a surgeon was called in the growth was found and removed and the raccoon to everybody surprise continued to slumber peacefully on his straw for five hours afterwards at the end of that time he awoke and stretched himself as if nothing had happened and though he was of course very weak from loss of blood he immediately displayed a most royal hunger he ate up all the maize that was offered him for breakfast and proceeded to manifest a desire for more by most unequivocal symptoms sebastian was overjoyed he now felt sure he had discovered a drug which would supersede chloroform drug more lasting in its immediate effects and yet far less harmful in its ultimate results on the balance of the system a name being wanted for it he christened it lethodyne it was the best painuller yet invented for the next few weeks at nat we heard of nothing but lethodyne patients recovered and patients died but their deaths or recoveries were as dross to lethodyne an anaesthetic that might revolutionise surgery and even medicine a royal road through disease with no trouble to the doctor and no pain to the patient lethodyne held the field we were all of us for the moment intoxicated with lethodyne sebastian observations on the new agent occupied several months he had begun with the raccoon he went on of course with those poor scapegoats of physiology domestic rabbits not that in this particular case any painful experiments were in contemplation the professor tried the drug on a dozen or more quite healthy young animals ith the strange result that they dozed off quietly and never woke up again this nonplussed sebastian he experimented once more on another raccoon with a smaller dose the raccoon fell asleep and slept like a top for fifteen hours at the end of which time he woke up as if nothing out of the common had happened sebastian fell back upon rabbits again with smaller and smaller doses it was no good the rabbits all died with great unanimity until the dose was so diminished that it did not send them off to sleep at all there was no middle course apparently to the rabbit kind lethodyne was either fatal or else inoperative so it proved to sheep the new drug killed or did nothing i will not trouble you with all the details of sebastian further researches the curious will find them discussed at length in volume of the philosophical transactions see also comptes rendus de lcademie de medecine tome and sequel i will restrict myself here to that part of the inquiry which immediately refers to hilda wade history if i were you she said to the professor one morning when he was most astonished at his contradictory results i would test it on a hawk if i dare venture on a suggestion i believe you will find that hawks recover the deuce they do sebastian cried however he had such confidence in nurse wade judgment that he bought a couple of hawks and tried the treatment on them both birds took considerable doses and after a period of insensibility extending to several hours woke up in the end quite bright and lively i see your principle the professor broke out it depends upon diet carnivores and birds of prey can take lethodyne with impunity herbivores and fruitaters cannot recover and die of it man therefore being partly carnivorous will doubtless be able more or less to stand it hilda wade smiled her sphinxike smile not quite that i fancy she answered it will kill cats i feel sure at least most domesticated ones but it will not kill weasels yet both are carnivores that young woman knows too much sebastian muttered to me looking after her as she glided noiselessly with her gentle tread down the long white corridor we shall have to suppress her cumberledge but il wager my life she right for all that i wonder now how the dickens she guessed it intuition i answered he pouted his under lip above the upper one with a dubious acquiescence inference i call it he retorted all woman soalled intuition is in fact just rapid and halfnconscious inference he was so full of the subject however and so utterly carried away by his scientific ardour that i regret to say he gave a strong dose of lethodyne at once to each of the matron petted and pampered persian cats which lounged about her room and were the delight of the convalescents they were two peculiarly lazy sultanas of cats ere jewels of the harem riental beauties that loved to bask in the sun or curl themselves up on the rug before the fire and dawdle away their lives in congenial idleness strange to say hilda prophecy came true zuleika settled herself down comfortably in the professor easy chair and fell into a sound sleep from which there was no awaking while roxana met fate on the tigerkin she loved coiled up in a circle and passed from this life of dreams without knowing it into one where dreaming is not sebastian noted the facts with a quiet gleam of satisfaction in his watchful eye and explained afterwards with curt glibness to the angry matron that her favourites had been canonised in the roll of science as painless martyrs to the advancement of physiology the weasels on the other hand with an equal dose woke up after six hours as lively as crickets it was clear that carnivorous tastes were not the whole solution for roxana was famed as a notable mouser your principle sebastian asked our sibyl in his brief quick way hilda cheek wore a glow of pardonable triumph the great teacher had deigned to ask her assistance i judged by the analogy of indian hemp she answered this is clearly a similar but much stronger narcotic now whenever i have given indian hemp by your direction to people of sluggish or even of merely bustling temperament i have noticed that small doses produce serious effects and that the afteresults are most undesirable but when you have prescribed the hemp for nervous overstrung imaginative people i have observed that they can stand large amounts of the tincture without evil results and that the afterffects pass off rapidly i who am mercurial in temperament for example can take any amount of indian hemp without being made ill by it while ten drops will send some slow and torpid rustics mad drunk with excitement rive them into homicidal mania sebastian nodded his head he needed no more explanation you have hit it he said i see it at a glance the old antithesis all men and all animals fall roughly speaking into two great divisions of type the impassioned and the unimpassioned the vivid and the phlegmatic i catch your drift now lethodyne is poison to phlegmatic patients who have not active power enough to wake up from it unhurt it is relatively harmless to the vivid and impassioned who can be put asleep by it indeed for a few hours more or less but are alive enough to live on through the coma and reassert their vitality after it i recognised as he spoke that this explanation was correct the dull rabbits the sleepy persian cats and the silly sheep had died outright of lethodyne the cunning inquisitive raccoon the quick hawk and the active intenseatured weasels all most eager wary and alert animals full of keenness and passion had recovered quickly dare we try it on a human subject i asked tentatively hilda wade answered at once with that unerring rapidity of hers yes certainly on a few he right persons i for one am not afraid to try it you i cried feeling suddenly aware how much i thought of her oh not you please nurse wade some other life less valuable sebastian stared at me coldly nurse wade volunteers he said it is in the cause of science who dares dissuade her that tooth of yours ah yes quite sufficient excuse you wanted it out nurse wade wellsinton shall operate without a moment hesitation hilda wade sat down in an easy chair and took a measured dose of the new anaesthetic proportioned to the average difference in weight between raccoons and humanity my face displayed my anxiety i suppose for she turned to me smiling with quiet confidence i know my own constitution she said with a reassuring glance that went straight to my heart i do not in the least fear as for sebastian he administered the drug to her as unconcernedly as if she were a rabbit sebastian scientific coolness and calmness have long been the admiration of younger practitioners wellsinton gave one wrench the tooth came out as though the patient were a block of marble there was not a cry or a movement such as one notes when nitrous oxide is administered hilda wade was to all appearance a mass of lifeless flesh we stood round and watched i was trembling with terror even on sebastian pale face usually so unmoved save by the watchful eagerness of scientific curiosity i saw signs of anxiety after four hours of profound slumber reath hovering as it seemed between life and death he began to come to again in half an hour more she was wide awake she opened her eyes and asked for a glass of hock with beef essence or oysters that evening by six olock she was quite well and able to go about her duties as usual sebastian is a wonderful man i said to her as i entered her ward on my rounds at night his coolness astonishes me do you know he watched you all the time you were lying asleep there as if nothing were the matter coolness she inquired in a quiet voice or cruelty cruelty i echoed aghast sebastian cruel oh nurse wade what an idea why he has spent his whole life in striving against all odds to alleviate pain he is the apostle of philanthropy of philanthropy or of science to alleviate pain or to learn the whole truth about the human body come come now i cried you analyse too far i will not let even you put me out of conceit with sebastian her face flushed at that even you i almost fancied she began to like me he is the enthusiasm of my life just consider how much he has done for humanity she looked me through searchingly i will not destroy your illusion she answered after a pause it is a noble and generous one but is it not largely based on an ascetic face long white hair and a moustache that hides the cruel corners of the mouth for the corners are cruel some day i will show you them cut off the long hair shave the grizzled moustache nd what then will remain she drew a profile hastily just that and she showed it me was a face like robespierre grown harder and older and lined with observation i recognised that it was in fact the essence of sebastian next day as it turned out the professor himself insisted upon testing lethodyne in his own person all nat strove to dissuade him your life is so precious sir he advancement of science but the professor was adamantine science can only be advanced if men of science will take their lives in their hands he answered sternly besides nurse wade has tried am i to lag behind a woman in my devotion to the cause of physiological knowledge let him try hilda wade murmured to me he is quite right it will not hurt him i have told him already he has just the proper temperament to stand the drug such people are rare he is one of them we administered the dose trembling sebastian took it like a man and dropped off instantly for lethodyne is at least as instantaneous in its operation as nitrous oxide he lay long asleep hilda and i watched him after he had lain for some minutes senseless like a log on the couch where we had placed him hilda stooped over him quietly and lifted up the ends of the grizzled moustache then she pointed one accusing finger at his lips i told you so she murmured with a note of demonstration there is certainly something rather stern or even ruthless about the set of the face and the firm ending of the lips i admitted reluctantly that is why god gave men moustaches she mused in a low voice to hide the cruel corners of their mouths not always cruel i cried sometimes cruel sometimes cunning sometimes sensuous but nine times out of ten best masked by moustaches you have a bad opinion of our sex i exclaimed providence knew best she answered it gave you moustaches that was in order that we women might be spared from always seeing you as you are besides i said ine times out of ten there are exceptions uch exceptions on second thought i did not feel sure that i could quarrel with her estimate the experiment was that time once more successful sebastian woke up from the comatose state after eight hours not quite as fresh as hilda wade perhaps but still tolerably alive less alert however and complaining of dull headache he was not hungry hilda wade shook her head at that it will be of use only in a very few cases she said to me regretfully and those few will need to be carefully picked by an acute observer i see resistance to the coma is even more than i thought a matter of temperament why so impassioned a man as the professor himself cannot entirely recover with more sluggish temperaments we shall have deeper difficulty would you call him impassioned i asked most people think him so cold and stern she shook her head he is a snowapped volcano she answered the fires of his life burn bright below the exterior alone is cold and placid however starting from that time sebastian began a course of experiments on patients giving infinitesimal doses at first and venturing slowly on somewhat larger quantities but only in his own case and hilda could the result be called quite satisfactory one dull and heavy drinkodden navvy to whom he administered no more than oneenth of a grain was drowsy for a week and listless long after while a fat washerwoman from west ham who took only twoenths fell so fast asleep and snored so stertorously that we feared she was going to doze off into eternity after the fashion of the rabbits mothers of large families we noted stood the drug very ill on pale young girls of the consumptive tendency its effect was not marked but only a patient here and there of exceptionally imaginative and vivid temperament seemed able to endure it sebastian was discouraged he saw the anaesthetic was not destined to fulfil his first enthusiastic humanitarian expectations one day while the investigation was just at this stage a case was admitted into the observationots in which hilda wade took a particular interest the patient was a young girl named isabel huntley all dark and slender a markedly quick and imaginative type with large black eyes which clearly bespoke a passionate nature though distinctly hysterical she was pretty and pleasing her rich dark hair was as copious as it was beautiful she held herself erect and had a finely poised head from the first moment she arrived i could see nurse wade was strongly drawn towards her their souls sympathised number fourteen hat is our impersonal way of describing cases as constantly on hilda lips i like the girl she said once she is a lady in fibre and a tobaccorimmer by trade sebastian added sarcastically as usual hilda was the truer description it went deeper number fourteen ailment was a rare and peculiar one into which i need not enter here with professional precision i have described the case fully for my brother practitioners in my paper in the fourth volume of sebastian medical miscellanies it will be enough for my present purpose to say in brief that the lesion consisted of an internal growth which is always dangerous and most often fatal but which nevertheless is of such a character that if it be once happily eradicated by supremely good surgery it never tends to recur and leaves the patient as strong and well as ever sebastian was of course delighted with the splendid opportunity thus afforded him it is a beautiful case he cried with professional enthusiasm beautiful beautiful i never saw one so deadly or so malignant before we are indeed in luck way only a miracle can save her life cumberledge we must proceed to perform the miracle sebastian loved such cases they formed his ideal he did not greatly admire the artificial prolongation of diseased and unwholesome lives which could never be of much use to their owners or anyone else but when a chance occurred for restoring to perfect health a valuable existence which might otherwise be extinguished before its time he positively revelled in his beneficent calling what nobler object can a man propose to himself he used to say than to raise good men and true from the dead as it were and return them whole and sound to the family that depends upon them why i had fifty times rather cure an honest coaleaver of a wound in his leg than give ten years more lease of life to a gouty lord diseased from top to toe who expects to find a month of carlsbad or homburg once every year make up for eleven months of overating overrinking vulgar debauchery and underhinking he had no sympathy with men who lived the lives of swine his heart was with the workers of course hilda wade soon suggested that as an operation was absolutely necessary number fourteen would be a splendid subject on whom to test once more the effects of lethodyne sebastian with his head on one side surveying the patient promptly coincided nervous diathesis he observed very vivid fancy twitches her hands the right way quick pulse rapid perceptions no meaningless unrest but deep vitality i don doubt shel stand it we explained to number fourteen the gravity of the case and also the tentative character of the operation under lethodyne at first she shrank from taking it no no she said let me die quietly but hilda like the angel of mercy that she was whispered in the girl ear if it succeeds you will get quite well and ou can marry arthur the patient dark face flushed crimson ah arthur she cried dear arthur i can bear anything you choose to do to me or arthur how soon you find these things out i cried to hilda a few minutes later a mere man would never have thought of that and who is arthur a sailor n a ship that trades with the south seas i hope he is worthy of her fretting over arthur absence has aggravated the case he is homewardound now she is worrying herself to death for fear she should not live to say goodye to him she will live to marry him i answered with confidence like her own if you say she can stand it the lethodyne h yes that all right but the operation itself is so extremely dangerous though dr sebastian says he has called in the best surgeon in london for all such cases they are rare he tells me nd nielsen has performed on six three of them successfully we gave the girl the drug she took it trembling and went off at once holding hilda hand with a pale smile on her face which persisted there somewhat weirdly all through the operation the work of removing the growth was long and ghastly even for us who were well seasoned to such sights but at the end nielsen expressed himself as perfectly satisfied a very neat piece of work sebastian exclaimed looking on i congratulate you nielsen i never saw anything done cleaner or better a successful operation certainly the great surgeon admitted with just pride in the master commendation and the patient hilda asked wavering oh the patient the patient will die nielsen replied in an unconcerned voice wiping his spotless instruments that is not my idea of the medical art i cried shocked at his callousness an operation is only successful if he regarded me with lofty scorn a certain percentage of losses he interrupted calmly is inevitable of course in all surgical operations we are obliged to average it how could i preserve my precision and accuracy of hand if i were always bothered by sentimental considerations of the patient safety hilda wade looked up at me with a sympathetic glance we will pull her through yet she murmured in her soft voice if care and skill can do it y care and your skill this is now our patient dr cumberledge it needed care and skill we watched her for hours and she showed no sign or gleam of recovery her sleep was deeper than either sebastian or hilda had been she had taken a big dose so as to secure immobility the question now was would she recover at all from it hour after hour we waited and watched and not a sign of movement only the same deep slow hampered breathing the same feeble jerky pulse the same deathly pallor on the dark cheeks the same corpseike rigidity of limb and muscle at last our patient stirred faintly as in a dream her breath faltered we bent over her was it death or was she beginning to recover very slowly a faint trace of colour came back to her cheeks her heavy eyes half opened they stared first with a white stare her arms dropped by her side her mouth relaxed its ghastly smile we held our breath she was coming to again but her coming to was slow ery very slow her pulse was still weak her heart pumped feebly we feared she might sink from inanition at any moment hilda wade knelt on the floor by the girl side and held a spoonful of beef essence coaxingly to her lips number fourteen gasped drew a long slow breath then gulped and swallowed it after that she lay back with her mouth open looking like a corpse hilda pressed another spoonful of the soft jelly upon her but the girl waved it away with one trembling hand let me die she cried let me die i feel dead already hilda held her face close isabel she whispered nd i recognised in her tone the vast moral difference between isabel and number fourteen isel you must take it for arthur sake i say you must take it the girl hand quivered as it lay on the white coverlet for arthur sake she murmured lifting her eyelids dreamily for arthur sake yes nurse dear call me hilda please hilda the girl face lighted up again yes hilda dear she answered in an unearthly voice like one raised from the dead i will call you what you will angel of light you have been so good to me she opened her lips with an effort and slowly swallowed another spoonful then she fell back exhausted but her pulse improved within twenty minutes i mentioned the matter with enthusiasm to sebastian later it is very nice in its way he answered but it is not nursing i thought to myself that that was just what it was but i did not say so sebastian was a man who thought meanly of women a doctor like a priest he used to declare should keep himself unmarried his bride is medicine and he disliked to see what he called philandering going on in his hospital it may have been on that account that i avoided speaking much of hilda wade thenceforth before him he looked in casually next day to see the patient she will die he said with perfect assurance as we passed down the ward together operation has taken too much out of her still she has great recuperative powers hilda answered they all have in her family professor you may perhaps remember joseph huntley who occupied number sixtyeven in the accident ward some nine months since ompound fracture of the arm dark nervous engineer assistant ery hard to restrain ell he was her brother he caught typhoid fever in the hospital and you commented at the time on his strange vitality then there was her cousin again ellen stubbs we had her for stubborn chronic laryngitis very bad case nyone else would have died ielded at once to your treatment and made i recollect a splendid convalescence what a memory you have sebastian cried admiring against his will it is simply marvellous i never saw anyone like you in my life except once he was a man a doctor a colleague of mine ead long ago why he mused and gazed hard at her hilda shrank before his gaze this is curious he went on slowly at last very curious you hy you resemble him do i hilda replied with forced calm raising her eyes to his their glances met that moment i saw each had recognised something and from that day forth i was instinctively aware that a duel was being waged between sebastian and hilda duel between the two ablest and most singular personalities i had ever met a duel of life and death hough i did not fully understand its purport till much much later every day after that the poor wasted girl in number fourteen grew feebler and fainter her temperature rose her heart throbbed weakly she seemed to be fading away sebastian shook his head lethodyne is a failure he said with a mournful regret one cannot trust it the case might have recovered from the operation or recovered from the drug but she could not recover from both together yet the operation would have been impossible without the drug and the drug is useless except for the operation it was a great disappointment to him he hid himself in his room as was his wont when disappointed and went on with his old work at his beloved microbes i have one hope still hilda murmured to me by the bedside when our patient was at her worst if one contingency occurs i believe we may save her what is that i asked she shook her head waywardly you must wait and see she answered if it comes off i will tell you if not let it swell the limbo of lost inspirations next morning early however she came up to me with a radiant face holding a newspaper in her hand well it has happened she cried rejoicing we shall save poor isabel number fourteen i mean our way is clear dr cumberledge i followed her blindly to the bedside little guessing what she could mean she knelt down at the head of the cot the girl eyes were closed i touched her cheek she was in a high fever temperature i asked a hundred and three i shook my head every symptom of fatal relapse i could not imagine what card hilda held in reserve but i stood there waiting she whispered in the girl ear arthur ship is sighted off the lizard the patient opened her eyes slowly and rolled them for a moment as if she did not understand too late i cried too late she is delirious nsensible hilda repeated the words slowly but very distinctly do you hear dear arthur ship it is sighted arthur ship at the lizard the girl lips moved arthur arthur arthur ship a deep sigh she clenched her hands he is coming hilda nodded and smiled holding her breath with suspense up the channel now he will be at southampton tonight arthur at southampton it is here in the papers i have telegraphed to him to hurry on at once to see you she struggled up for a second a smile flitted across the worn face then she fell back wearily i thought all was over her eyes stared white but ten minutes later she opened her lids again arthur is coming she murmured arthur coming yes dear now sleep he is coming all through that day and the next night she was restless and agitated but still her pulse improved a little next morning she was again a trifle better temperature falling hundred and one point three at ten olock hilda came in to her radiant well isabel dear she cried bending down and touching her cheek kissing is forbidden by the rules of the hous arthur has come he is here down below i have seen him seen him the girl gasped yes seen him talked with him such a nice manly fellow and such an honest good face he is longing for you to get well he says he has come home this time to marry you the wan lips quivered he will never marry me yes yes he will f you will take this jelly look here e wrote these words to you before my very eyes ear love to my isa if you are good and will sleep he may see you the girl opened her lips and ate the jelly greedily she ate as much as she was desired in three minutes more her head had fallen like a child upon her pillow and she was sleeping peacefully i went up to sebastian room quite excited with the news he was busy among his bacilli they were his hobby his pets well what do you think professor i cried that patient of nurse wade he gazed up at me abstractedly his brow contracting yes yes i know he interrupted the girl in fourteen i have discounted her case long ago she has ceased to interest me dead of course nothing else was possible i laughed a quick little laugh of triumph no sir not dead recovering she has fallen just now into a normal sleep her breathing is natural he wheeled his revolving chair away from the germs and fixed me with his keen eyes recovering he echoed impossible rallying you mean a mere flicker i know my trade she must die this evening forgive my persistence i replied but er temperature has gone down to ninetyine and a trifle he pushed away the bacilli in the nearest watchlass quite angrily to ninetyine he exclaimed knitting his brows cumberledge this is disgraceful a most disappointing case a most provoking patient but surely sir i cried don talk to me boy don attempt to apologise for her such conduct is unpardonable she ought to have died it was her clear duty i said she would die and she should have known better than to fly in the face of the faculty her recovery is an insult to medical science what is the staff about nurse wade should have prevented it still sir i exclaimed trying to touch him on a tender spot the anaesthetic you know such a triumph for lethodyne this case shows clearly that on certain constitutions it may be used with advantage under certain conditions he snapped his fingers lethodyne pooh i have lost interest in it impracticable it is not fitted for the human species why so number fourteen proves he interrupted me with an impatient wave of his hand then he rose and paced up and down the room testily after a pause he spoke again the weak point of lethodyne is this nobody can be trusted to say when it may be used xcept nurse wade hich is not science for the first time in my life i had a glimmering idea that i distrusted sebastian hilda wade was right he man was cruel but i had never observed his cruelty before ecause his devotion to science had blinded me to it chapter the episode of the gentleman who had failed for everything one day about those times i went round to call on my aunt lady tepping and lest you accuse me of the vulgar desire to flaunt my fine relations in your face i hasten to add that my poor dear old aunt is a very ordinary specimen of the common army widow her husband sir malcolm a crusty old gentleman of the ancient school was knighted in burma or thereabouts for a successful raid upon naked natives on something that is called the shan frontier when he had grown grey in the service of his queen and country besides earning himself incidentally a very decent pension he acquired gout and went to his long rest in kensal green cemetery he left his wife with one daughter and the only pretence to a title in our otherwise blameless family my cousin daphne is a very pretty girl with those quiet sedate manners which often develop later in life into genuine selfespect and real depth of character fools do not admire her they accuse her of being heavy but she can do without fools she has a fine strongly built figure an upright carriage a large and broad forehead a firm chin and features which though wellarked and welloulded are yet delicate in outline and sensitive in expression very young men seldom take to daphne she lacks the desired inanity but she has mind repose and womanly tenderness indeed if she had not been my cousin i almost think i might once have been tempted to fall in love with her when i reached gloucester terrace on this particular afternoon i found hilda wade there before me she had lunched at my aunt in fact it was her day out at st nathaniel and she had come round to spend it with daphne tepping i had introduced her to the house some time before and she and my cousin had struck up a close acquaintance immediately their temperaments were sympathetic daphne admired hilda depth and reserve while hilda admired daphne grave grace and selfontrol her perfect freedom from current affectations she neither giggled nor aped ibsenism a third person stood back in the room when i entered tall and somewhat jerryuilt young man with a rather long and solemn face like an early stage in the evolution of a don quixote i took a good look at him there was something about his air that impressed me as both lugubrious and humorous and in this i was right for i learned later that he was one of those rare people who can sing a comic song with immense success while preserving a sour countenance like a puritan preacher his eyes were a little sunken his fingers long and nervous but i fancied he looked a good fellow at heart for all that though foolishly impulsive he was a punctilious gentleman i felt sure his face and manner grew upon one rapidly daphne rose as i entered and waved the stranger forward with an imperious little wave i imagined indeed that i detected in the gesture a faint touch of halfnconscious proprietorship goodorning hubert she said taking my hand but turning towards the tall young man i don think you know mr cecil holsworthy i have heard you speak of him i answered drinking him in with my glance i added internally not half good enough for you hilda eyes met mine and read my thought they flashed back word in the language of eyes i do not agree with you daphne meanwhile was watching me closely i could see she was anxious to discover what impression her friend mr holsworthy was making on me till then i had no idea she was fond of anyone in particular but the way her glance wandered from him to me and from me to hilda showed clearly that she thought much of this gawky visitor we sat and talked together we four for some time i found the young man with the lugubrious countenance improved immensely on closer acquaintance his talk was clever he turned out to be the son of a politician high in office in the canadian government and he had been educated at oxford the father i gathered was rich but he himself was making an income of nothing a year just then as a briefless barrister and he was hesitating whether to accept a post of secretary that had been offered him in the colony or to continue his negative career at the inner temple for the honour and glory of it now which would you advise me miss tepping he inquired after we had discussed the matter some minutes daphne face flushed up it is so hard to decide she answered to decide to your best advantage i mean of course for naturally all your english friends would wish to keep you as long as possible in england no do you think so the gawky young man jerked out with evident pleasure now that awfully kind of you do you know if you tell me i ought to stay in england ie half a mind il cable over this very day and refuse the appointment daphne flushed once more oh please don she exclaimed looking frightened i shall be quite distressed if a stray word of mine should debar you from accepting a good offer of a secretaryship why your least wish the young man began hen checked himself hastily must be always important he went on in a different voice to everyone of your acquaintance daphne rose hurriedly look here hilda she said a little tremulously biting her lip i have to go out into westbourne grove to get those gloves for toight and a spray for my hair will you excuse me for half an hour holsworthy rose too mayn i go with you he asked eagerly oh if you like how very kind of you daphne answered her cheek a blush rose hubert will you come too and you hilda it was one of those invitations which are given to be refused i did not need hilda warning glance to tell me that my company would be quite superfluous i felt those two were best left together it no use though dr cumberledge hilda put in as soon as they were gone he won propose though he has had every encouragement i don know what the matter but ie been watching them both for weeks and somehow things seem never to get any forwarder you think he in love with her i asked in love with her well you have eyes in your head i know where could they have been looking he madly in love very good kind of love too he genuinely admires and respects and appreciates all daphne sweet and charming qualities then what do you suppose is the matter i have an inkling of the truth i imagine mr cecil must have let himself in for a prior attachment if so why does he hang about daphne because e can help himself he a good fellow and a chivalrous fellow he admires your cousin but he must have got himself into some foolish entanglement elsewhere which he is too honourable to break off while at the same time he far too much impressed by daphne fine qualities to be able to keep away from her it the ordinary case of love versus duty is he well off could he afford to marry daphne oh his father very rich he has plenty of money a canadian millionaire they say that makes it all the likelier that some undesirable young woman somewhere may have managed to get hold of him just the sort of romantic impressionable hobbledehoy such women angle for i drummed my fingers on the table presently hilda spoke again why don you try to get to know him and find out precisely what the matter i know what the matter ow youe told me i answered it as clear as day daphne is very much smitten with him too i sorry for daphne well il take your advice il try to have some talk with him do please i feel sure i have hit upon it he has got himself engaged in a hurry to some girl he doesn really care about and he is far too much of a gentleman to break it off though he in love quite another way with daphne just at that moment the door opened and my aunt entered why where daphne she cried looking about her and arranging her black lace shawl she has just run out into westbourne grove to get some gloves and a flower for the fete this evening hilda answered then she added significantly mr holsworthy has gone with her what that boy been here again yes lady tepping he called to see daphne my aunt turned to me with an aggrieved tone it is a peculiarity of my aunt have met it elsewhere hat if she is angry with jones and jones is not present she assumes a tone of injured asperity on his account towards brown or smith or any other innocent person whom she happens to be addressing now this is really too bad hubert she burst out as if i were the culprit disgraceful abominable i sure i can make out what the young fellow means by it here he comes dangling after daphne every day and all day long nd never once says whether he means anything by it or not in my young days such conduct as that would not have been considered respectable i nodded and beamed benignly well why don you answer me my aunt went on warming up do you mean to tell me you think his behaviour respectful to a nice girl in daphne position my dear aunt i answered you confound the persons i am not mr holsworthy i decline responsibility for him i meet him here in your house for the first time this morning then that shows how often you come to see your relations hubert my aunt burst out obliquely the man been here to my certain knowledge every day this six weeks really aunt fanny i said you must recollect that a professional man oh yes that the way lay it all down to your profession do hubert though i know you were at the thorntons on saturday aw it in the papers he morning post mong the guests were sir edward and lady burnes professor sebastian dr hubert cumberledge and so forth and so forth you think you can conceal these things but you can i get to know them conceal them my dearest aunt why i danced twice with daphne daphne yes daphne they all run after daphne my aunt exclaimed altering the venue once more but there no respect for age left i expect to be neglected however that neither here nor there the point is this youe the one man now living in the family you ought to behave like a brother to daphne why don you board this holsworthy person and ask him his intentions goodness gracious i cried most excellent of aunts that epoch has gone past the late lamented queen anne is now dead it no use asking the young man of toay to explain his intentions he will refer you to the works of the scandinavian dramatists my aunt was speechless she could only gurgle out the words well i can safely say that of all the monstrous behaviour then language failed her and she relapsed into silence however when daphne and young holsworthy returned i had as much talk with him as i could and when he left the house i left also which way are you walking i asked as we turned out into the street towards my rooms in the temple oh i going back to st nathaniel i continued if youl allow me il walk part way with you how very kind of you we strode side by side a little distance in silence then a thought seemed to strike the lugubrious young man what a charming girl your cousin is he exclaimed abruptly you seem to think so i answered smiling he flushed a little the lantern jaw grew longer i admire her of course he answered who doesn she is so extraordinarily handsome well not exactly handsome i replied with more critical and kinsmanike deliberation pretty if you will and decidedly pleasing and attractive in manner he looked me up and down as if he found me a person singularly deficient in taste and appreciation ah but then you are her cousin he said at last with a compassionate tone that makes a difference i quite see all daphne strong points i answered still smiling for i could perceive he was very far gone she is goodooking and she is clever clever he echoed profound she has a most unusual intellect she stands alone like her mother silk dresses i murmured half under my breath he took no notice of my flippant remark but went on with his rhapsody such depth such penetration and then how sympathetic why even to a mere casual acquaintance like myself she is so kind so discerning are you such a casual acquaintance i inquired with a smile it might have shocked aunt fanny to hear me but that is the way we ask a young man his intentions nowadays he stopped short and hesitated oh quite casual he replied almost stammering most casual i assure you i have never ventured to do myself the honour of supposing that that miss tepping could possibly care for me there is such a thing as being too modest and unassuming i answered it sometimes leads to unintentional cruelty no do you think so he cried his face falling all at once i should blame myself bitterly if that were so dr cumberledge you are her cousin do you gather that i have acted in such a way as to o lead miss tepping to suppose i felt any affection for her i laughed in his face my dear boy i answered laying one hand on his shoulder may i say the plain truth a blind bat could see you are madly in love with her his mouth twitched that very serious he answered gravely very serious it is i responded with my best paternal manner gazing blankly in front of me he stopped short again look here he said facing me are you busy no then come back with me to my rooms and make a clean breast of it by all means i assented when one is young nd foolish have often noticed as a medical man that a drachm of clean breast is a magnificent prescription he walked back by my side talking all the way of daphne many adorable qualities he exhausted the dictionary for laudatory adjectives by the time i reached his door it was not his fault if i had not learned that the angelic hierarchy were not in the running with my pretty cousin for graces and virtues i felt that faith hope and charity ought to resign at once in favour of miss daphne tepping promoted he took me into his comfortably furnished rooms he luxurious rooms of a rich young bachelor with taste as well as money nd offered me a partaga now i have long observed in the course of my practice that a choice cigar assists a man in taking a philosophic outlook on the question under discussion so i accepted the partaga he sat down opposite me and pointed to a photograph in the centre of his mantlepiece i am engaged to that lady he put in shortly so i anticipated i answered lighting up he started and looked surprised why what made you guess it he inquired i smiled the calm smile of superior age was some eight years or so his senior my dear fellow i murmured what else could prevent you from proposing to daphne hen you are so undeniably in love with her a great deal he answered for example the sense of my own utter unworthiness one own unworthiness i replied though doubtless real p s a barrier that most of us can readily get over when our admiration for a particular lady waxes strong enough so this is the prior attachment i took the portrait down and scanned it unfortunately yes what do you think of her i scrutinised the features seems a nice enough little thing i answered it was an innocent face i admit very frank and girlish he leaned forward eagerly that just it a nice enough little thing nothing in the world to be said against her while daphne iss tepping i mean his silence was ecstatic i examined the photograph still more closely it displayed a lady of twenty or thereabouts with a weak face small vacant features a feeble chin a goodumoured simple mouth and a wealth of golden hair that seemed to strike a keynote in the theatrical profession i inquired at last looking up he hesitated well not exactly he answered i pursed my lips and blew a ring musicall stage i went on dubiously he nodded but a girl is not necessarily any the less a lady because she sings at a musicall he added with warmth displaying an evident desire to be just to his betrothed however much he admired daphne certainly not i admitted a lady is a lady no occupation can in itself unladify her but on the musicall stage the odds one must admit are on the whole against her now there you show prejudice one may be quite unprejudiced i answered and yet allow that connection with the musicalls does not as such afford clear proof that a girl is a compound of all the virtues i think she a good girl he retorted slowly then why do you want to throw her over i inquired i don that just it on the contrary i mean to keep my word and marry her in order to keep your word i suggested he nodded precisely it is a point of honour that a poor ground of marriage i went on mind i don want for a moment to influence you as daphne cousin i want to get at the truth of the situation i don even know what daphne thinks of you but you promised me a clean breast be a man and bare it he bared it instantly i thought i was in love with this girl you see he went on till i saw miss tepping that makes a difference i admitted and i couldn bear to break her heart heaven forbid i cried it is the one unpardonable sin better anything than that then i grew practical father consent my father is it likely he expects me to marry into some distinguished english family i hummed a moment well out with it i exclaimed pointing my cigar at him he leaned back in his chair and told me the whole story a pretty girl golden hair introduced to her by a friend nice simple little thing mind and heart above the irregular stage on to which she had been driven by poverty alone father dead mother in reduced circumstances to keep the home together poor sissie decided precisely so i murmured knocking off my ash the usual selfacrifice case quite normal everything en regle you don mean to say you doubt it he cried flushing up and evidently regarding me as a hopeless cynic i do assure you dr cumberledge the poor child hough miles of course below miss tepping level s as innocent and as good as a flower in may oh yes i don doubt it how did you come to propose to her though he reddened a little well it was almost accidental he said sheepishly i called there one evening and her mother had a headache and went up to bed and when we two were left alone sissie talked a great deal about her future and how hard her life was and after a while she broke down and began to cry and then i cut him short with a wave of my hand you need say no more i put in with a sympathetic face we have all been there we paused a moment while i puffed smoke at the photograph again well i said at last her face looks to me really simple and nice it is a good face do you see her often oh no she on tour in the provinces mes just at present at scarborough but she writes to you every day would you think it an unpardonable impertinence if i made bold to ask whether it would be possible for you to show me a specimen of her letters he unlocked a drawer and took out three or four then he read one through carefully i don think he said in a deliberative voice it would be a serious breach of confidence in me to let you look through this one there really nothing in it you know ust the ordinary average everyay loveetter i glanced through the little note he was right the conventional hearts and darts epistle it sounded nice enough longing to see you again so lonely in this place your dear sweet letter looking forward to the time your everevoted sissie that seems straight i answered however i am not quite sure will you allow me to take it away with the photograph i know i am asking much i want to show it to a lady in whose tact and discrimination i have the greatest confidence what daphne i smiled no not daphne i answered our friend miss wade she has extraordinary insight i could trust anything to miss wade she is true as steel you are right i answered that shows that you too are a judge of character he hesitated i feel a brute he cried to go on writing every day to sissie montague nd yet calling every day to see miss tepping but still do it i grasped his hand my dear fellow i said nearly ninety per cent of men after all re human i took both letter and photograph back with me to nathaniel when i had gone my rounds that night i carried them into hilda wade room and told her the story her face grew grave we must be just she said at last daphne is deeply in love with him but even for daphne sake we must not take anything for granted against the other lady i produced the photograph what do you make of that i asked i think it an honest face myself i may tell you she scrutinised it long and closely with a magnifier then she put her head on one side and mused very deliberately madeline shaw gave me her photograph the other day and said to me as she gave it do so like these modern portraits they show one what might have been you mean they are so much touched up exactly that as it stands is a sweet innocent face n honest girl face lmost babyish in its transparency but the innocence has all been put into it by the photographer you think so i know it look here at those lines just visible on the cheek they disappear nowhere at impossible angles and the corners of that mouth they couldn go so with that nose and those puckers the thing is not real it has been atrociously edited part is nature part the photographer part even possibly paint and powder but the underlying face is a minx i handed her the letter this next i asked fixing my eyes on her as she looked she read it through for a minute or two she examined it the letter is right enough she answered after a second reading though its guileless simplicity is perhaps under the circumstances just a leetle overdone but the handwriting he handwriting is duplicity itself a cunning serpentine hand no openness or honesty in it depend upon it that girl is playing a double game you believe then there is character in handwriting undoubtedly when we know the character we can see it in the writing the difficulty is to see it and read it before we know it and i have practised a little at that there is character in all we do of course ur walk our cough the very wave of our hands the only secret is not all of us have always skill to see it here however i feel pretty sure the curls of the g and the tails of the y ow full they are of wile of low underhand trickery i looked at them as she pointed that is true i exclaimed i see it when you show it lines meant for effect no straightness or directness in them hilda reflected a moment poor daphne she murmured i would do anything to help her il tell what might be a good plan her face brightened my holiday comes next week il run down to scarborough t as nice a place for a holiday as any nd il observe this young lady it can do no harm nd good may come of it how kind of you i cried but you are always all kindness hilda went to scarborough and came back again for a week before going on to bruges where she proposed to spend the greater part of her holidays she stopped a night or two in town to report progress and finding another nurse ill promised to fill her place till a substitute was forthcoming well dr cumberledge she said when she saw me alone i was right i have found out a fact or two about daphne rival you have seen her i asked seen her i have stopped for a week in the same house a very nice lodgingouse on the spa front too the girl well enough off the poverty plea fails she goes about in good rooms and carries a mother with her that well i answered that looks all right oh yes she quite presentable has the manners of a lady whenever she chooses but the chief point is this she laid her letters every day on the table in the passage outside her door for post aid them all in a row so that when one claimed one own one couldn help seeing them well that was open and aboveboard i continued beginning to fear we had hastily misjudged miss sissie montague very open much so in fact for i was obliged to note the fact that she wrote two letters regularly every day of her life o my two mashes she explained one afternoon to a young man who was with her as she laid them on the table one of them was always addressed to cecil holsworthy esq and the other wasn did you note the name i asked interested yes here it is she handed me a slip of paper i read it reginald nettlecraft esq staples inn london what reggie nettlecraft i cried amused why he was a very little boy at charterhouse when i was a big one he afterwards went to oxford and got sent down from christ church for the part he took in burning a greek bust in tom quad n antique greek bust fter a bump supper just the sort of man i should have expected hilda answered with a suppressed smile i have a sort of inkling that miss montague likes him best he is nearer her type but she thinks cecil holsworthy the better match has mr nettlecraft money not a penny i should say an allowance from his father perhaps who is a lincolnshire parson but otherwise nothing then in my opinion the young lady is playing for mr holsworthy money failing which she will decline upon mr nettlecraft heart we talked it all over in the end i said abruptly nurse wade you have seen miss montague or whatever she calls herself i have not i won condemn her unheard i have half a mind to run down one day next week to scarborough and have a look at her do that will suffice you can judge then for yourself whether or not i am mistaken i went and what is more i heard miss sissie sing at her hall pretty domestic song most childish and charming she impressed me not unfavourably in spite of what hilda said her peachlossom cheek might have been art but looked like nature she had an open face a baby smile and there was a frank girlishness about her dress and manner that took my fancy after all i thought to myself even hilda wade is fallible so that evening when her turn was over i made up my mind to go round and call upon her i had told cecil holsworthy my intentions beforehand and it rather shocked him he was too much of a gentleman to wish to spy upon the girl he had promised to marry however in my case there need be no such scruples i found the house and asked for miss montague as i mounted the stairs to the drawingoom floor i heard a sound of voices he murmur of laughter idiotic guffaws suppressed giggles the masculine and feminine varieties of tomfoolery you make a splendid woman of business you would a young man was saying i gathered from his drawl that he belonged to that subpecies of the human race which is known as the chappie wouldn i just a girl voice answered tittering i recognised it as sissie you ought to see me at it why my brother set up a place once for mending bicycles and i used to stand about at the door as if i had just returned from a ride and when fellows came in with a nut loose or something i begin talking with them while bertie tightened it then when they weren looking i dab the business end of a darningeedle so just plump into their tires and of course as soon as they went off they were back again in a minute to get a puncture mended i call that business a roar of laughter greeted the recital of this brilliant incident in a commercial career as it subsided i entered there were two men in the room besides miss montague and her mother and a second young lady excuse this late call i said quietly bowing but i have only one night in scarborough miss montague and i wanted to see you i a friend of mr holsworthy i told him i look you up and this is my sole opportunity i felt rather than saw that miss montague darted a quick glance of hidden meaning at her friends the chappies their faces in response ceased to snigger and grew instantly sober she took my card then in her alternative manner as the perfect lady she presented me to her mother dr cumberledge mamma she said in a faintly warning voice a friend of mr holsworthy the old lady half rose let me see she said staring at me which is mr holsworthy siss s it cecil or reggie one of the chappies burst into a fatuous laugh once more at this remark now youe giving away the whole show mrs montague he exclaimed with a chuckle a look from miss sissie immediately checked him i am bound to admit however that after these untoward incidents of the first minute miss montague and her friends behaved throughout with distinguished propriety her manners were perfect may even say demure she asked about cecil with charming naivete she was frank and girlish lots of innocent fun in her no doubt he sang us a comic song in excellent taste which is a severe test ut not a suspicion of doubleealing if i had not overheard those few words as i came up the stairs i think i should have gone away believing the poor girl an injured child of nature as it was i went back to london the very next day determined to renew my slight acquaintance with reggie nettlecraft fortunately i had a good excuse for going to visit him i had been asked to collect among old carthusians for one of those endless testimonials which pursue one through life and are perhaps the worst nemesis which follows the crime of having wasted one youth at a public school a testimonial for a retiring master or professional cricketer or washerwoman or something and in the course of my duties as collector it was quite natural that i should call upon all my fellowictims so i went to his rooms in staples inn and reintroduced myself reggie nettlecraft had grown up into an unwholesome spotty indeterminate young man with a speckled necktie and cuffs of which he was inordinately proud and which he insisted on flashing every second minute he was also evidently selfatisfied which was odd for i have seldom seen anyone who afforded less cause for rational satisfaction hullo he said when i told him my name so it you is it cumberledge he glanced at my card st nathaniel hospital what rot why blow me tight if you haven turned sawbones that is my profession i answered unashamed and you oh i don have any luck you know old man they turned me out of oxford because i had too much sense of humour for the authorities there eastly set of old fogeys objected to my hucking oyster shells at the tutors windows old english custom fast becoming obsolete then i crammed for the army but bless your heart a gentleman has no chance for the army nowadays a pack of blooming cads with what they call ntellect read up for the exams and don give us a lookn i call it sheer piffle then the guvor set me on electrical engineering lectrical engineering played out i put no stock in it besides it such beastly fag and then you get your hands dirty so now i reading for the bar and if only my coach can put me up to tips enough to dodge the examiners i expect to be called some time next summer and when you have failed for everything i inquired just to test his sense of humour he swallowed it like a roach oh when ie failed for everything i shall stick up to the guvor hang it all a gentleman can be expected to earn his own livelihood england going to the dogs that where it is no snug little sinecures left for chaps like you and me all this beastly competition and no respect for the feelings of gentlemen either why would you believe it cumberground e used to call you cumberground at charterhouse i remember or was it fig tree happened to get a bit lively in the haymarket last week after a rattling good supper and the chap at the police court ld cove with a squint ositively proposed to send me to prison without the option of a fine trouble you for that end me to prison just or knocking down a common brute of a bobby there no mistake about it england not a country now for a gentleman to live in then why not mark your sense of the fact by leaving it i inquired with a smile he shook his head what emigrate no thank you i not taking any none of your colonies for me if you please i shall stick to the old ship i too much attached to the empire and yet imperialists i said generally gush over the colonies he empire on which the sun never sets the empire in leicester squire he responded gazing at me with unspoken contempt have a whiskyndoda old chap what no ever drink between meals well you do surprise me i suppose that comes of being a sawbones don it possibly i answered we respect our livers then i went on to the ostensible reason of my visit he charterhouse testimonial he slapped his thighs metaphorically by way of suggesting the depleted condition of his pockets stony broke cumberledge he murmured stony broke honour bright unless bluebird pulls off the prince of wales stakes i really don know how i to pay the benchers it quite unimportant i answered i was asked to ask you and i have asked you so i twig my dear fellow sorry to have to say no but il tell you what i can do for you i can put you upon a straight thing i glanced at the mantelpiece i see you have a photograph of miss sissie montague i broke in casually taking it down and examining it with an autograph too eggie from sissie you are a friend of hers a friend of hers il trouble you she is a clinker sissie is you should see that girl smoke i give you my word of honour cumberledge she can consume cigarettes against any fellow i know in london hang it all a girl like that you know ell one can help admiring her ever seen her oh yes i know her i called on her in fact night before last at scarborough he whistled a moment then broke into an imbecile laugh my gum he cried this is a start this is you don mean to tell me you are the other johnnie what other johnnie i asked feeling we were getting near it he leaned back and laughed again well you know that girl sissie she a clever one she is he went on after a minute staring at me she a regular clinker got two strings to her bow that where the trouble comes in me and another fellow she likes me for love and the other fellow for money now don you come and tell me that you are the other fellow i have certainly never aspired to the young lady hand i answered cautiously but don you know your rival name then that sissie blooming cleverness she a caulker sissie is you don take a rise out of sissie in a hurry she knows that if i knew who the other bloke was i blow upon her little game to him and put him off her and i would sp me taters for i nuts on that girl i tell you cumberledge she is a clinker you seem to me admirably adapted for one another i answered truthfully i had not the slightest compunction in handing reggie nettlecraft over to sissie nor in handing sissie over to reggie nettlecraft adapted for one another that just it there you hit the right nail plump on the cocoanut cumberground but sissie an artful one she is she playing for the other johnnie he got the dibs you know and sissie wants the dibs even more than she wants yours truly got what i inquired not quite catching the phrase the dibs old man the chink the the ready rhino he rolls in it she says i can find out the chap name but i know his guvor something or other in the millionaire trade somewhere across in america she writes to you i think that so every blooming day but how the dummy did you come to know it she lays letters addressed to you on the hall table at her lodgings in scarborough the dickens she does careless little beggar yes she writes to me ages she awfully gone on me really she marry me if it wasn for the johnnie with the dibs she doesn care for him she wants his money he dresses badly don you see and after all the clothes make the man i like to get at him i spoil his pretty face for him and he assumed a playfully pugilistic attitude you really want to get rid of this other fellow i asked seeing my chance get rid of him why of course chuck him into the river some nice dark night if i could once get a look at him as a preliminary step would you mind letting me see one of miss montague letters i inquired he drew a long breath theye a bit affectionate you know he murmured stroking his beardless chin in hesitation she a hot n sissie is she pitches it pretty warm on the affectiontop i can tell you but if you really think you can give the other johnnie a cut on the head with her letters ell in the interests of true love which never does run smooth i don mind letting you have a squint as my friend at one of her charming billyoos he took a bundle from a drawer ran his eye over one or two with a maudlin air and then selected a specimen not wholly unsuitable for publication there one in the eye for he said chuckling what would say to that i wonder she always calls him you know it so jolly nonommitting she says only wish that beastly old bore were at halifax hich is where he comes from and then i would fly at once to my own dear reggie but hang it all reggie boy what the good of true love if you haven got the dibs i must have my comforts love in a cottage is all very well in its way but who to pay for the fizz reggie that her refinement don you see sissie awfully refined she was brought up with the tastes and habits of a lady clearly so i answered both her literary style and her liking for champagne abundantly demonstrate it his acute sense of humour did not enable him to detect the irony of my observation i doubt if it extended much beyond oyster shells he handed me the letter i read it through with equal amusement and gratification if miss sissie had written it on purpose in order to open cecil holsworthy eyes she couldn have managed the matter better or more effectually it breathed ardent love tempered by a determination to sell her charms in the best and highest matrimonial market now i know this man i said when i had finished and i want to ask whether you will let me show him miss montague letter it would set him against the girl who as a matter of fact is wholly unwor mean totally unfitted for him let you show it to him like a bird why sissie promised me herself that if she couldn bring hat solemn ass up to the scratch by christmas she chuck him and marry me it here in writing and he handed me another gem of epistolary literature you have no compunctions i asked again after reading it not a blessed compunction to my name then neither have i i answered i felt they both deserved it sissie was a minx as hilda rightly judged while as for nettlecraft ell if a public school and an english university leave a man a cad a cad he will be and there is nothing more to be said about it i went straight off with the letters to cecil holsworthy he read them through half incredulously at first he was too honestatured himself to believe in the possibility of such doubleealing hat one could have innocent eyes and golden hair and yet be a trickster he read them twice then he compared them word for word with the simple affection and childlike tone of his own last letter received from the same lady her versatility of style would have done honour to a practised literary craftsman at last he handed them back to me do you think he said on the evidence of these i should be doing wrong in breaking with her wrong in breaking with her i exclaimed you would be doing wrong if you didn rong to yourself wrong to your family wrong if i may venture to say so to daphne wrong even in the long run to the girl herself for she is not fitted for you and she is fitted for reggie nettlecraft now do as i bid you sit down at once and write her a letter from my dictation he sat down and wrote much relieved that i took the responsibility off his shoulders dear miss montague i began the inclosed letters have come into my hands without my seeking it after reading them i feel that i have absolutely no right to stand between you and the man of your real choice it would not be kind or wise of me to do so i release you at once and consider myself released you may therefore regard our engagement as irrevocably cancelled faithfully yours cecil holsworthy nothing more than that he asked looking up and biting his pen not a word of regret or apology not a word i answered you are really too lenient i made him take it out and post it before he could invent conscientious scruples then he turned to me irresolutely what shall i do next he asked with a comical air of doubt i smiled my dear fellow that is a matter for your own consideration but o you think she will laugh at me miss montague no daphne i am not in not in daphne confidence i answered i don know how she feels but on the face of it i think i can venture to assure you that at least she won laugh at you he grasped my hand hard you don mean to say so he cried well that really very kind of her a girl of daphne high type and i who feel myself so utterly unworthy of her we are all unworthy of a good woman love i answered but thank heaven the good women don seem to realise it that evening about ten my new friend came back in a hurry to my rooms at st nathaniel nurse wade was standing there giving her report for the night when he entered his face looked some inches shorter and broader than usual his eyes beamed his mouth was radiant well you won believe it dr cumberledge he began but yes i do believe it i answered i know it i have read it already read it he cried where i waved my hand towards his face in a special edition of the evening papers i answered smiling daphne has accepted you he sank into an easy chair beside himself with rapture yes yes that angel thanks to you she has accepted me thanks to miss wade i said correcting him it is really all her doing if she had not seen through the photograph to the face and through the face to the woman and the base little heart of her we might never have found her out he turned to hilda with eyes all gratitude you have given me the dearest and best girl on earth he cried seizing both her hands and i have given daphne a husband who will love and appreciate her hilda answered flushing you see i said maliciously i told you they never find us out holsworthy as for reggie nettlecraft and his wife i should like to add that they are getting on quite as well as could be expected reggie has joined his sissie on the musicall stage and all those who have witnessed his immensely popular performance of the drunken gentleman before the bow street police court acknowledge without reserve that after failing for everything he has dropped at last into his true vocation his impersonation of the part is said to be nature itself i see no reason to doubt it chapter the episode of the wife who did her duty to make you understand my next yarn i must go back to the date of my introduction to hilda it is witchcraft i said the first time i saw her at le geyt luncheonarty she smiled a smile which was bewitching indeed but by no means witchike frank open smile with just a touch of natural feminine triumph in it no not witchcraft she answered helping herself with her dainty fingers to a burnt almond from the venetian glass dish not witchcraft emory aided perhaps by some native quickness of perception though i say it myself i never met anyone i think whose memory goes quite as far as mine does you don mean quite as far back i cried jesting for she looked about twentyour and had cheeks like a ripe nectarine just as pink and just as softly downy she smiled again showing a row of semiransparent teeth with a gleam in the depths of them she was certainly most attractive she had that indefinable incommunicable unanalysable personal quality which we know as charm no not as far back she repeated though indeed i often seem to remember things that happened before i was born like queen elizabeth visit to kenilwort i recollect so vividly all that i have heard or read about them but as far in extent i mean i never let anything drop out of my memory as this case shows you i can recall even quite unimportant and casual bits of knowledge when any chance clue happens to bring them back to me she had certainly astonished me the occasion for my astonishment was the fact that when i handed her my card dr hubert ford cumberledge st nathaniel hospital she had glanced at it for a second and exclaimed without sensible pause or break oh then of course youe half welsh as i am the instantaneous and apparent inconsecutiveness of her inference took me aback well mes i am half welsh i replied my mother came from carnarvonshire but why then and of course i fail to perceive your train of reasoning she laughed a sunny little laugh like one well accustomed to receive such inquiries fancy asking a woman to give you he train of reasoning for her intuitions she cried merrily that shows dr cumberledge that you are a mere man man of science perhaps but not a psychologist it also suggests that you are a confirmed bachelor a married man accepts intuitions without expecting them to be based on reasoning well just this once i will stretch a point to enlighten you if i recollect right your mother died about three years ago you are quite correct then you knew my mother oh dear me no i never even met her why then her look was mischievous but unless i mistake i think she came from hendre coed near bangor wales is a village i exclaimed catching my breath every welsh person seems to know all about every other my new acquaintance smiled again when she smiled she was irresistible a laughing face protruding from a cloud of diaphanous drapery now shall i tell you how i came to know that she asked poising a glace cherry on her dessert fork in front of her shall i explain my trick like the conjurers conjurers never explain anything i answered they say o you see that how it done ith a swift whisk of the hand nd leave you as much in the dark as ever don explain like the conjurers but tell me how you guessed it she shut her eyes and seemed to turn her glance inward about three years ago she began slowly like one who reconstructs with an effort a halforgotten scene i saw a notice in the times irths deaths and marriages n the th of october as it the th the keen brown eyes opened again for a second and flashed inquiry into mine quite right i answered nodding i thought so n the th of october at brynmor bournemouth emily olwen josephine widow of the late thomas cumberledge sometime colonel of the th bengal regiment of foot and daughter of iolo gwyn ford esq j p of hendre coed near bangor am i correct she lifted her dark eyelashes once more and flooded me you are quite correct i answered surprised and that is really all that you knew of my mother absolutely all the moment i saw your card i thought to myself in a breath ord cumberledge what do i know of those two names i have some link between them ah yes found mrs cumberledge wife of colonel thomas cumberledge of the th bengals was a miss ford daughter of a mr ford of bangor that came to me like a lightningleam then i said to myself again r hubert ford cumberledge must be their son so there you have he train of reasoning women can reason ometimes i had to think twice though before i could recall the exact words of the times notice and can you do the same with everyone everyone oh come now that is expecting too much i have not read marked learned and inwardly digested everyone family announcements i don pretend to be the peerage the clergy list and the london directory rolled into one i remembered your family all the more vividly no doubt because of the pretty and unusual old welsh names lwen and olo gwyn ford which fixed themselves on my memory by their mere beauty everything about wales always attracts me my welsh side is uppermost but i have hundreds h thousands f such facts stored and pigeonoled in my memory if anybody else cares to try me she glanced round the table perhaps we may be able to test my power that way two or three of the company accepted her challenge giving the full names of their sisters or brothers and in three cases out of five my witch was able to supply either the notice of their marriage or some other like published circumstance in the instance of charlie vere it is true she went wrong just at first though only in a single small particular it was not charlie himself who was gazetted to a subieutenancy in the warwickshire regiment but his brother walter however the moment she was told of this slip she corrected herself at once and added like lightning ah yes how stupid of me i have mixed up the names charles cassilis vere got an appointment on the same day in the rhodesian mounted police didn he which was in point of fact quite accurate but i am forgetting that all this time i have not even now introduced my witch to you hilda wade when i first saw her was one of the prettiest cheeriest and most graceful girls i have ever met dusky blonde brownyed brownaired with a creamy waxen whiteness of skin that was yet warm and peachowny and i wish to insist from the outset upon the plain fact that there was nothing uncanny about her in spite of her singular faculty of insight which sometimes seemed to illogical people almost weird or she was in the main a bright wellducated sensible winsome lawnennislaying english girl her vivacious spirits rose superior to her surroundings which were often sad enough but she was above all things wholesome unaffected and sparkling gleam of sunshine she laid no claim to supernatural powers she held no dealings with familiar spirits she was simply a girl of strong personal charm endowed with an astounding memory and a rare measure of feminine intuition her memory she told me she shared with her father and all her father family they were famous for their prodigious faculty in that respect her impulsive temperament and quick instincts on the other hand descended to her she thought from her mother and her welsh ancestry externally she seemed thus at first sight little more than the ordinary pretty lightearted english girl with a taste for field sports especially ridin and a native love of the country but at times one caught in the brightened colour of her lustrous brown eyes certain curious undercurrents of depth of reserve and of a questioning wistfulness which made you suspect the presence of profounder elements in her nature from the earliest moment of our acquaintance indeed i can say with truth that hilda wade interested me immensely i felt drawn her face had that strange quality of compelling attention for which we have as yet no english name but which everybody recognises you could not ignore her she stood out she was the sort of girl one was constrained to notice it was le geyts first luncheonarty since his second marriage bigearded genial he beamed round on us jubilant he was proud of his wife and proud of his recent q hip the new mrs le geyt sat at the head of the table handsome capable selfossessed a vivid vigorous woman and a model hostess though still quite young she was large and commanding everybody was impressed by her such a good mother to those poor motherless children all the ladies declared in a chorus of applause and indeed she had the face of a splendid manager i said as much in an undertone over the ices to miss wade who sat beside me hough i ought not to have discussed them at their own table hugo le geyt seems to have made an excellent choice i murmured maisie and ettie will be lucky indeed to be taken care of by such a competent stepmother don you think so my witch glanced up at her hostess with a piercing dart of the keen brown eyes held her winelass half raised and then electrified me by uttering in the same low voice audible to me alone but quite clearly and unhesitatingly these astounding words i think before twelve mouths are out mr le geyt will have murdered her for a minute i could not answer so startling was the effect of this confident prediction one does not expect to be told such things at lunch over the port and peaches about one dearest friends beside their own mahogany and the assured air of unfaltering conviction with which hilda wade said it to a complete stranger took my breath away why did she think so at all and if she thought so why choose me as the recipient of her singular confidences i gasped and wondered what makes you fancy anything so unlikely i asked aside at last behind the babel of voices you quite alarm me she rolled a mouthful of apricot ice reflectively on her tongue and then murmured in a similar aside don ask me now some other time will do but i mean what i say believe me i do not speak at random she was quite right of course to continue would have been equally rude and foolish i had perforce to bottle up my curiosity for the moment and wait till my sibyl was in the mood for interpreting after lunch we adjourned to the drawingoom almost at once hilda wade flitted up with her brisk step to the corner where i was sitting oh dr cumberledge she began as if nothing odd had occurred before i was so glad to meet you and have a chance of talking to you because i do so want to get a nurse place at st nathaniel a nurse place i exclaimed a little surprised surveying her dress of palest and softest indian muslin for she looked to me far too much of a butterfly for such serious work do you really mean it or are you one of the ten thousand modern young ladies who are in quest of a mission without understanding that missions are unpleasant nursing i can tell you is not all crimped cap and becoming uniform i know that she answered growing grave i ought to know it i am a nurse already at st george hospital you are a nurse and at st george yet you want to change to nathaniel why st george is in a much nicer part of london and the patients there come on an average from a much better class than ours in smithfield i know that too but sebastian is at st nathaniel nd i want to be near sebastian professor sebastian i cried my face lighting up with a gleam of enthusiasm at our great teacher name ah if it is to be under sebastian that you desire i can see you mean business i know now you are in earnest in earnest she echoed that strange deeper shade coming over her face as she spoke while her tone altered yes i think i am in earnest it is my object in life to be near sebastian o watch him and observe him i mean to succeed but i have given you my confidence perhaps too hastily and i must implore you not to mention my wish to him you may trust me implicitly i answered oh yes i saw that she put in with a quick gesture of course i saw by your face you were a man of honour man one could trust or i would not have spoken to you but ou promise me i promise you i replied naturally flattered she was delicately pretty and her quaint oracular air so incongruous with the dainty face and the fluffy brown hair piqued me not a little that special mysterious commodity of charm seemed to pervade all she did and said so i added and i will mention to sebastian that you wish for a nurse place at nathaniel as you have had experience and can be recommended i suppose by le geyt sister with whom she had come no doubt you can secure an early vacancy thanks so much she answered with that delicious smile it had an infantile simplicity about it which contrasted most piquantly with her prophetic manner only i went on assuming a confidential tone you really must tell me why you said that just now about hugo le geyt recollect your delphian utterances have gravely astonished and disquieted me hugo is one of my oldest and dearest friends and i want to know why you have formed this sudden bad opinion of him not of him but of her she answered to my surprise taking a small norwegian dagger from the whatot and playing with it to distract attention come come now i cried drawing back you are trying to mystify me this is deliberate seerongery you are presuming on your powers but i am not the sort of man to be caught by horoscopes i decline to believe it she turned on me with a meaning glance those truthful eyes fixed me i am going from here straight to my hospital she murmured with a quiet air of knowledge alking i mean to say like one who really knows this room is not the place to discuss this matter is it if you will walk back to st george with me i think i can make you see and feel that i am speaking not at haphazard but from observation and experience her confidence roused my most vivid curiosity when she left i left with her the le geyts lived in one of those new streets of large houses on campden hill so that our way eastward lay naturally through kensington gardens it was a sunny june day when light pierced even through the smoke of london and the shrubberies breathed the breath of white lilacs now what did you mean by that enigmatical saying i asked my new cassandra as we strolled down the scentaden path woman intuition is all very well in its way but a mere man may be excused if he asks for evidence she stopped short as i spoke and gazed full into my eyes her hand fingered her parasol handle i meant what i said she answered with emphasis within one year mr le geyt will have murdered his wife you may take my word for it le geyt i cried never i know the man so well a big goodatured kindly schoolboy he is the gentlest and best of mortals le geyt a murderer im ossible her eyes were far away has it never occurred to you she asked slowly with her pythoness air that there are murders and murders urders which depend in the main upon the murderer and also murders which depend in the main upon the victim the victim what do you mean well there are brutal men who commit murder out of sheer brutality he ruffians of the slums and there are sordid men who commit murder for sordid money he insurers who want to forestall their policies the poisoners who want to inherit property but have you ever realised that there are also murderers who become so by accident through their victims idiosyncrasy i thought all the time while i was watching mrs le geyt hat woman is of the sort predestined to be murdered and when you asked me i told you so i may have been imprudent still i saw it and i said it but this is second sight i cried drawing away do you pretend to prevision no not second sight nothing uncanny nothing supernatural but prevision yes prevision based not on omens or auguries but on solid fact n what i have seen and noticed explain yourself oh prophetess she let the point of her parasol make a curved trail on the gravel and followed its serpentine wavings with her eyes you know our house surgeon she asked at last looking up of a sudden what travers oh intimately then come to my ward and see after you have seen you will perhaps believe me nothing that i could say would get any further explanation out of her just then you would laugh at me if i told you she persisted you won laugh when you have seen it we walked on in silence as far as hyde park corner there my sphinx tripped lightly up the steps of st george hospital get mr travers leave she said with a nod and a bright smile to visit nurse wade ward then come up to me there in five minutes i explained to my friend the house surgeon that i wished to see certain cases in the accident ward of which i had heard he smiled a restrained smile nurse wade no doubt but of course gave me permission to go up and look at them stop a minute he added and il come with you when we got there my witch had already changed her dress and was waiting for us demurely in the neat doveoloured gown and smooth white apron of the hospital nurses she looked even prettier and more meaningful so than in her ethereal outside summerloud muslin come over to this bed she said at once to travers and myself without the least air of mystery i will show you what i mean by it nurse wade has remarkable insight travers whispered to me as we went i can believe it i answered look at this woman she went on aside in a low voice no not the first bed the one beyond it number i don want the patient to know you are watching her do you observe anything odd about her appearance she is somewhat the same type i began as mrs before i could get out the words le geyt her warning eye and puckering forehead had stopped me as the lady we were discussing she interposed with a quiet wave of one hand yes in some points very much so you notice in particular her scanty hair o thin and poor hough she is young and goodooking it is certainly rather a feeble crop for a woman of her age i admitted and pale at that and washy precisely it done up behind about as big as a nutmeg now observe the contour of her back as she sits up there it is curiously curved isn it very i replied not exactly a stoop nor yet quite a hunch but certainly an odd spinal configuration like our friend once more like our friend exactly hilda wade looked away lest she should attract the patient attention well that woman was brought in here halfead assaulted by her husband she went on with a note of unobtrusive demonstration we get a great many such cases travers put in with true medical unconcern very interesting cases and nurse wade has pointed out to me the singular fact that in almost all instances the patients resemble one another physically incredible i cried i can understand that there might well be a type of men who assault their wives but not surely a type of women who get assaulted that is because you know less about it than nurse wade travers answered with an annoying smile of superior knowledge our instructress moved on to another bed laying one gentle hand as she passed on a patient forehead the patient glanced gratitude that one again she said once more half indicating a cot at a little distance number she has much the same thin hair parse weak and colourless she has much the same curved back and much the same aggressive selfssertive features looks capable doesn she a born housewife well she too was knocked down and kicked halfead the other night by her husband it is certainly odd i answered how very much they both recall our friend at lunch yes extraordinary see here she pulled out a pencil and drew the quick outline of a face in her noteook that is what is central and essential to the type they have this sort of profile women with faces like that always get assaulted travers glanced over her shoulder quite true he assented with his bourgeois nod nurse wade in her time has shown me dozens of them round dozens bakers dozens they all belong to that species in fact when a woman of this type is brought in to us wounded now i ask at once usband and the invariable answer comes pat ell yes sir we had some words together the effect of words my dear fellow is something truly surprising they can pierce like a dagger i mused and leave an open wound behind that requires dressing travers added unsuspecting practical man travers but why do they get assaulted he women of this type i asked still bewildered number has her mother just come to see her my sorceress interposed she an assault case brought in last night badly kicked and bruised about the head and shoulders speak to the mother shel explain it all to you travers and i moved over to the cot her hand scarcely indicated well your daughter looks pretty comfortable this afternoon in spite of the little fuss travers began tentatively yus she a bit tidy thanky the mother answered smoothing her soiled black gown grown green with long service shel git on naow please gord but joe most did for r how did it all happen travers asked in a jaunty tone to draw her out well it was like this sir yer see my daughter she a lidy as keeps rself to rself as the sayin is an lds r ad up she keeps up a proper pride an minds r use an r little uns she ain no gadabaht but she ve a tongue she ve the mother lowered her voice cautiously lest the lidy should hear i don deny it that she ve a tongue at times through myself vin suffered from it and when she do go on lord bless you why there ain no stoppin of r oh she has a tongue has she travers replied surveying the case critically well you know she looks like it so she do sir so she do an joe a man as wouldn rt a biby ot when sober joe wouldn but bin aht that where it is an cum me lite a bit fresh through vin bin at the friendly lead an my daughter yer see she up an give it to my word she did give it to an joe a peaceable man when ain a bit fresh more like a friend to r than an sband joe is but lost s temper that time as yer may say by reason o bein fresh an knocked r abaht a little an knocked r teeth aht so we brought r to the orspital the injured woman raised herself up in bed with a vindictive scowl displaying as she did so the same whaleike curved back as in the other cases but wee sent to the lockup she continued the scowl giving way fast to a radiant joy of victory as she contemplated her triumph an wot more i the last word of n git six month for this the neighbours says an when he comes aht again my gord won ketch it you look capable of punishing him for it i answered and as i spoke i shuddered for i saw her expression was precisely the expression mrs le geyt face had worn for a passing second when her husband accidentally trod on her dress as we left the diningoom my witch moved away we followed well what do you say to it now she asked gliding among the beds with noiseless feet and ministering fingers say to it i answered that it is wonderful wonderful you have quite convinced me you would think so travers put in if you had been in this ward as often as i have and observed their faces it a dead certainty sooner or later that type of woman is cockure to be assaulted in a certain rank of life perhaps i answered still loth to believe it but not surely in ours gentlemen do not knock down their wives and kick their teeth out my sibyl smiled no there class tells she admitted they take longer about it and suffer more provocation they curb their tempers but in the end one day they are goaded beyond endurance and then convenient knife rusty old sword pair of scissors nything that comes handy like that dagger this morning one wild blow alf unpremeditated nd the thing is done twelve good men and true will find it wilful murder i felt really perturbed but can we do nothing i cried to warn poor hugo nothing i fear she answered after all character must work itself out in its interactions with character he has married that woman and he must take the consequences does not each of us in life suffer perforce the nemesis of his own temperament then is there not also a type of men who assault their wives that is the odd part of it o all kinds good and bad quick and slow can be driven to it at last the quickempered stab or kick the slow devise some deliberate means of ridding themselves of their burden but surely we might caution le geyt of his danger it is useless he would not believe us we cannot be at his elbow to hold back his hand when the bad moment comes nobody will be there as a matter of fact for women of this temperament orn naggers in short since that what it comes to hen they are also ladies graceful and gracious as she is never nag at all before outsiders to the world they are bland everybody says hat charming talkers they are ngels abroad devils at home as the proverb puts it some night she will provoke him when they are alone till she has reached his utmost limit of endurance nd then she drew one hand across her doveike throat it will be all finished you think so i am sure of it we human beings go straight like sheep to our natural destiny but hat is fatalism no not fatalism insight into temperament fatalists believe that your life is arranged for you beforehand from without willyilly you must act so i only believe that in this jostling world your life is mostly determined by your own character in its interaction with the characters of those who surround you temperament works itself out it is your own acts and deeds that make up fate for you for some months after this meeting neither hilda wade nor i saw anything more of the le geyts they left town for scotland at the end of the season and when all the grouse had been duly slaughtered and all the salmon duly hooked they went on to leicestershire for the opening of foxunting so it was not till after christmas that they returned to campden hill meanwhile i had spoken to dr sebastian about miss wade and on my recommendation he had found her a vacancy at our hospital a most intelligent girl cumberledge he remarked to me with a rare burst of approval or the professor was always critical fter she had been at work for some weeks at st nathaniel i am glad you introduced her here a nurse with brains is such a valuable accessory nless of course she takes to thinking but nurse wade never thinks she is a useful instrument oes what she told and carries out one orders implicitly she knows enough to know when she doesn know i answered which is really the rarest kind of knowledge unrecorded among young doctors the professor retorted with his sardonic smile they think they understand the human body from top to toe when in reality ell they might do the measles early in january i was invited again to lunch with the le geyts hilda wade was invited too the moment we entered the house we were both of us aware that some grim change had come over it le geyt met us in the hall in his old genial style it is true but still with a certain reserve a curious veiled timidity which we had not known in him big and goodumoured as he was with kindly eyes beneath the shaggy eyebrows he seemed strangely subdued now the boyish buoyancy had gone out of him he spoke rather lower than was his natural key and welcomed us warmly though less effusively than of old an irreproachable housemaid in a spotless cap ushered us into the transfigured drawingoom mrs le geyt in a pretty cloth dress neatly tailorade rose to meet us beaming the vapid smile of the perfect hostess hat impartial smile which falls like the rain from heaven on good and bad indifferently so charmed to see you again dr cumberledge she bubbled out with a cheerful air he was always cheerful mechanically cheerful from a sense of duty it is such a pleasure to meet dear hugo old friends and miss wade too how delightful you look so well miss wade oh youe both at st nathaniel now aren you so you can come together what a privilege for you dr cumberledge to have such a clever assistant r rather felloworker it must be a great life yours miss wade such a sphere of usefulness if we can only feel we are doing good hat is the main matter for my own part i like to be mixed up with every good work that going on in my neighbourhood i the soupitchen you know and i visitor at the workhouse and i the dorcas society and the mutual improvement class and the prevention of cruelty to animals and to children and i sure i don know how much else so that what with all that and what with dear hugo and the darling children he glanced affectionately at maisie and ettie who sat bolt upright very mute and still in their best and stiffest frocks on two stools in the corner i can hardly find time for my social duties oh dear mrs le geyt one of her visitors said with effusion from beneath a nodding bonnet he was the wife of a rural dean from staffordshire everybody is agreed that your social duties are performed to a marvel they are the envy of kensington we all of us wonder indeed how one woman can find time for all of it our hostess looked pleased well yes she answered gazing down at her fawnoloured dress with a halfuppressed smile of selfatisfaction i flatter myself i can get through about as much work in a day as anybody her eye wandered round her rooms with a modest air of placid selfpproval which was almost comic everything in them was as wellept and as wellolished as good servants thoroughly drilled could make it not a stain or a speck anywhere a miracle of neatness indeed when i carelessly drew the norwegian dagger from its scabbard as we waited for lunch and found that it stuck in the sheath i almost started to discover that rust could intrude into that orderly household i recollected then how hilda wade had pointed out to me during those six months at st nathaniel that the women whose husbands assaulted them were almost always notable housewives as they say in america souls who prided themselves not a little on their skill in management they were capable practical mothers of families with a boundless belief in themselves a sincere desire to do their duty as far as they understood it and a habit of impressing their virtues upon others which was quite beyond all human endurance placidity was their note provoking placidity i felt sure it must have been of a woman of this type that the famous phrase was coined elle a toutes les vertus t elle est insupportable clara dear the husband said shall we go in to lunch you dear stupid boy are we not all waiting for you to give your arm to lady maitland the lunch was perfect and it was perfectly served the silver glowed the linen was marked with h le g in a most artistic monogram i noticed that the table decorations were extremely pretty somebody complimented our hostess upon them mrs le geyt nodded and smiled i arranged them dear hugo in his blundering way he big darling orgot to get me the orchids i had ordered so i had to make shift with what few things our own wee conservatory afforded still with a little taste and a little ingenuity she surveyed her handiwork with just pride and left the rest to our imaginations only you ought to explain clara le geyt began in a deprecatory tone now you darling old bear we won harp on that twiceold tale again clara interrupted with a knowing smile point da rechauffes let us leave one another misdeeds and one another explanations for their proper sphere he family circle the orchids did not turn up that is the point and i managed to make shift with the plumbago and the geraniums maisie my sweet not that pudding if you please too rich for you darling i know your digestive capacities better than you do i have told you fifty times it doesn agree with you a small slice of the other one yes mamma maisie answered with a cowed and cowering air i felt sure she would have murmured yes mamma in the selfsame tone if the second mrs le geyt had ordered her to hang herself i saw you out in the park yesterday on your bicycle ettie le geyt sister mrs mallet put in but do you know dear i didn think your jacket was half warm enough mamma doesn like me to wear a warmer one the child answered with a visible shudder of recollection though i should love to aunt lina my precious ettie what nonsense or a violent exercise like bicycling where one gets so hot so unbecomingly hot you be simply stifled darling i caught a darted glance which accompanied the words and which made ettie recoil into the recesses of her pudding but yesterday was so cold clara mrs mallet went on actually venturing to oppose the infallible authority a nipping morning and such a flimsy coat might not the dear child be allowed to judge for herself in a matter purely of her own feelings mrs le geyt with just the shadow of a shrug was all sweet reasonableness she smiled more suavely than ever surely lina she remonstrated in her frankest and most convincing tone i must know best what is good for dear ettie when i have been watching her daily for more than six months past and taking the greatest pains to understand both her constitution and her disposition she needs hardening ettie does hardening don you agree with me hugo le geyt shuffled uneasily in his chair big man as he was with his great black beard and manly bearing i could see he was afraid to differ from her overtly well erhaps clara he began peering from under the shaggy eyebrows it would be best for a delicate child like ettie mrs le geyt smiled a compassionate smile ah i forgot she cooed sweetly dear hugo never can understand the upbringing of children it is a sense denied him we women know ith a sage nod they were wild little savages when i took them in hand first eren you maisie do you remember dear how you broke the lookinglass in the boudoir like an untamed young monkey talking of monkeys mr cotswould have you seen those delightful clever amusing french pictures at that place in suffolk street there a man there parisian forget his honoured name eblanc or lenoir or lebrun or something ut he a most humorous artist and he paints monkeys and storks and all sorts of queer beasties almost as quaintly and expressively as you do mind i say almost for i never will allow that any frenchman could do anything quite so good quite so funnily mockuman as your marabouts and professors what a charming hostess mrs le geyt makes the painter observed to me after lunch such tact such discrimination and what a devoted stepmother she is one of the local secretaries of the society for the prevention of cruelty to children i said drily and charity begins at home hilda wade added in a significant aside we walked home together as far as stanhope gate our sense of doom oppressed us and yet i said turning to her as we left the doorstep i don doubt mrs le geyt really believes she is a model stepmother of course she believes it my witch answered she has no more doubt about that than about anything else doubts are not in her line she does everything exactly as it ought to be done ho should know if not she nd therefore she is never afraid of criticism hardening indeed that poor slender tender shrinking little ettie a frail exotic she would harden her into a skeleton if she had her way nothing much harder than a skeleton i suppose except mrs le geyt manner of training one i should be sorry to think i broke in that that sweet little floating thistleown of a child i once knew was to be done to death by her oh as for that she will not be done to death hilda answered in her confident way mrs le geyt won live long enough i started you think not i don think i am sure of it we are at the fifth act now i watched mr le geyt closely all through lunch and i more confident than ever that the end is coming he is temporarily crushed but he is like steam in a boiler seething seething seething one day she will sit on the safetyalve and the explosion will come when it comes he raised aloft one quick hand in the air as if striking a dagger home goodye to her for the next few months i saw much of le geyt and the more i saw of him the more i saw that my witch prognosis was essentially correct they never quarrelled but mrs le geyt in her unobtrusive way held a quiet hand over her husband which became increasingly apparent in the midst of her fancyork those busy fingers were never idl she kept her eyes well fixed on him now and again i saw him glance at his motherless girls with what looked like a tender protecting regret especially when clara had been most openly drilling them but he dared not interfere she was crushing their spirit as she was crushing their father nd all bear in mind for the best of motives she had their interest at heart she wanted to do what was right for them her manner to him and to them was always honeyweet n all externals yet one could somehow feel it was the velvet glove that masked the iron hand not cruel not harsh even but severely irresistibly unflinchingly crushing ettie my dear get your brown hat at once what that going to rain i did not ask you my child for your opinion on the weather my own suffices a headache oh nonsense headaches are caused by want of exercise nothing so good for a touch of headache as a nice brisk walk in kensington gardens maisie don hold your sister hand like that it is imitation sympathy you are aiding and abetting her in setting my wishes at naught now no long faces what i require is cheerful obedience a bland autocratic martinet smiling inexorable poor pale ettie grew thinner and wanner under her law daily while maisie temper naturally docile was being spoiled before one eyes by persistent needless thwarting as spring came on however i began to hope that things were really mending le geyt looked brighter some of his own careless happyoucky self came back again at intervals he told me once with a wistful sigh that he thought of sending the children to school in the country t would be better for them he said and would take a little work off dear clara shoulders for never even to me was he disloyal to clara i encouraged him in the idea he went on to say that the great difficulty in the way was clara she was so conscientious she thought it her duty to look after the children herself and couldn bear to delegate any part of that duty to others besides she had such an excellent opinion of the kensington high school when i told hilda wade of this she set her teeth together and answered at once that settles it the end is very near he will insist upon their going to save them from that woman ruthless kindness and she will refuse to give up any part of what she calls her duty he will reason with her he will plead for his children she will be adamant not angry t is never the way of that temperament to get angry ust calmly sedately and insupportably provoking when she goes too far he will flare up at last some taunt will rouse him the explosion will come and the children will go to their aunt lina whom they dote upon when all is said and done it is the poor man i pity you said within twelve months that was a bow drawn at a venture it may be a little sooner it may be a little later but ext week or next month t is coming it is coming june smiled upon us once more and on the afternoon of the th the anniversary of our first lunch together at the le geyts i was up at my work in the accident ward at st nathaniel well the ides of june have come sister wade i said when i met her parodying caesar but not yet gone she answered and a profound sense of foreboding spread over her speaking face as she uttered the words her oracle disquieted me why i dined there last night i cried and all seemed exceptionally well the calm before the storm perhaps she murmured just at that moment i heard a boy crying in the street pall mall gazette re yre speshul edishun shocking tragedy at the westnd orful murder re yre spechul globe pall mall extry speshul a weird tremor broke over me i walked down into the street and bought a paper there it stared me in the face on the middle page tragedy at campden hill wellnown barrister murders his wife sensational details i looked closer and read it was as i feared the le geyts after i left their house the night before husband and wife must have quarrelled no doubt over the question of the children schooling and at some provoking word as it seemed hugo must have snatched up a knife a little ornamental norwegian dagger the report said which happened to lie close by on the cabinet in the drawingoom and plunged it into his wife heart the unhappy lady died instantaneously by all appearances and the dastardly crime was not discovered by the servants till eight olock this morning mr le geyt is missing i rushed up with the news to nurse wade who was at work in the accident ward she turned pale but bent over her patient and said nothing it is fearful to think i groaned out at last for us who know all hat poor le geyt will be hanged for it hanged for attempting to protect his children he will not be hanged my witch answered with the same unquestioning confidence as ever why not i asked astonished once more at this bold prediction she went on bandaging the arm of the patient whom she was attending because he will commit suicide she replied without moving a muscle how do you know that she stuck a steel safetyin with deft fingers into the roll of lint when i have finished my day work she answered slowly still continuing the bandage i may perhaps find time to tell you chapter the episode of the man who would not commit suicide after my poor friend le geyt had murdered his wife in a sudden access of uncontrollable anger under the deepest provocation the police naturally began to inquire for him it is a way they have the police are no respecters of persons neither do they pry into the question of motives they are but poor casuists a murder is for them a murder and a murderer a murderer it is not their habit to divide and distinguish between case and case with hilda wade analytical accuracy as soon as my duties at st nathaniel permitted me on the evening of the discovery i rushed round to mrs mallet le geyt sister i had been detained at the hospital for some hours however watching a critical case and by the time i reached great stanhope street i found hilda wade in her nurse dress there before me sebastian it seemed had given her leave out for the evening she was a supernumerary nurse attached to his own observationots as special attendant for scientific purposes and she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it mrs mallet had been in the breakfastoom with hilda before i arrived but as i reached the house she rushed upstairs to wash her red eyes and compose herself a little before the strain of meeting me so i had the opportunity for a few words alone first with my prophetic companion you said just now at nathaniel i burst out that le geyt would not be hanged he would commit suicide what did you mean by that what reason had you for thinking so hilda sank into a chair by the open window pulled a flower abstractedly from the vase at her side and began picking it to pieces floret after floret with twitching fingers she was deeply moved well consider his family history she burst out at last looking up at me with her large brown eyes as she reached the last petal heredity counts and after such a disaster she said disaster not crime i noted mentally the reservation implied in the word heredity counts i answered oh yes it counts much but what about le geyt family history i could not recall any instance of suicide among his forbears well is mother father was general faskally you know she replied after a pause in her strange oblique manner mr le geyt is general faskally eldest grandson exactly i broke in with a man desire for solid fact in place of vague intuition but i fail to see quite what that has to do with it the general was killed in india during the mutiny i remember of course illed bravely fighting yes but it was on a forlorn hope for which he volunteered and in the course of which he is said to have walked straight into an almost obvious ambuscade of the enemy now my dear miss wade always dropped the title of nurse by request when once we were well clear of nathaniel i have every confidence you are aware in your memory and your insight but i do confess i fail to see what bearing this incident can have on poor hugo chances of being hanged or committing suicide she picked a second flower and once more pulled out petal after petal as she reached the last again she answered slowly you must have forgotten the circumstances it was no mere accident general faskally had made a serious strategical blunder at jhansi he had sacrificed the lives of his subordinates needlessly he could not bear to face the survivors in the course of the retreat he volunteered to go on this forlorn hope which might equally well have been led by an officer of lower rank and he was permitted to do so by sir colin in command as a means of retrieving his lost military character he carried his point but he carried it recklessly taking care to be shot through the heart himself in the first onslaught that was virtual suicide onourable suicide to avoid disgrace at a moment of supreme remorse and horror you are right i admitted after a minute consideration i see it now hough i should never have thought of it that is the use of being a woman she answered i waited a second once more and mused still that is only one doubtful case i objected there was another you must remember his uncle alfred alfred le geyt no he died in his bed quietly alfred faskally what a memory you have i cried astonished why that was before our time n the days of the chartist riots she smiled a certain curious sibylline smile of hers her earnest face looked prettier than ever i told you i could remember many things that happened before i was born she answered this is one of them you remember it directly how impossible have i not often explained to you that i am no diviner i read no book of fate i call no spirits from the vasty deep i simply remember with exceptional clearness what i read and hear and i have many times heard the story about alfred faskally so have i ut i forget it unfortunately i can forget that is a sort of disease with me he was a special constable in the chartist riots and being a very strong and powerful man like his nephew hugo he used his truncheon is special constable baton or whatever you call it ith excessive force upon a starveling london tailor in the mob near charing cross the man was hit on the forehead adly hit so that he died almost immediately of concussion of the brain a woman rushed out of the crowd at once seized the dying man laid his head on her lap and shrieked out in a wildly despairing voice that he was her husband and the father of thirteen children alfred faskally who never meant to kill the man or even to hurt him but who was laying about him roundly without realising the terrific force of his blows was so horrified at what he had done when he heard the woman cry that he rushed off straight to waterloo bridge in an agony of remorse and lung himself over he was drowned instantly i recall the story now i answered but do you know as it was told me i think they said the mob threw faskally over in their desire for vengeance that is the official account as told by the le geyts and the faskallys they like to have it believed their kinsman was murdered not that he committed suicide but my grandfather started during the twelve months that i had been brought into daily relations with hilda wade that was the first time i had heard her mention any member of her own family except once her mother my grandfather who knew him well and who was present in the crowd at the time assured me many times that alfred faskally really jumped over of his own accord not pursued by the mob and that his last horrified words as he leaped were never meant it i never meant it however the family have always had luck in their suicides the jury believed the throwingver story and found a verdict of ilful murder against some person or persons unknown luck in their suicides what a curious phrase and you say always were there other cases then constructively yes one of the le geyts you must recollect went down with his ship just like his uncle the general in indi when he might have quitted her it is believed he had given a mistaken order you remember of course he was navigating lieutenant another marcus was said to have shot himself by accident while cleaning his gun fter a quarrel with his wife but you have heard all about it he wrong was on my side he moaned you know when they picked him up dying in the gunoom and one of the faskally girls his cousin of whom his wife was jealous hat beautiful linda ecame a catholic and went into a convent at once on marcus death which after all in such cases is merely a religious and moral way of committing suicide mean for a woman who takes the veil just to cut herself off from the world and who has no vocation as i hear she had not she filled me with amazement that is true i exclaimed when one comes to think of it it shows the same temperament in fibre but i should never have thought of it no well i believe it is true for all that in every case one sees they choose much the same way of meeting a reverse a blunder an unpremeditated crime the brave way is to go through with it and face the music letting what will come the cowardly way is to hide one head incontinently in a river a noose or a convent cell le geyt is not a coward i interposed with warmth no not a coward manly spirited greatearted gentleman ut still not quite of the bravest type he lacks one element the le geyts have physical courage nough and to spare ut their moral courage fails them at a pinch they rush into suicide or its equivalent at critical moments out of pure boyish impulsiveness a few minutes later mrs mallet came in she was not broken down n the contrary she was calm toically tragically pitiably calm with that ghastly calmness which is more terrible by far than the most demonstrative grief her face though deadly white did not move a muscle not a tear was in her eyes even her bloodless hands hardly twitched at the folds of her hastily assumed black gown she clenched them after a minute when she had grasped mine silently i could see that the nails dug deep into the palms in her painful resolve to keep herself from collapsing hilda wade with infinite sisterly tenderness led her over to a chair by the window in the summer twilight and took one quivering hand in hers i have been telling dr cumberledge lina about what i most fear for your dear brother darling and i think he agrees with me mrs mallet turned to me with hollow eyes still preserving her tragic calm i am afraid of it too she said her drawn lips tremulous dr cumberledge we must get him back we must induce him to face it and yet i answered slowly turning it over in my own mind he has run away at first why should he do that if he means o commit suicide i hated to utter the words before that broken soul but there was no way out of it hilda interrupted me with a quiet suggestion how do you know he has run away she asked are you not taking it for granted that if he meant suicide he would blow his brains out in his own house but surely that would not be the le geyt way they are gentleatured folk they would never blow their brains out or cut their throats for all we know he may have made straight for waterloo bridge he framed her lips to the unspoken words unseen by mrs mallet like his uncle alfred that is true i answered lipeading i never thought of that either still i do not attach importance to this idea she went on i have some reason for thinking he has run away elsewhere and if so our first task must be to entice him back again what are your reasons i asked humbly whatever they might be i knew enough of hilda wade by this time to know that she had probably good grounds for accepting them oh they may wait for the present she answered other things are more pressing first let lina tell us what she thinks of most moment mrs mallet braced herself up visibly to a distressing effort you have seen the body dr cumberledge she faltered no dear mrs mallet i have not i came straight from nathaniel i have had no time to see it dr sebastian has viewed it by my wish e has been so kind nd he will be present as representing the family at the postortem he notes that the wound was inflicted with a dagger small ornamental norwegian dagger which always lay as i know on the little whatot by the blue sofa i nodded assent exactly i have seen it there it was blunt and rusty mere toy knife ot at all the sort of weapon a man would make use of who designed to commit a deliberate murder the crime if there was a crime which we do not admi must therefore have been wholly unpremeditated i bowed my head for us who knew hugo that goes without saying she leaned forward eagerly dr sebastian has pointed out to me a line of defence which would probably succeed f we could only induce poor hugo to adopt it he has examined the blade and scabbard and finds that the dagger fits its sheath very tight so that it can only be withdrawn with considerable violence the blade sticks i nodded again it needs a hard pull to wrench it out he has also inspected the wound and assures me its character is such that it might have been selfnflicted she paused now and again and brought out her words with difficulty selfnflicted he suggests therefore that this may have happened it is admitted ill be admitted he servants overheard it e can make no reservation there difference of opinion an altercation even took place between hugo and clara that evening he started suddenly why it was only last night t seems like ages n altercation about the children schooling clara held strong views on the subject of the children er eyes blinked hard which hugo did not share we throw out the hint then that clara during the course of the dispute e must call it a dispute took up this dagger and toyed with it you know her habit of toying when she had no knitting or needlework in the course of playing with it we sugges she tried to pull the knife out of its sheath failed held it up so point upward pulled again pulled harder ith a jerk at last the sheath came off the dagger sprang up it wounded clara fatally hugo knowing that they had disagreed knowing that the servants had heard and seeing her fall suddenly dead before him was seized with horror he le geyt impulsiveness ost his head rushed out fancied the accident would be mistaken for murder but why a q don you know recently married most attached to his wife it is plausible isn it so plausible i answered looking it straight in the face that it has but one weak point we might make a coroner jury or even a common jury accept it on sebastian expert evidence sebastian can work wonders but we could never make hilda wade finished the sentence for me as i paused hugo le geyt consent to advance it i lowered my head you have said it i answered not for the children sake mrs mallet cried with clasped hands not for the children sake even i answered consider for a moment mrs mallet is it true do you yourself believe it she threw herself back in her chair with a dejected face oh as for that she cried wearily crossing her hands before you and hilda who know all what need to prevaricate how can i believe it we understand how it came about that woman that woman the real wonder is hilda murmured soothing her white hand that he contained himself so long well we all know hugo i went on as quietly as i was able and knowing hugo we know that he might be urged to commit this wild act in a fierce moment of indignation ighteous indignation on behalf of his motherless girls under tremendous provocation but we also know that having once committed it he would never stoop to disown it by a subterfuge the heartroken sister let her head drop faintly so hilda told me she murmured and what hilda says in these matters is almost always final we debated the question for some minutes more then mrs mallet cried at last at any rate he has fled for the moment and his flight alone brings the worst suspicion upon him that is our chief point we must find out where he is and if he has gone right away we must bring him back to london where do you think he has taken refuge the police dr sebastian has ascertained are watching the railway stations and the ports for the continent very like the police hilda exclaimed with more than a touch of contempt in her voice as if a clever manfheorld like hugo le geyt would run away by rail or start off to the continent every englishman is noticeable on the continent it would be sheer madness you think he has not gone there then i cried deeply interested of course not that is the point i hinted at just now he has defended many persons accused of murder and he often spoke to me of their incredible folly when trying to escape in going by rail or in setting out from england for paris an englishman he used to say is least observed in his own country in this case i think i know where he has gone how he went there where then where comes last how first it is a question of inference explain we know your powers well i take it for granted that he killed her e must not mince matters bout twelve olock for after that hour the servants told lina there was quiet in the drawingoom next i conjecture he went upstairs to change his clothes he could not go forth on the world in an evening suit and the housemaid says his black coat and trousers were lying as usual on a chair in his dressingoom hich shows at least that he was not unduly flurried after that he put on another suit no doubt hat suit i hope the police will not discover too soon for i suppose you must just accept the situation that we are conspiring to defeat the ends of justice no no mrs mallet cried to bring him back voluntarily that he may face his trial like a man yes dear that is quite right however the next thing of course would be that he would shave in whole or in part his big black beard was so very conspicuous he would certainly get rid of that before attempting to escape the servants being in bed he was not pressed for time he had the whole night before him so of course he shaved on the other hand the police you may be sure will circulate his photograph e must not shirk these points or mrs mallet winced again will circulate his photograph beard and all and that will really be one of our great safeguards for the bushy beard so masks the face that without it hugo would be scarcely recognisable i conclude therefore that he must have shorn himself before leaving home though naturally i did not make the police a present of the hint by getting lina to ask any questions in that direction of the housemaid you are probably right i answered but would he have a razor i was coming to that no certainly he would not he had not shaved for years and they kept no menervants which makes it difficult for him to borrow one from a sleeping man so what he would do would doubtless be to cut off his beard or part of it quite close with a pair of scissors and then get himself properly shaved next morning in the first country town he came to the first country town certainly that leads up to the next point we must try to be cool and collected she was quivering with suppressed emotion herself as she said it but her soothing hand still lay on mrs mallet the next thing is e would leave london but not by rail you say he is an intelligent man and in the course of defending others has thought about this matter why expose himself to the needless risk and observation of a railway station no i saw at once what he would do beyond doubt he would cycle he always wondered it was not done oftener under similar circumstances but has his bicycle gone lina looked it has not i should have expected as much i told her to note that point very unobtrusively so as to avoid giving the police the clue she saw the machine in the outer hall as usual he is too good a criminal lawyer to have dreamt of taking his own mrs mallet interposed with another effort but where could he have hired or bought one at that time of night i exclaimed nowhere ithout exciting the gravest suspicion therefore i conclude he stopped in london for the night sleeping at an hotel without luggage and paying for his room in advance it is frequently done and if he arrived late very little notice would be taken of him big hotels about the strand i am told have always a dozen such casual bachelor guests every evening and then and then this morning he would buy a new bicycle different make from his own at the nearest shop would rig himself out at some readyade tailor with a fresh tourist suit robably an ostentatiously tweedy bicycling suit and with that in his luggagearrier would make straight on his machine for the country he could change in some copse and bury his own clothes avoiding the blunders he has seen in others perhaps he might ride for the first twenty or thirty miles out of london to some minor sidetation and then go on by train towards his destination quitting the rail again at some unimportant point where the main west road crosses the great western or the southestern line great western or southestern why those two in particular then you have settled in your own mind which direction he has taken pretty well i judge by analogy lina your brother was brought up in the west country was he not mrs mallet gave a weary nod in north devon she answered on the wild stretch of moor about hartland and clovelly hilda wade seemed to collect herself now mr le geyt is essentially a celt celt in temperament she went on he comes by origin and ancestry from a rough heatherlad country he belongs to the moorland in other words his type is the mountaineer but a mountaineer instinct in similar circumstances is hat why to fly straight to his native mountains in an agony of terror in an access of despair when all else fails he strikes a beeine for the hills he loves rationally or irrationally he seems to think he can hide there hugo le geyt with his frank boyish nature his great devonian frame is sure to have done so i know his mood he has made for the west country you are right hilda mrs mallet exclaimed with conviction i quite sure from what i know of hugo that to go to the west would be his first impulse and the le geyts are always governed by first impulses my charactereader added she was quite correct from the time we two were at oxford together as an undergraduate he as a don had always noticed that marked trait in my dear old friend temperament after a short pause hilda broke the silence again the sea again the sea the le geyts love the water was there any place on the sea where he went much as a boy ny lonely place i mean in that north devon district mrs mallet reflected a moment yes there was a little bay mere gap in high cliffs with some fishermen huts and a few yards of beach here he used to spend much of his holidays it was a weirdooking break in a grim seaall of darked rocks where the tide rose high rolling in from the atlantic the very thing has he visited it since he grew up to my knowledge never hilda voice had a ring of certainty then that is where we shall find him dear we must look there first he is sure to revisit just such a solitary spot by the sea when trouble overtakes him later in the evening as we were walking home towards nathaniel together i asked hilda why she had spoken throughout with such unwavering confidence oh it was simple enough she answered there were two things that helped me through which i didn like to mention in detail before lina one was this the le geyts have all of them an instinctive horror of the sight of blood therefore they almost never commit suicide by shooting themselves or cutting their throats marcus who shot himself in the gunoom was an exception to both rules he never minded blood he could cut up a deer but hugo refused to be a doctor because he could not stand the sight of an operation and even as a sportsman he never liked to pick up or handle the game he had shot himself he said it sickened him he rushed from that room last night i feel sure in a physical horror at the deed he had done and by now he is as far as he can get from london the sight of his act drove him away not craven fear of an arrest if the le geyts kill themselves seafaring race on the whole heir impulse is to trust to water and the other thing well that was about the mountaineer homing instinct i have often noticed it i could give you fifty instances only i didn like to speak of them before lina there was williams for example the dolgelly man who killed a gameeeper at petworth in a poaching affray he was taken on cader idris skulking among rocks a week later then there was that unhappy young fellow mackinnon who shot his sweetheart at leicester he made straight as the crow flies for his home in the isle of skye and there drowned himself in familiar waters lindner the tyrolese again who stabbed the american swindler at monte carlo was tracked after a few days to his native place st valentin in the zillerthal it is always so mountaineers in distress fly to their mountains it is a part of their nostalgia i know it from within too if i were in poor hugo legeyt place what do you think i would do why hide myself at once in the greenest recesses of our carnarvonshire mountains what an extraordinary insight into character you have i cried you seem to divine what everybody action will be under given circumstances she paused and held her parasol half poised in her hand character determines action she said slowly at last that is the secret of the great novelists they put themselves behind and within their characters and so make us feel that every act of their personages is not only natural but even iven the conditions nevitable we recognise that their story is the sole logical outcome of the interaction of their dramatis personae now i am not a great novelist i cannot create and imagine characters and situations but i have something of the novelist gift i apply the same method to the real life of the people around me i try to throw myself into the person of others and to feel how their character will compel them to act in each set of circumstances to which they may expose themselves in one word i said you are a psychologist a psychologist she assented i suppose so and the police ell the police are not they are at best but bungling materialists they require a clue what need of a clue if you can interpret character so certain was hilda wade of her conclusions indeed that mrs mallet begged me next day to take my holiday at once hich i could easily do nd go down to the little bay in the hartland district of which she had spoken in search of hugo i consented she herself proposed to set out quietly for bideford where she could be within easy reach of me in order to hear of my success or failure while hilda wade whose summer vacation was to have begun in two days time offered to ask for an extra day leave so as to accompany her the brokenearted sister accepted the offer and secrecy being above all things necessary we set off by different routes the two women by waterloo myself by paddington we stopped that night at different hotels in bideford but next morning hilda rode out on her bicycle and accompanied me on mine for a mile or two along the tortuous way towards hartland take nothing for granted she said as we parted and be prepared to find poor hugo le geyt appearance greatly changed he has eluded the police and their lues so far therefore i imagine he must have largely altered his dress and exterior i will find him i answered if he is anywhere within twenty miles of hartland she waved her hand to me in farewell i rode on after she left me towards the high promontory in front the wildest and leastisited part of north devon torrents of rain had fallen during the night the slimy cartuts and cattleracks on the moor were brimming with water it was a lowering day the clouds drifted low black peatogs filled the hollows grey stone homesteads lonely and forbidding stood out here and there against the curved skyine even the high road was uneven and in places flooded for an hour i passed hardly a soul at last near a crossroad with a defaced fingerost i descended from my machine and consulted my ordnance map on which mrs mallet had marked ominously with a cross of red rink the exact position of the little fishing hamlet where hugo used to spend his holidays i took the turning which seemed to me most likely to lead to it but the tracks were so confused and the run of the lanes so uncertain et alone the map being some years out of date hat i soon felt i had lost my bearings by a little wayside inn half hidden in a deep combe with bog on every side i descended and asked for a bottle of gingereer for the day was hot and close in spite of the packed clouds as they were opening the bottle i inquired casually the way to the red gap bathinglace the landlord gave me directions which confused me worse than ever ending at last with the concise remark an then zur two or dree more turns to the right an to the left bring e right up alongzide o ut i despaired of finding the way by these unintelligible sailingrders but just at that moment as luck would have it another cyclist flew past he first soul i had seen on the road that morning he was a man with the loosenit air of a shop assistant badly got up in a rather loud and obtrusive tourist suit of brown homespun with baggy knickerbockers and thin thread stockings i judged him a gentleman on the cheap at sight very stylish this suit complete only thirtyeven and sixpence the landlady glanced out at him with a friendly nod he turned and smiled at her but did not see me for i stood in the shade behind the halfpen door he had a short black moustache and a not unpleasing careless face his features i thought were better than his garments however the stranger did not interest me just then i was far too full of more important matters why don e taake an vollow thik ther geneman zur the landlady said pointing one large red hand after him ur do go down to urd gap to zwim every marnin mr jan smith o oxford they do call un e can go wrong if e do vollow un to the gap ur lodgin up to wold varmer moore an ur that vond o the zay the vishermen do tell me as wasn never any geneman like un i tossed off my gingereer jumped on to my machine and followed the retreating brown back of mr john smith of oxford urely a most nonommitting name ound sharp corners and over rutty lanes tireeep in mud across the rustyed moor till all at once at a turn a gap of stormy sea appeared wedgehape between two shelving rockalls it was a lonely spot rocks hemmed it in big breakers walled it the sou ester roared through the gap i rode down among loose stones and waterorn channels in the solid grit very carefully but the man in brown had torn over the wild path with reckless haste zigzagging madly and was now on the little threeornered patch of beach undressing himself with a sort of careless glee and flinging his clothes down anyhow on the shingle beside him something about the action caught my eye that movement of the arm it was not t could not be o no not hugo a very ordinary person and le geyt bore the stamp of a born gentleman he stood up bare at last he flung out his arms as if to welcome the boisterous wind to his naked bosom then with a sudden burst of recognition the man stood revealed we had bathed together a hundred times in london and elsewhere the face the clad figure the dress all were different but the body he actual frame and make of the man he wellnit limbs the splendid trunk o disguise could alter it was le geyt himself ig powerful vigorous that illade suit those baggy knickerbockers the slouched cap the thin thread stockings had only distorted and hidden his figure now that i saw him as he was he came out the same bold and manly form as ever he did not notice me he rushed down with a certain wild joy into the turbulent water and plunging in with a loud cry buffeted the huge waves with those strong curving arms of his the sou ester was rising each breaker as it reared caught him on its crest and tumbled him over like a cork but like a cork he rose again he was swimming now arm over arm straight out seaward i saw the lifted hands between the crest and the trough for a moment i hesitated whether i ought to strip and follow him was he doing as so many others of his house had done ourting death from the water but some strange hand restrained me who was i that i should stand between hugo le geyt and the ways of providence the le geyts loved ever the ordeal by water presently he turned again before he turned i had taken the opportunity to look hastily at his clothes hilda wade had surmised aright once more the outer suit was a cheap affair from a big readyade tailor in st martin lane urned out by the thousand the underclothing on the other hand was new and unmarked but fine in quality ought no doubt at bideford an sense of doom stole over me i felt the end was near i withdrew behind a big rock and waited there unseen till hugo had landed he began to dress again without troubling to dry himself i drew a deep breath of relief then this was not suicide by the time he had pulled on his vest and drawers i came out suddenly from my ambush and faced him a fresh shock awaited me i could hardly believe my eyes it was not le geyt o nor anything like him nevertheless the man rose with a little cry and advanced half crouching towards me you are not hunting me down ith the police he exclaimed his neck held low and his forehead wrinkling the voice he voice was le geyt it was an unspeakable mystery hugo i cried dear hugo unting you down ould you imagine it he raised his head strode forward and grasped my hand forgive me cumberledge he cried but a proscribed and hounded man if you knew what a relief it is to me to get out on the water you forget all there i forget it he red horror you meant just now to drown yourself no if i had meant it i would have done it hubert for my children sake i will not commit suicide then listen i cried i told him in a few words of his sister scheme ebastian defence he plausibility of the explanation he whole long story he gazed at me moodily yet it was not hugo no no he said shortly and as he spoke it was he i have done it i have killed her i will not owe my life to a falsehood not for the children sake he dashed his hand down impatiently i have a better way for the children i will save them still hubert you are not afraid to speak to a murderer dear hugo know all and to know all is to forgive all he grasped my hand once more know all he cried with a despairing gesture oh no no one knows all but myself not even the children but the children know much they will forgive me lina knows something she will forgive me you know a little you forgive me the world can never know it will brand my darlings as a murderer children it was the act of a minute i interposed and hough she is dead poor lady and one must speak no ill of her e can at least gather dimly for your children sake how deep was the provocation he gazed at me fixedly his voice was like lead for the children sake es he answered as in a dream it was all for the children i have killed her urdered her he has paid her penalty and poor dead soul i will utter no word against her he woman i have murdered but one thing i will say if omniscient justice sends me for this to eternal punishment i can endure it gladly like a man knowing that so i have redeemed my marian motherless girls from a deadly tyranny it was the only sentence in which he ever alluded to her i sat down by his side and watched him closely mechanically methodically he went on with his dressing the more he dressed the less could i believe it was hugo i had expected to find him closehaven so did the police by their printed notices instead of that he had shaved his beard and whiskers but only trimmed his moustache trimmed it quite short so as to reveal the boyish corners of the mouth trick which entirely altered his rugged expression but that was not all what puzzled me most was the eyes hey were not hugo at first i could not imagine why by degrees the truth dawned upon me his eyebrows were naturally thick and shaggy reat overhanging growth interspersed with many of those stiff long hairs to which darwin called attention in certain men as surviving traits from a monkeyike ancestor in order to disguise himself hugo had pulled out all these coarser hairs leaving nothing on his brows but the soft and closely pressed coat of down which underlies the longer bristles in all such cases this had wholly altered the expression of the eyes which no longer looked out keenly from their cavernous penthouse but being deprived of their relief had acquired a much more ordinary and less individual aspect from a goodatured but shaggy giant my old friend was transformed by his shaving and his costume into a welled and wellrown but not very colossal commercial gentleman hugo was scarcely six feet high indeed though by his broad shoulders and bushy beard he had always impressed one with such a sense of size and now that the hirsuteness had been got rid of and the dress altered he hardly struck one as taller or bigger than the average of his fellows we sat for some minutes and talked le geyt would not speak of clara and when i asked him his intentions he shook his head moodily i shall act for the best he said what of best is left o guard the dear children it was a terrible price to pay for their redemption but it was the only one possible and in a moment of wrath i paid it now i have to pay in turn myself i do not shirk it you will come back to london then and stand your trial i asked eagerly come back to london he cried with a face of white panic hitherto he had seemed to me rather relieved in expression than otherwise his countenance had lost its worn and anxious look he was no longer watching each moment over his children safety come back to london and face my trial why did you think hubert was the court or the hanging i was shirking no no not that but it he red horror i must get away from it to the sea o the water o wash away the stain s far from it hat red pool s possible i answered nothing i left him to face his own remorse in silence at last he rose to go and held one foot undecided on his bicycle i leave myself in heaven hands he said as he lingered it will requite the ordeal is by water so i judged i answered tell lina this from me he went on still loitering that if she will trust me i will strive to do the best that remains for my darlings i will do it heaven helping she will know what toorrow he mounted his machine and sailed off my eyes followed him up the path with sad forebodings all day long i loitered about the gap it consisted of two bays he one i had already seen and another divided from it by a sawdge of rock in the further cove crouched a few low stone cottages a broadottomed sailing boat lay there pulled up high on the beach about three olock as i sat and watched two men began to launch it the sea ran high tide coming in the sou ester still increasing in force to a gale at the signaltaff on the cliff the dangerone was hoisted white spray danced in air big black clouds rolled up seething from windward low thunder rumbling a storm threatened one of the men was le geyt the other a fisherman he jumped in and put off through the surf with an air of triumph he was a splendid sailor his boat leapt through the breakers and flew before the wind with a mere rag of canvas dangerous weather to be out i exclaimed to the fisherman who stood with hands buried in his pockets watching him ay that ur be zur the man answered doan like the look o ut but thik there geneman e one o oxford e do tell me and they a main venturesome lot they college volk e off by droo the starm all so var as lundy will he

the man who was wanted for the campden hill mystery was cast up by the waves on the shore of lundy the lord had decided hugo had not miscalculated luck in their suicides hilda wade said and strange to say the luck of the le geyts stood him in good stead still by a miracle of fate his children were not branded as a murderer daughters sebastian gave evidence at the inquest on the wife body selfnflicted recoil am sure of it his specialist knowledge is assertive certainty combined with that arrogant masterful manner of his and his keen eagle eye overbore the jury awed by the great man look they brought in a submissive verdict of death by misadventure the coroner thought it a most proper finding mrs mallet had made the most of the innate le geyt horror of blood the newspapers charitably surmised that the unhappy husband crazed by the instantaneous unexpectedness of his loss had wandered away like a madman to the scenes of his childhood and had there been drowned by accident while trying to cross a stormy sea to lundy under some wild impression that he would find his dead wife alive on the island nobody whispered murder everybody dwelt on the utter absence of motive model husband uch a charming young wife and such a devoted stepmother we three alone knew e three and the children on the day when the jury brought in their verdict at the adjourned inquest on mrs le geyt hilda wade stood in the room trembling and whiteaced awaiting their decision when the foreman uttered the words death by misadventure she burst into tears of relief he did well she cried to me passionately he did well that poor father he placed his life in the hands of his maker asking only for mercy to his innocent children and mercy has been shown to him and to them he was taken gently in the way he wished it would have broken my heart for those two poor girls if the verdict had gone otherwise he knew how terrible a lot it is to be called a murderer daughter i did not realise at the time with what profound depth of personal feeling she said it chapter the episode of the needle that did not match sebastian is a great man i said to hilda wade as i sat one afternoon over a cup of tea she had brewed for me in her own little sittingoom it is one of the alleviations of an hospital doctor lot that he may drink tea now and again with the sister of his ward whatever else you choose to think of him you must admit he is a very great man i admired our famous professor and i admired hilda wade was a matter of regret to me that my two admirations did not seem in return sufficiently to admire one another oh yes hilda answered pouring out my second cup he is a very great man i never denied that the greatest man on the whole i think that i have ever come across and he has done splendid work for humanity i went on growing enthusiastic splendid work yes splendid two lumps i believe he has done more i admit for medical science than any other man i ever met i gazed at her with a curious glance then why dear lady do you keep telling me he is cruel i inquired toasting my feet on the fender it seems contradictory she passed me the muffins and smiled her restrained smile does the desire to do good to humanity in itself imply a benevolent disposition she answered obliquely now you are talking in paradox surely if a man works all his life long for the good of mankind that shows he is devoured by sympathy for his species and when your friend mr bates works all his life long at observing and classifying ladyirds i suppose that shows he is devoured by sympathy for the race of beetles i laughed at her comical face she looked at me so quizzically but then i objected the cases are not parallel bates kills and collects his ladyirds sebastian cures and benefits humanity hilda smiled her wise smile once more and fingered her apron are the cases so different as you suppose she went on with her quick glance is it not partly accident a man of science you see early in life takes up half by chance this that or the other particular form of study but what the study is in itself i fancy does not greatly matter do not mere circumstances as often as not determine it surely it is the temperament on the whole that tells the temperament that is or is not scientific how do you mean you are so enigmatic well in a family of the scientific temperament it seems to me one brother may happen to go in for butterflies ay he not nd another for geology or for submarine telegraphs now the man who happens to take up butterflies does not make a fortune out of his hobby here is no money in butterflies so we say accordingly he is an unpractical person who cares nothing for business and who is only happy when he is out in the fields with a net chasing emperors and tortoisehells but the man who happens to fancy submarine telegraphy most likely invents a lot of new improvements takes out dozens of patents finds money flow in upon him as he sits in his study and becomes at last a peer and a millionaire so then we say what a splendid business head he has got to be sure and how immensely he differs from his poor woolathering brother the entomologist who can only invent new ways of hatching out wireorms yet all may really depend on the first chance direction which led one brother as a boy to buy a butterfly net and sent the other into the school laboratory to dabble with an electric wheel and a cheap battery then you mean to say it is chance that has made sebastian hilda shook her pretty head by no means don be so stupid we both know sebastian has a wonderful brain whatever was the work he undertook with that brain in science he would carry it out consummately he is a born thinker it is like this don you know she tried to arrange her thoughts the particular branch of science to which mr hiram maxim mind happens to have been directed was the making of machineuns nd he slays his thousands the particular branch to which sebastian mind happens to have been directed was medicine nd he cures as many as mr maxim kills it is a turn of the hand that makes all the difference i see i said the aim of medicine happens to be a benevolent one quite so that just what i mean the aim is benevolent and sebastian pursues that aim with the singleinded energy of a lofty gifted and devoted nature ut not a good one not good oh no to be quite frank he seems to me to pursue it ruthlessly cruelly unscrupulously he is a man of high ideals but without principle in that respect he reminds one of the great spirits of the italian renaissance envenuto cellini and so forth en who could pore for hours with conscientious artistic care over the detail of a hem in a sculptured robe yet could steal out in the midst of their disinterested toil to plunge a knife in the back of a rival sebastian would not do that i cried he is wholly free from the mean spirit of jealousy no sebastian would not do that you are quite right there there is no tinge of meanness in the man nature he likes to be first in the field but he would acclaim with delight another man scientific triumph f another anticipated him for would it not mean a triumph for universal science nd is not the advancement of science sebastian religion but he would do almost as much or more he would stab a man without remorse if he thought that by stabbing him he could advance knowledge i recognised at once the truth of her diagnosis nurse wade i cried you are a wonderful woman i believe you are right but ow did you come to think of it a cloud passed over her brow i have reason to know it she answered slowly then her voice changed take another muffin i helped myself and paused i laid down my cup and gazed at her what a beautiful tender sympathetic face and yet how able she stirred the fire uneasily i looked and hesitated i had often wondered why i never dared ask hilda wade one question that was nearest my heart i think it must have been because i respected her so profoundly the deeper your admiration and respect for a woman the harder you find it in the end to ask her at last i almost made up my mind i cannot think i began what can have induced a girl like you with means and friends with brains and drew back then i plumped it out beauty to take to such a life as this life which seems in many ways so unworthy of you she stirred the fire more pensively than ever and rearranged the muffinish on the little wroughtron stand in font of the grate and yet she murmured looking down what life can be better than the service of one kind you think it a great life for sebastian sebastian he is a man that is different quite different but a woman especially you dear lady for whom one feels that nothing is quite high enough quite pure enough quite good enough i cannot imagine how she checked me with one wave of her gracious hand her movements were always slow and dignified i have a plan in my life she answered earnestly her eyes meeting mine with a sincere frank gaze a plan to which i have resolved to sacrifice everything it absorbs my being till that plan is fulfilled i saw the tears were gathering fast on her lashes she suppressed them with an effort say no more she added faltering infirm of purpose i will not listen i leant forward eagerly pressing my advantage the air was electric waves of emotion passed to and fro but surely i cried you do not mean to say she waved me aside once more i will not put my hand to the plough and then look back she answered firmly dr cumberledge spare me i came to nathaniel for a purpose i told you at the time what that purpose was n part to be near sebastian i want to be near him for an object i have at heart do not ask me to reveal it do not ask me to forego it i am a woman therefore weak but i need your aid help me instead of hindering me hilda i cried leaning forward with quiverings of my heart i will help you in whatever way you will allow me but let me at any rate help you with the feeling that i am helping one who means in time at that moment as unkindly fate would have it the door opened and sebastian entered nurse wade he began in his iron voice glancing about him with stern eyes where are those needles i ordered for that operation we must be ready in time before nielsen comes cumberledge i shall want you the golden opportunity had come and gone it was long before i found a similar occasion for speaking to hilda every day after that the feeling deepened upon me that hilda was there to watch sebastian why i did not know but it was growing certain that a lifeong duel was in progress between these two duel of some strange and mysterious import the first approach to a solution of the problem which i obtained came a week or two later sebastian was engaged in observing a case where certain unusual symptoms had suddenly supervened it was a case of some obscure affection of the heart i will not trouble you here with the particular details we all suspected a tendency to aneurism hilda wade was in attendance as she always was on sebastian observation cases we crowded round watching the professor himself leaned over the cot with some medicine for external application in a basin he gave it to hilda to hold i noticed that as she held it her fingers trembled and that her eyes were fixed harder than ever upon sebastian he turned round to his students now this he began in a very unconcerned voice as if the patient were a toad is a most unwonted turn for the disease to take it occurs very seldom in point of fact i have only observed the symptom once before and then it was fatal the patient in that instance e paused dramatically was the notorious poisoner dr yorkeannerman as he uttered the words hilda wade hands trembled more than ever and with a little scream she let the basin fall breaking it into fragments sebastian keen eyes had transfixed her in a second how did you manage to do that he asked with quiet sarcasm but in a tone full of meaning the basin was heavy hilda faltered my hands were trembling nd it somehow slipped through them i am not quite myself not quite well this afternoon i ought not to have attempted it the professor deepet eyes peered out like gleaming lights from beneath their overhanging brows no you ought not to have attempted it he answered withering her with a glance you might have let the thing fall on the patient and killed him as it is can you see you have agitated him with the flurry don stand there holding your breath woman repair your mischief get a cloth and wipe it up and give me the bottle with skilful haste he administered a little sal volatile and nux vomica to the swooning patient while hilda set about remedying the damage that better sebastian said in a mollified tone when she had brought another basin there was a singular note of cloaked triumph in his voice now wel begin again i was just saying gentlemen before this accident that i had seen only one case of this peculiar form of the tendency before and that case was the notorious e kept his glittering eyes fixed harder on hilda than ever the notorious dr yorkeannerman i was watching hilda too at the words she trembled violently all over once more but with an effort restrained herself their looks met in a searching glance hilda air was proud and fearless in sebastian i fancied i detected after a second just a tinge of wavering you remember yorkeannerman case he went on he committed a murder let me take the basin i cried for i saw hilda hands giving way a second time and i was anxious to spare her no thank you she answered low but in a voice that was full of suppressed defiance i will wait and hear this out i prefer to stop here as for sebastian he seemed now not to notice her though i was aware all the time of a sidelong glance of his eye parrotise in her direction he committed a murder he went on by means of aconitine hen an almost unknown poison and after committing it his heart being already weak he was taken himself with symptoms of aneurism in a curious form essentially similar to these so that he died before the trial lucky escape for him he paused rhetorically once more then he added in the same tone mental agitation and the terror of detection no doubt accelerated the fatal result in that instance he died at once from the shock of the arrest it was a natural conclusion here we may hope for a more successful issue he spoke to the students of course but i could see for all that that he was keeping his falcon eye fixed hard on hilda face i glanced aside at her she never flinched for a second neither said anything directly to the other still by their eyes and mouths i knew some strange passage of arms had taken place between them sebastian tone was one of provocation of defiance i might almost say of challenge hilda air i took rather for the air of calm and resolute but assured resistance he expected her to answer she said nothing instead of that she went on holding the basin now with fingers that would not tremble every muscle was strained every tendon was strung i could see she held herself in with a will of iron the rest of the episode passed off quietly sebastian having delivered his bolt began to think less of hilda and more of the patient he went on with his demonstration as for hilda she gradually relaxed her muscles and with a deeprawn breath resumed her natural attitude the tension was over they had had their little skirmish whatever it might mean and had it out now they called a truce over the patient body when the case had been disposed of and the students dismissed i went straight into the laboratory to get a few surgical instruments i had chanced to leave there for a minute or two i mislaid my clinical thermometer and began hunting for it behind a wooden partition in the corner of the room by the place for washing testubes as i stooped down turning over the various objects about the tap in my search sebastian voice came to me he had paused outside the door and was speaking in his calm clear tone very low to hilda so now we understand one another nurse wade he said with a significant sneer i know whom i have to deal with and i know too hilda answered in a voice of placid confidence yet you are not afraid it is not i who have cause for fear the accused may tremble not the prosecutor what you threaten no i do not threaten not in words i mean my presence here is in itself a threat but i make no other you know now unfortunately why i have come that makes my task harder but i will not give it up i will wait and conquer sebastian answered nothing he strode into the laboratory alone tall grim unbending and let himself sink into his easy chair looking up with a singular and somewhat sinister smile at his bottles of microbes after a minute he stirred the fire and bent his head forward brooding he held it between his hands with his elbows on his knees and gazed moodily straight before him into the glowing caves of whiteot coal in the fireplace that sinister smile still played lambent around the corners of his grizzled moustaches i moved noiselessly towards the door trying to pass behind him unnoticed but alert as ever his quick ears detected me with a sudden start he raised his head and glanced round what you here he cried taken aback for a second he appeared almost to lose his selfossession i came for my clinical i answered with an unconcerned air i have somehow managed to mislay it in the laboratory my carefully casual tone seemed to reassure him he peered about him with knit brows cumberledge he asked at last in a suspicious voice did you hear that woman the woman in delirious no no nurse wade hear her i echoed i must candidly admit with intent to deceive when she broke the basin his forehead relaxed oh it is nothing he muttered hastily a mere point of discipline she spoke to me just now and i thought her tone unbecoming in a subordinate like korah and his crew she takes too much upon her we must get rid of her cumberledge we must get rid of her she is a dangerous woman she is the most intelligent nurse we have ever had in the place sir i objected stoutly he nodded his head twice intelligent e vous lccorde but dangerous angerous then he turned to his papers sorting them out one by one with a preoccupied face and twitching fingers i recognised that he desired to be left alone so i quitted the laboratory i cannot quite say why but ever since hilda wade first came to nathaniel my enthusiasm for sebastian had been cooling continuously admiring his greatness still i had doubts as to his goodness that day i felt i positively mistrusted him i wondered what his passage of arms with hilda might mean yet somehow i was shy of alluding to it before her one thing however was clear to me now his great campaign that was being waged between the nurse and the professor had reference to the case of dr yorkeannerman for a time nothing came of it the routine of the hospital went on as usual the patient with the suspected predisposition to aneurism kept fairly well for a week or two and then took a sudden turn for the worse presenting at times most unwonted symptoms he died unexpectedly sebastian who had watched him every hour regarded the matter as of prime importance i glad it happened here he said rubbing his hands a grand opportunity i wanted to catch an instance like this before that fellow in paris had time to anticipate me theye all on the lookout von strahlendorff of vienna has been waiting for just such a patient for years so have i now fortune has favoured me lucky for us he died we shall find out everything we held a postortem of course the condition of the blood being what we most wished to observe and the autopsy revealed some unexpected details one remarkable feature consisted in a certain undescribed and impoverished state of the contained bodies which sebastian with his eager zeal for science desired his students to see and identify he said it was likely to throw much light on other illnderstood conditions of the brain and nervous system as well as on the peculiar faint odour of the insane now so well recognised in all large asylums in order to compare this abnormal state with the aspect of the healthy circulating medium he proposed to examine a little good living blood side by side with the morbid specimen under the microscope nurse wade was in attendance in the laboratory as usual the professor standing by the instrument with one hand on the brass screw had got the diseased drop ready arranged for our inspection beforehand and was gloating over it himself with scientific enthusiasm grey corpuscles you will observe he said almost entirely deficient red poor in number and irregular in outline plasma thin nuclei feeble a state of body which tells severely against the due rebuilding of the wasted tissues now compare with typical normal specimen he removed his eye from the microscope and wiped a glass slide with a clean cloth as he spoke nurse wade we know of old the purity and vigour of your circulating fluid you shall have the honour of advancing science once more hold up your finger hilda held up her forefinger unhesitatingly she was used to such requests and indeed sebastian had acquired by long experience the faculty of pinching the fingerip so hard and pressing the point of a needle so dexterously into a minor vessel that he could draw at once a small drop of blood without the subject even feeling it the professor nipped the last joint between his finger and thumb for a moment till it was black at the end then he turned to the saucer at his side which hilda herself had placed there and chose from it catike with great deliberation and selective care a particular needle hilda eyes followed his every movement as closely and as fearlessly as ever sebastian hand was raised and he was just about to pierce the delicate white skin when with a sudden quick scream of terror she snatched her hand away hastily the professor let the needle drop in his astonishment what did you do that for he cried with an angry dart of the keen eyes this is not the first time i have drawn your blood you knew i would not hurt you hilda face had grown strangely pale but that was not all i believe i was the only person present who noticed one unobtrusive piece of sleightfand which she hurriedly and skilfully executed when the needle slipped from sebastian hand she leant forward even as she screamed and caught it unobserved in the folds of her apron then her nimble fingers closed over it as if by magic and conveyed it with a rapid movement at once to her pocket i do not think even sebastian himself noticed the quick forward jerk of her eager hands which would have done honour to a conjurer he was too much taken aback by her unexpected behaviour to observe the needle just as she caught it hilda answered his question in a somewhat flurried voice i was afraid she broke out gasping one gets these little accesses of terror now and again i feel rather weak i don think i will volunteer to supply any more normal blood this morning sebastian acute eyes read her through as so often with a trenchant dart he glanced from her to me i could see he began to suspect a confederacy that will do he went on with slow deliberateness better so nurse wade i don know what beginning to come over you you are losing your nerve hich is fatal in a nurse only the other day you let fall and broke a basin at a most critical moment and now you scream aloud on a trifling apprehension he paused and glanced around him mr callaghan he said turning to our tall redaired irish student your blood is good normal and you are not hysterical he selected another needle with studious care give me your finger as he picked out the needle i saw hilda lean forward again alert and watchful eyeing him with a piercing glance but after a second consideration she seemed to satisfy herself and fell back without a word i gathered that she was ready to interfere had occasion demanded but occasion did not demand and she held her peace quietly the rest of the examination proceeded without a hitch for a minute or two it is true i fancied that sebastian betrayed a certain suppressed agitation trifling lack of his accustomed perspicuity and his luminous exposition but after meandering for a while through a few vague sentences he soon recovered his wonted calm and as he went on with his demonstration throwing himself eagerly into the case his usual scientific enthusiasm came back to him undiminished he waxed eloquent after his fashio over the beautiful contrast between callaghan wholesome blood rich in the vivifying architectonic grey corpuscles which rebuild worn tissues and the effete impoverished unvitalised fluid which stagnated in the sluggish veins of the dead patient the carriers of oxygen had neglected their proper task the granules whose duty it was to bring elaborated foodtuffs to supply the waste of brain and nerve and muscle had forgotten their cunning the bricklayers of the bodily fabric had gone out on strike the weary scavengers had declined to remove the useless byroducts his vivid tongue his picturesque fancy ran away with him i had never heard him talk better or more incisively before one could feel sure as he spoke that the arteries of his own acute and teeming brain at that moment of exaltation were by no means deficient in those energetic and highly vital globules on whose reparative worth he so eloquently descanted sure the professor makes annywan see right inside wan own vascular system callaghan whispered aside to me in unfeigned admiration the demonstration ended in impressive silence as we streamed out of the laboratory aglow with his electric fire sebastian held me back with a bent motion of his shrivelled forefinger i stayed behind unwillingly yes sir i said in an interrogative voice the professor eyes were fixed intently on the ceiling his look was one of rapt inspiration i stood and waited cumberledge he said at last coming back to earth with a start i see it more plainly each day that goes we must get rid of that woman of nurse wade i asked catching my breath he roped the grizzled moustache and blinked the sunken eyes she has lost nerve he went on lost nerve entirely i shall suggest that she be dismissed her sudden failures of stamina are most embarrassing at critical junctures very well sir i answered swallowing a lump in my throat to say the truth i was beginning to be afraid on hilda account that morning events had thoroughly disquieted me he seemed relieved at my unquestioning acquiescence she is a dangerous edgedool that the truth of it he went on still twirling his moustache with a preoccupied air and turning over his stock of needles when she clothed and in her right mind she is a valuable accessory harp and trenchant like a clean bright lancet but when she allows one of these causeless hysterical fits to override her tone she plays one false at once ike a lancet that slips or grows dull and rusty he polished one of the needles on a soft square of new chamoiseather while he spoke as if to give point and illustration to his simile i went out from him much perturbed the sebastian i had once admired and worshipped was beginning to pass from me in his place i found a very complex and inferior creation my idol had feet of clay i was loth to acknowledge it i stalked along the corridor moodily towards my own room as i passed hilda wade door i saw it half ajar she stood a little within and beckoned me to enter i passed in and closed the door behind me hilda looked at me with trustful eyes resolute still her face was yet that of a hunted creature thank heaven i have one friend here at least she said slowly seating herself you saw me catch and conceal the needle yes i saw you she drew it forth from her purse carefully but loosely wrapped up in a small tag of tissueaper here it is she said displaying it now i want you to test it in a culture i asked for i guessed her meaning she nodded yes to see what that man has done to it what do you suspect she shrugged her graceful shoulders half imperceptibly how should i know anything i gazed at the needle closely what made you distrust it i inquired at last still eyeing it she opened a drawer and took out several others see here she said handing me one these are the needles i keep in antiseptic wool he needles with which i always supply the professor you observe their shape he common surgical patterns now look at this needle with which the professor was just going to prick my finger you can see for yourself at once it is of bluer steel and of a different manufacture that is quite true i answered examining it with my pocket lens which i always carry i see the difference but how did you detect it from his face partly but partly too from the needle itself i had my suspicions and i was watching him closely just as he raised the thing in his hand half concealing it so and showing only the point i caught the blue gleam of the steel as the light glanced off it it was not the kind i knew then i withdrew my hand at once feeling sure he meant mischief that was wonderfully quick of you quick well yes thank heaven my mind works fast my perceptions are rapid otherwise she looked grave one second more and it would have been too late the man might have killed me you think it is poisoned then hilda shook her head with confident dissent poisoned oh no he is wiser now fifteen years ago he used poison but science has made gigantic strides since then he would not needlessly expose himself toay to the risks of the poisoner fifteen years ago he used poison she nodded with the air of one who knows i am not speaking at random she answered i say what i know some day i will explain for the present it is enough to tell you i know it and what do you suspect now i asked the weird sense of her strange power deepening on me every second she held up the incriminated needle again do you see this groove she asked pointing to it with the tip of another i examined it once more at the light with the lens a longitudinal groove apparently ground into one side of the needle lengthwise by means of a small grindingtone and emery powder ran for a quarter of an inch above the point this groove seemed to me to have been produced by an amateur though he must have been one accustomed to delicate microscopic manipulation for the edges under the lens showed slightly rough like the surface of a file on a small scale not smooth and polished as a needleaker would have left them i said so to hilda you are quite right she answered that is just what it shows i feel sure sebastian made that groove himself he could have bought grooved needles it is true such as they sometimes use for retaining small quantities of lymphs and medicines but we had none in stock and to buy them would be to manufacture evidence against himself in case of detection besides the rough jagged edge would hold the material he wished to inject all the better while its sawike points would tear the flesh imperceptibly but minutely and so serve his purpose which was try the needle and judge for yourself i prefer you should find out you can tell me toorrow it was quick of you to detect it i cried still turning the suspicious object over the difference is so slight yes but you tell me my eyes are as sharp as the needle besides i had reason to doubt and sebastian himself gave me the clue by selecting his instrument with too great deliberation he had put it there with the rest but it lay a little apart and as he picked it up gingerly i began to doubt when i saw the blue gleam my doubt was at once converted into certainty then his eyes too had the look which i know means victory benign or baleful it goes with his triumphs i have seen that look before and when once it lurks scintillating in the luminous depths of his gleaming eyeballs i recognise at once that whatever his aim he has succeeded in it still hilda i am loth she waved her hand impatiently waste no time she cried in an authoritative voice if you happen to let that needle rub carelessly against the sleeve of your coat you may destroy the evidence take it at once to your room plunge it into a culture and lock it up safe at a proper temperature here sebastian cannot get at it ill the consequences develop i did as she bid me by this time i was not wholly unprepared for the result she anticipated my belief in sebastian had sunk to zero and was rapidly reaching a negative quantity at nine the next morning i tested one drop of the culture under the microscope clear and limpid to the naked eye it was alive with small objects of a most suspicious nature when properly magnified i knew those hungry forms still i would not decide offhand on my own authority in a matter of such moment sebastian character was at stake he character of the man who led the profession i called in callaghan who happened to be in the ward and asked him to put his eye to the instrument for a moment he was a splendid fellow for the use of high powers and i had magnified the culture diameters what do you call those i asked breathless he scanned them carefully with his experienced eye is it the microbes ye mean he answered an what they be then if it wasn the bacillus of pyaemia bloodoisoning i ejaculated horrortruck aye bloodoisoning that the english of it i assumed an air of indifference i made them that myself i rejoined as if they were mere ordinary experimental germs but i wanted confirmation of my own opinion youe sure of the bacillus an haven i been keeping swarms of those very same bacteria under close observation for sebastian for seven weeks past why i know them as well as i know me own mother thank you i said that will do and i carried off the microscope bacilli and all into hilda wade sittingoom look yourself i cried to her she stared at them through the instrument with an unmoved face i thought so she answered shortly the bacillus of pyaemia a most virulent type exactly what i expected you anticipated that result absolutely you see bloodoisoning matures quickly and kills almost to a certainty delirium supervenes so soon that the patient has no chance of explaining suspicions besides it would all seem so very natural everybody would say he got some slight wound which microbes from some case she was attending contaminated you may be sure sebastian thought out all that he plans with consummate skill he had designed everything i
