least guess at the real particulars of it all that ran in his brain was that i had another husband alive which i could not say in fact might not be true but i assured him however there was not the least of that in it and indeed as to my other husband he was effectually dead in law to me and had told me i should look on him as such so i had not the least uneasiness on that score but now i found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer and my husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease myself of the secret much to my satisfaction he had laboured with me three or four weeks but to no purpose only to tell him whether i had spoken these words only as the effect of my passion to put him in a passion or whether there was anything of truth in the bottom of them but i continued inflexible and would explain nothing unless he would first consent to my going to england which he would never do he said while he lived on the other hand i said it was in my power to make him willing when i pleased nay to make him entreat me to go and this increased his curiosity and made him importunate to the highest degree but it was all to no purpose at length he tells all this story to his mother and sets her upon me to get the main secret out of me and she used her utmost skill with me indeed but i put her to a full stop at once by telling her that the reason and mystery of the whole matter lay in herself and that it was my respect to her that had made me conceal it and that in short i could go no farther and therefore conjured her not to insist upon it she was struck dumb at this suggestion and could not tell what to say or to think but laying aside the supposition as a policy of mine continued her importunity on account of her son and if possible to make up the breach between us two as to that i told her that it was indeed a good design in her but that it was impossible to be done and that if i should reveal to her the truth of what she desired she would grant it to be impossible and cease to desire it at last i seemed to be prevailed on by her importunity and told her i dared trust her with a secret of the greatest importance and she would soon see that this was so and that i would consent to lodge it in her breast if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my consent she was long in promising this part but rather than not come at the main secret she agreed to that too and after a great many other preliminaries i began and told her the whole story first i told her how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened between her son and me by telling me her own story and her london name and that the surprise she saw i was in was upon that occasion then i told her my own story and my name and assured her by such other tokens as she could not deny that i was no other nor more or less than her own child her daughter born of her body in newgate the same that had saved her from the gallows by being in her belly and the same that she left in suchnduch hands when she was transported it is impossible to express the astonishment she was in she was not inclined to believe the story or to remember the particulars for she immediately foresaw the confusion that must follow in the family upon it but everything concurred so exactly with the stories she had told me of herself and which if she had not told me she would perhaps have been content to have denied that she had stopped her own mouth and she had nothing to do but to take me about the neck and kiss me and cry most vehemently over me without speaking one word for a long time together at last she broke out unhappy child says she what miserable chance could bring thee hither and in the arms of my own son too dreadful girl says she why we are all undone married to thy own brother three children and two alive all of the same flesh and blood my son and my daughter lying together as husband and wife all confusion and distraction for ever miserable family what will become of us what is to be said what is to be done and thus she ran on for a great while nor had i any power to speak or if i had did i know what to say for every word wounded me to the soul with this kind of amazement on our thoughts we parted for the first time though my mother was more surprised than i was because it was more news to her than to me however she promised again to me at parting that she would say nothing of it to her son till we had talked of it again it was not long you may be sure before we had a second conference upon the same subject when as if she had been willing to forget the story she had told me of herself or to suppose that i had forgot some of the particulars she began to tell them with alterations and omissions but i refreshed her memory and set her to rights in many things which i supposed she had forgot and then came in so opportunely with the whole history that it was impossible for her to go from it and then she fell into her rhapsodies again and exclamations at the severity of her misfortunes when these things were a little over with her we fell into a close debate about what should be first done before we gave an account of the matter to my husband but to what purpose could be all our consultations we could neither of us see our way through it nor see how it could be safe to open such a scene to him it was impossible to make any judgment or give any guess at what temper he would receive it in or what measures he would take upon it and if he should have so little government of himself as to make it public we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole family and expose my mother and me to the last degree and if at last he should take the advantage the law would give him he might put me away with disdain and leave me to sue for the little portion that i had and perhaps waste it all in the suit and then be a beggar the children would be ruined too having no legal claim to any of his effects and thus i should see him perhaps in the arms of another wife in a few months and be myself the most miserable creature alive my mother was as sensible of this as i and upon the whole we knew not what to do after some time we came to more sober resolutions but then it was with this misfortune too that my mother s opinion and mine were quite different from one another and indeed inconsistent with one another for my mother s opinion was that i should bury the whole thing entirely and continue to live with him as my husband till some other event should make the discovery of it more convenient and that in the meantime she would endeavour to reconcile us together again and restore our mutual comfort and family peace that we might lie as we used to do together and so let the whole matter remain a secret as close as death for child says she we are both undone if it comes out to encourage me to this she promised to make me easy in my circumstances as far as she was able and to leave me what she could at her death secured for me separately from my husband so that if it should come out afterwards i should not be left destitute but be able to stand on my own feet and procure justice from him this proposal did not agree at all with my judgment of the thing though it was very fair and kind in my mother but my thoughts ran quite another way as to keeping the thing in our own breasts and letting it all remain as it was i told her it was impossible and i asked her how she could think i could bear the thoughts of lying with my own brother in the next place i told her that her being alive was the only support of the discovery and that while she owned me for her child and saw reason to be satisfied that i was so nobody else would doubt it but that if she should die before the discovery i should be taken for an impudent creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband or should be counted crazed and distracted then i told her how he had threatened already to put me into a madhouse and what concern i had been in about it and how that was the thing that drove me to the necessity of discovering it to her as i had done from all which i told her that i had on the most serious reflections i was able to make in the case come to this resolution which i hoped she would like as a medium between both viz that she should use her endeavours with her son to give me leave to go to england as i had desired and to furnish me with a sufficient sum of money either in goods along with me or in bills for my support there all along suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over to me that when i was gone she should then in cold blood and after first obliging him in the solemnest manner possible to secrecy discover the case to him doing it gradually and as her own discretion should guide her so that he might not be surprised with it and fly out into any passions and excesses on my account or on hers and that she should concern herself to prevent his slighting the children or marrying again unless he had a certain account of my being dead this was my scheme and my reasons were good i was really alienated from him in the consequences of these things indeed i mortally hated him as a husband and it was impossible to remove that riveted aversion i had to him at the same time it being an unlawful incestuous living added to that aversion and though i had no great concern about it in point of conscience yet everything added to make cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing to me in the world and i think verily it was come to such a height that i could almost as willingly have embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me for which reason i could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets with him i cannot say that i was right in point of policy in carrying it such a length while at the same time i did not resolve to discover the thing to him but i am giving an account of what was not of what ought or ought not to be in their directly opposite opinion to one another my mother and i continued a long time and it was impossible to reconcile our judgments many disputes we had about it but we could never either of us yield our own or bring over the other i insisted on my aversion to lying with my own brother and she insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going from him to england and in this uncertainty we continued not differing so as to quarrel or anything like it but so as not to be able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach that was before us at last i resolved on a desperate course and told my mother my resolution viz that in short i would tell him of it myself my mother was frighted to the last degree at the very thoughts of it but i bid her be easy told her i would do it gradually and softly and with all the art and goodumour i was mistress of and time it also as well as i could taking him in goodumour too i told her i did not question but if i could be hypocrite enough to feign more affection to him than i really had i should succeed in all my design and we might part by consent and with a good agreement for i might live him well enough for a brother though i could not for a husband all this while he lay at my mother to find out if possible what was the meaning of that dreadful expression of mine as he called it which i mentioned before namely that i was not his lawful wife nor my children his legal children my mother put him off told him she could bring me to no explanations but found there was something that disturbed me very much and she hoped she should get it out of me in time and in the meantime recommended to him earnestly to use me more tenderly and win me with his usual good carriage told him of his terrifying and affrighting me with his threats of sending me to a madhouse and the like and advised him not to make a woman desperate on any account whatever he promised her to soften his behaviour and bid her assure me that he loved me as well as ever and that he had no such design as that of sending me to a madhouse whatever he might say in his passion also he desired my mother to use the same persuasions to me too that our affections might be renewed and we might lie together in a good understanding as we used to do i found the effects of this treaty presently my husband s conduct was immediately altered and he was quite another man to me nothing could be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all occasions and i could do no less than make some return to it which i did as well as i could but it was but in an awkward manner at best for nothing was more frightful to me than his caresses and the apprehensions of being with child again by him was ready to throw me into fits and this made me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the case to him without any more delay which however i did with all the caution and reserve imaginable he had continued his altered carriage to me near a month and we began to live a new kind of life with one another and could i have satisfied myself to have gone on with it i believe it might have continued as long as we had continued alive together one evening as we were sitting and talking very friendly together under a little awning which served as an arbour at the entrance from our house into the garden he was in a very pleasant agreeable humour and said abundance of kind things to me relating to the pleasure of our present good agreement and the disorders of our past breach and what a satisfaction it was to him that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it i fetched a deep sigh and told him there was nobody in the world could be more delighted than i was in the good agreement we had always kept up or more afflicted with the breach of it and should be so still but i was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy circumstance in our case which lay too close to my heart and which i knew not how to break to him that rendered my part of it very miserable and took from me all the comfort of the rest he importuned me to tell him what it was i told him i could not tell how to do it that while it was concealed from him i alone was unhappy but if he knew it also we should be both so and that therefore to keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that i could do and it was on that account alone that i kept a secret from him the very keeping of which i thought would first or last be my destruction it is impossible to express his surprise at this relation and the double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him he told me i could not be called kind to him nay i could not be faithful to him if i concealed it from him i told him i thought so too and yet i could not do it he went back to what i had said before to him and told me he hoped it did not relate to what i had said in my passion and that he had resolved to forget all that as the effect of a rash provoked spirit i told him i wished i could forget it all too but that it was not to be done the impression was too deep and i could not do it it was impossible he then told me he was resolved not to differ with me in anything and that therefore he would importune me no more about it resolving to acquiesce in whatever i did or said only begged i should then agree that whatever it was it should no more interrupt our quiet and our mutual kindness this was the most provoking thing he could have said to me for i really wanted his further importunities that i might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal so i answered him plainly that i could not say i was glad not to be importuned thought i could not tell how to comply but come my dear said i what conditions will you make with me upon the opening this affair to you any conditions in the world said he that you can in reason desire of me well said i come give it me under your hand that if you do not find i am in any fault or that i am willingly concerned in the causes of the misfortune that is to follow you will not blame me use me the worse do me any injury or make me be the sufferer for that which is not my fault that says he is the most reasonable demand in the world not to blame you for that which is not your fault give me a pen and ink says he so i ran in and fetched a pen ink and paper and he wrote the condition down in the very words i had proposed it and signed it with his name well says he what is next my dear why says i the next is that you will not blame me for not discovering the secret of it to you before i knew it very just again says he with all my heart so he wrote down that also and signed it well my dear says i then i have but one condition more to make with you and that is that as there is nobody concerned in it but you and i you shall not discover it to any person in the world except your own mother and that in all the measures you shall take upon the discovery as i am equally concerned in it with you though as innocent as yourself you shall do nothing in a passion nothing to my prejudice or to your mother s prejudice without my knowledge and consent this a little amazed him and he wrote down the words distinctly but read them over and over before he signed them hesitating at them several times and repeating them my mother s prejudice and your prejudice what mysterious thing can this be however at last he signed it well says i my dear i ask you no more under your hand but as you are to hear the most unexpected and surprising thing that perhaps ever befell any family in the world i beg you to promise me you will receive it with composure and a presence of mind suitable to a man of sense i do my utmost says he upon condition you will keep me no longer in suspense for you terrify me with all these preliminaries well then says i it is this as i told you before in a heat that i was not your lawful wife and that our children were not legal children so i must let you know now in calmness and in kindness but with affliction enough that i am your own sister and you my own brother and that we are both the children of our mother now alive and in the house who is convinced of the truth of it in a manner not to be denied or contradicted i saw him turn pale and look wild and i said now remember your promise and receive it with presence of mind for who could have said more to prepare you for it than i have done however i called a servant and got him a little glass of rum which is the usual dram of that countr for he was just fainting away when he was a little recovered i said to him this story you may be sure requires a long explanation and therefore have patience and compose your mind to hear it out and i make it as short as i can and with this i told him what i thought was needful of the fact and particularly how my mother came to discover it to me as above and now my dear says i you will see reason for my capitulations and that i neither have been the cause of this matter nor could be so and that i could know nothing of it before now i am fully satisfied of that says he but tis a dreadful surprise to me however i know a remedy for it all and a remedy that shall put an end to your difficulties without your going to england that would be strange said i as all the rest no no says he i make it easy there s nobody in the way of it but myself he looked a little disordered when he said this but i did not apprehend anything from it at that time believing as it used to be said that they who do those things never talk of them or that they who talk of such things never do them but things were not come to their height with him and i observed he became pensive and melancholy and in a word as i thought a little distempered in his head i endeavoured to talk him into temper and to reason him into a kind of scheme for our government in the affair and sometimes he would be well and talk with some courage about it but the weight of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts and in short it went so far that he made attempts upon himself and in one of them had actually strangled himself and had not his mother come into the room in the very moment he had died but with the help of a negro servant she cut him down and recovered him things were now come to a lamentable height in the family my pity for him now began to revive that affection which at first i really had for him and i endeavoured sincerely by all the kind carriage i could to make up the breach but in short it had gotten too great a head it preyed upon his spirits and it threw him into a long lingering consumption though it happened not to be mortal in this distress i did not know what to do as his life was apparently declining and i might perhaps have married again there very much to my advantage it had been certainly my business to have stayed in the country but my mind was restless too and uneasy i hankered after coming to england and nothing would satisfy me without it in short by an unwearied importunity my husband who was apparently decaying as i observed was at last prevailed with and so my own fate pushing me on the way was made clear for me and my mother concurring i obtained a very good cargo for my coming to england when i parted with my brother for such i am now to call hi we agreed that after i arrived he should pretend to have an account that i was dead in england and so might marry again when he would he promised and engaged to me to correspond with me as a sister and to assist and support me as long as i lived and that if he died before me he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still in the name of a sister and he was in some respects careful of me when he heard of me but it was so oddly managed that i felt the disappointments very sensibly afterwards as you shall hear in its time i came away for england in the month of august after i had been eight years in that country and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me which perhaps few women have gone through the life of we had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of england and where we arrived in twondhirty days but were then ruffled with two or three storms one of which drove us away to the coast of ireland and we put in at kinsdale we remained there about thirteen days got some refreshment on shore and put to sea again though we met with very bad weather again in which the ship sprung her mainmast as they called it for i knew not what they meant but we got at last into milford haven in wales where though it was remote from our port yet having my foot safe upon the firm ground of my native country the isle of britain i resolved to venture it no more upon the waters which had been so terrible to me so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers i resolved to come for london and leave the ship to get to her port as she could the port whither she was bound was to bristol where my brother s chief correspondent lived i got to london in about three weeks where i heard a little while after that the ship was arrived in bristol but at the same time had the misfortune to know that by the violent weather she had been in and the breaking of her mainmast she had great damage on board and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled i had now a new scene of life upon my hands and a dreadful appearance it had i was come away with a kind of final farewell what i brought with me was indeed considerable had it come safe and by the help of it i might have married again tolerably well but as it was i was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole and this without any hope of recruit i was entirely without friends nay even so much as without acquaintance for i found it was absolutely necessary not to revive former acquaintances and as for my subtle friend that set me up formerly for a fortune she was dead and her husband also as i was informed upon sending a person unknown to inquire the looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to bristol and during my attendance upon that affair i took the diversion of going to the bath for as i was still far from being old so my humour which was always gay continued so to an extreme and being now as it were a woman of fortune though i was a woman without a fortune i expected something or other might happen in my way that might mend my circumstances as had been my case before the bath is a place of gallantry enough expensive and full of snares i went thither indeed in the view of taking anything that might offer but i must do myself justice as to protest i knew nothing amiss i meant nothing but in an honest way nor had i any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards i suffered them to be guided here i stayed the whole latter season as it is called there and contracted some unhappy acquaintances which rather prompted the follies i fell afterwards into than fortified me against them i lived pleasantly enough kept good company that is to say gay fine company but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly and that as i had no settled income so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death and this gave me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts however i shook them off and still flattered myself that something or other might offer for my advantage but i was in the wrong place for it i was not now at redriff where if i had set myself tolerably up some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony but i was at the bath where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way i had spent the first season well enough for though i had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the bath for his diversion yet i had entered into no felonious treaty as it might be called i had resisted some casual offers of gallantry and had managed that way well enough i was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it and i had no extraordinary offers made me that tempted me with the main thing which i wanted however i went this length the first season viz i contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house i lodged who though she did not keep an ill house as we call it yet had none of the best principles in herself i had on all occasions behaved myself so well as not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever and all the men that i had conversed with were of so good reputation that i had not given the least reflection by conversing with them nor did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked correspondence if they had any of them offered it yet there was one gentleman as above who always singled me out for the diversion of my company as he called it which as he was pleased to say was very agreeable to him but at that time there was no more in it i had many melancholy hours at the bath after the company was gone for though i went to bristol sometime for the disposing my effects and for recruits of money yet i chose to come back to bath for my residence because being on good terms with the woman in whose house i lodged in the summer i found that during the winter i lived rather cheaper there than i could do anywhere else here i say i passed the winter as heavily as i had passed the autumn cheerfully but having contracted a nearer intimacy with the said woman in whose house i lodged i could not avoid communicating to her something of what lay hardest upon my mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances and the loss of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea i told her also that i had a mother and a brother in virginia in good circumstances and as i had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my condition and the great loss i had received which indeed came to almost so i did not fail to let my new friend know that i expected a supply from thence and so indeed i did and as the ships went from bristol to york river in virginia and back again generally in less time from london and that my brother corresponded chiefly at bristol i thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to london where also i had not the least acquaintance my new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me and as for lodging during the winter i paid nothing at all when the spring season came on she continued to be as kind to me as she could and i lodged with her for a time till it was found necessary to do otherwise she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house and in particular the gentleman who as i said singled me out for his companion the winter before and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants and lodged in the same house i suspected that my landlady had invited him thither letting him know that i was still with her but she denied it and protested to me that she did not and he said the same in a word this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence as well as conversation he was a complete gentleman that must be confessed and his company was very agreeable to me as mine if i might believe him was to him he made no professions to me but of an extraordinary respect and he had such an opinion of my virtue that as he often professed he believed if he should offer anything else i should reject him with contempt he soon understood from me that i was a widow that i had arrived at bristol from virginia by the last ships and that i waited at bath till the next virginia fleet should arrive by which i expected considerable effects i understood by him and by others of him that he had a wife but that the lady was distempered in her head and was under the conduct of her own relations which he consented to to avoid any reflections that might as was not unusual in such case be cast on him for mismanaging her cure and in the meantime he came to the bath to divert his thoughts from the disturbance of such a melancholy circumstance as that was my landlady who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions gave me an advantageous character of him as a man of honour and of virtue as well as of great estate and indeed i had a great deal of reason to say so of him too for though we lodged both on a floor and he had frequently come into my chamber even when i was in bed and i also into his when he was in bed yet he never offered anything to me further than a kiss or so much as solicited me to anything till long after as you shall hear i frequently took notice to my landlady of his exceeding modesty and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning however she used to tell me that she thought i ought to expect some gratification from him for my company for indeed he did as it were engross me and i was seldom from him i told her i had not given him the least occasion to think i wanted it or that i would accept of it from him she told me she would take that part upon her and she did so and managed it so dexterously that the first time we were together alone after she had talked with him he began to inquire a little into my circumstances as how i had subsisted myself since i came on shore and whether i did not want money i stood off very boldly i told him that though my cargo of tobacco was damaged yet that it was not quite lost that the merchant i had been consigned to had so honestly managed for me that i had not wanted and that i hoped with frugal management i should make it hold out till more would come which i expected by the next fleet that in the meantime i had retrenched my expenses and whereas i kept a maid last season now i lived without and whereas i had a chamber and a diningoom then on the first floor as he knew i now had but one room two pair of stairs and the like but i live said i as well satisfied now as i did then adding that his company had been a means to make me live much more cheerfully than otherwise i should have done for which i was much obliged to him and so i put off all room for any offer for the present however it was not long before he attacked me again and told me he found that i was backward to trust him with the secret of my circumstances which he was sorry for assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity but merely to assist me if there was any occasion but since i would not own myself to stand in need of any assistance he had but one thing more to desire of me and that was that i would promise him that when i was any way straitened or like to be so i would frankly tell him of it and that i would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer adding that i should always find i had a true friend though perhaps i was afraid to trust him i omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged to let him know that i had a due sense of his kindness and indeed from that time i did not appear so much reserved to him as i had done before though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides but how free soever our conversation was i could not arrive to that sort of freedom which he desired viz to tell him i wanted money though i was secretly very glad of his offer some weeks passed after this and still i never asked him for money when my landlady a cunning creature who had often pressed me to it but found that i could not do it makes a story of her own inventing and comes in bluntly to me when we were together oh widow says she i have bad news to tell you this morning what is that said i are the virginia ships taken by the french for that was my fear no no says she but the man you sent to bristol yesterday for money is come back and says he has brought none now i could by no means like her project i thought it looked too much like prompting him which indeed he did not want and i clearly saw that i should lose nothing by being backward to ask so i took her up short i can t image why he should say so to you said i for i assure you he brought me all the money i sent him for and here it is said i pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in i and added i intend you shall have most of it by and by he seemed distasted a little at her talking as she did at first as well as i taking it as i fancied he would as something forward of her but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself again the next morning we talked of it again when i found he was fully satisfied and smiling said he hoped i would not want money and not tell him of it and that i had promised him otherwise i told him i had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady s talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with but i supposed she wanted what i owed her which was about eight guineas which i had resolved to give her and had accordingly given it her the same night she talked so foolishly he was in a might good humour when he heard me say i had paid her and it went off into some other discourse at that time but the next morning he having heard me up about my room before him he called to me and i answering he asked me to come into his chamber he was in bed when i came in and he made me come and sit down on his bedside for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment after some very kind expressions he asked me if i would be very honest to him and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me after some little cavil at the word sincere and asking him if i had ever given him any answers which were not sincere i promised him i would why then his request was he said to let him see my purse i immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing to him pulled it out and there was in it three guineas and a half then he asked me if there was all the money i had i told him no laughing again not by a great deal well then he said he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money i had every farthing i told him i would and i went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer where i had about six guineas more and some silver and threw it all down upon the bed and told him there was all my wealth honestly to a shilling he looked a little at it but did not tell it and huddled it all into the drawer again and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key and bade me open a little walnutree box he had upon the table and bring him such a drawer which i did in which drawer there was a great deal of money in gold i believe near two hundred guineas but i knew not how much he took the drawer and taking my hand made me put it in and take a whole handful i was backward at that but he held my hand hard in his hand and put it into the drawer and made me take out as many guineas almost as i could well take up at once when i had done so he made me put them into my lap and took my little drawer and poured out all my money among his and bade me get me gone and carry it all home into my own chamber i relate this story the more particularly because of the goodumour there was in it and to show the temper with which we conversed it was not long after this but he began every day to find fault with my clothes with my laces and headdresses and in a word pressed me to buy better which by the way i was willing enough to do though i did not seem to be so for i loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes i told him i must housewife the money he had lent me or else i should not be able to pay him again he then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me and knew my circumstances he had not lent me that money but given it me and that he thought i had merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as i had done after this he made me take a maid and keep house and his friend that come with him to bath being gone he obliged me to diet him which i did very willingly believing as it appeared that i should lose nothing by it nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too we had lived thus near three months when the company beginning to wear away at the bath he talked of going away and fain he would have me to go to london with him i was not very easy in that proposal not knowing what posture i was to live in there or how he might use me but while this was in debate he fell very sick he had gone out to a place in somersetshire called shepton where he had some business and was there taken very ill and so ill that he could not travel so he sent his man back to bath to beg me that i would hire a coach and come over to him before he went he had left all his money and other things of value with me and what to do with them i did not know but i secured them as well as i could and locked up the lodgings and went to him where i found him very ill indeed however i persuaded him to be carried in a litter to the bath where there was more help and better advice to be had he consented and i brought him to the bath which was about fifteen miles as i remember here he continued very ill of a fever and kept his bed five weeks all which time i nursed him and tended him myself as much and as carefully as if i had been his wife indeed if i had been his wife i could not have done more i sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer and then i got a palleted into his room and lay in it just at his bed s feet i was indeed sensibly affected with his condition and with the apprehension of losing such a friend as he was and was like to be to me and i used to sit and cry by him many hours together however at last he grew better and gave hopes that he would recover as indeed he did though very slowly were it otherwise than what i am going to say i should not be backward to disclose it as it is apparent i have done in other cases in this account but i affirm that through all this conversation abating the freedom of coming into the chamber when i or he was in bed and abating the necessary offices of attending him night and day when he was sick there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us oh that it had been so to the last after some time he gathered strength and grew well apace and i would have removed my palleted but he would not let me till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him and then i removed to my own chamber he took many occasions to express his sense of my tenderness and concern for him and when he grew quite well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care and as he called it for hazarding my life to save his and now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own i told him i was fully satisfied of it he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it if i was assaulted by a ravisher i believed him and told him i did so but this did not satisfy him he would he said wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it it was a great while after this that i had occasion on my own business to go to bristol upon which he hired me a coach and would go with me and did so and now indeed our intimacy increased from bristol he carried me to gloucester which was merely a journey of pleasure to take the air and here it was our hap to have no lodging in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it the master of the house going up with us to show his rooms and coming into that room said very frankly to him sir it is none of my business to inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no but if not you may lie as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers and with that he pulls a great curtain which drew quite across the room and effectually divided the beds well says my friend very readily these beds will do and as for the rest we are too near akin to lie together though we may lodge near one another and this put an honest face on the thing too when we came to go to bed he decently went out of the room till i was in bed and then went to bed in the bed on his own side of the room but lay there talking to me a great while at last repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me and not offer me the least injury he starts out of his bed and now my dear says he you shall see how just i will be to you and that i can keep my word and away he comes to my bed i resisted a little but i must confess i should not have resisted him much if he had not made those promises at all so after a little struggle as i said i lay still and let him come to bed when he was there he took me in his arms and so i lay all night with him but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me other than embracing me as i say in his arms no not the whole night but rose up and dressed him in the morning and left me as innocent for him as i was the day i was born this was a surprising thing to me and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work for he was a strong vigorous brisk person nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all but of mere affection insisting on it that though i was to him the most agreeable woman in the world yet because he loved me he could not injure me i own it was a noble principle but as it was what i never understood before so it was to me perfectly amazing we traveled the rest of the journey as we did before and came back to the bath where as he had opportunity to come to me when he would he often repeated the moderation and i frequently lay with him and he with me and although all the familiarities between man and wife were common to us yet he never once offered to go any farther and he valued himself much upon it i do not say that i was so wholly pleased with it as he thought i was for i own much wickeder than he as you shall hear presently we lived thus near two years only with this exception that he went three times to london in that time and once he continued there four months but to do him justice he always supplied me with money to subsist me very handsomely had we continued thus i confess we had had much to boast of but as wise men say it is ill venturing too near the brink of a command so we found it and here again i must do him the justice to own that the first breach was not on his part it was one night that we were in bed together warm and merry and having drunk i think a little more wine that night both of us than usual although not in the least to disorder either of us when after some other follies which i cannot name and being clasped close in his arms i told him i repeat it with shame and horror of sou that i could find in my heart to discharge him of his engagement for one night and no more he took me at my word immediately and after that there was no resisting him neither indeed had i any mind to resist him any more let what would come of it thus the government of our virtue was broken and i exchanged the place of friend for that unmusical harshounding title of whore in the morning we were both at our penitentials i cried very heartily he expressed himself very sorry but that was all either of us could do at that time and the way being thus cleared and the bars of virtue and conscience thus removed we had the less difficult afterwards to struggle with it was but a dull kind of conversation that we had together for all the rest of that week i looked on him with blushes and every now and then started that melancholy objection what if i should be with child now what will become of me then he encouraged me by telling me that as long as i was true to him he would be so to me and since it was gone such a length which indeed he never intende yet if i was with child he would take care of that and of me too this hardened us both i assured him if i was with child i would die for want of a midwife rather than name him as the father of it and he assured me i should never want if i should be with child these mutual assurances hardened us in the thing and after this we repeated the crime as often as we pleased till at length as i had feared so it came to pass and i was indeed with child after i was sure it was so and i had satisfied him of it too we began to think of taking measures for the managing it and i proposed trusting the secret to my landlady and asking her advice which he agreed to my landlady a woman as i foun used to such things made light of it she said she knew it would come to that at last and made us very merry about it as i said above we found her an experienced old lady at such work she undertook everything engaged to procure a midwife and a nurse to satisfy all inquiries and bring us off with reputation and she did so very dexterously indeed when i grew near my time she desired my gentleman to go away to london or make as if he did so when he was gone she acquainted the parish officers that there was a lady ready to lie in at her house but that she knew her husband very well and gave them as she pretended an account of his name which she called sir walter cleve telling them he was a very worthy gentleman and that she would answer for all inquiries and the like this satisfied the parish officers presently and i lay in with as much credit as i could have done if i had really been my lady cleve and was assisted in my travail by three or four of the best citizens wives of bath who lived in the neighbourhood which however made me a little the more expensive to him i often expressed my concern to him about it but he bid me not be concerned at it as he had furnished me very sufficiently with money for the extraordinary expenses of my lying in i had everything very handsome about me but did not affect to be gay or extravagant neither besides knowing my own circumstances and knowing the world as i had done and that such kind of things do not often last long i took care to lay up as much money as i could for a wet day as i called it making him believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary appearance of things in my lying in by this means and including what he had given me as above i had at the end of my lying in about two hundred guineas by me including also what was left of my own i was brought to bed of a fine boy indeed and a charming child it was and when he heard of it he wrote me a very kind obliging letter about it and then told me he thought it would look better for me to come away for london as soon as i was up and well that he had provided apartments for me at hammersmith as if i came thither only from london and that after a little while i should go back to the bath and he would go with me i liked this offer very well and accordingly hired a coach on purpose and taking my child and a weturse to tend and suckle it and a maidervant with me away i went for london he met me at reading in his own chariot and taking me into that left the servant and the child in the hired coach and so he brought me to my new lodgings at hammersmith with which i had abundance of reason to be very well pleased for they were very handsome rooms and i was very well accommodated and now i was indeed in the height of what i might call my prosperity and i wanted nothing but to be a wife which however could not be in this case there was no room for it and therefore on all occasions i studied to save what i could as i have said above against a time of scarcity knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue that men that keep mistresses often change them grow weary of them or jealous of them or something or other happens to make them withdraw their bounty and sometimes the ladies that are thus well used are not careful by a prudent conduct to preserve the esteem of their persons or the nice article of their fidelity and then they are justly cast off with contempt but i was secured in this point for as i had no inclination to change so i had no manner of acquaintance in the whole house and so no temptation to look any farther i kept no company but in the family when i lodged and with the clergyman s lady at next door so that when he was absent i visited nobody nor did he ever find me out of my chamber or parlour whenever he came down if i went anywhere to take the air it was always with him the living in this manner with him and his with me was certainly the most undesigned thing in the world he often protested to me that when he became first acquainted with me and even to the very night when we first broke in upon our rules he never had the least design of lying with me that he always had a sincere affection for me but not the least real inclination to do what he had done i assured him i never suspected him that if i had i should not so easily have yielded to the freedom which brought it on but that it was all a surprise and was owing to the accident of our having yielded too far to our mutual inclinations that night and indeed i have often observed since and leave it as a caution to the readers of this story that we ought to be cautious of gratifying our inclinations in loose and lewd freedoms lest we find our resolutions of virtue fail us in the junction when their assistance should be most necessary it is true and i have confessed it before that from the first hour i began to converse with him i resolved to let him lie with me if he offered it but it was because i wanted his help and assistance and i knew no other way of securing him than that but when we were that night together and as i have said had gone such a length i found my weakness the inclination was not to be resisted but i was obliged to yield up all even before he asked it however he was so just to me that he never upbraided me with that nor did he ever express the least dislike of my conduct on any other occasion but always protested he was as much delighted with my company as he was the first hour we came together i mean came together as bedfellows it is true that he had no wife that is to say she was as no wife to him and so i was in no danger that way but the just reflections of conscience oftentimes snatch a man especially a man of sense from the arms of a mistress as it did him at last though on another occasion on the other hand though i was not without secret reproaches of my own conscience for the life i led and that even in the greatest height of the satisfaction i ever took yet i had the terrible prospect of poverty and starving which lay on me as a frightful spectre so that there was no looking behind me but as poverty brought me into it so fear of poverty kept me in it and i frequently resolved to leave it quite off if i could but come to lay up money enough to maintain me but these were thoughts of no weight and whenever he came to me they vanished for his company was so delightful that there was no being melancholy when he was there the reflections were all the subject of those hours when i was alone i lived six years in this happy but unhappy condition in which time i brought him three children but only the first of them lived and though i removed twice in those six years yet i came back the sixth year to my first lodgings at hammersmith here it was that i was one morning surprised with a kind but melancholy letter from my gentleman intimating that he was very ill and was afraid he should have another fit of sickness but that his wife s relations being in the house with him it would not be practicable to have me with him which however he expressed his great dissatisfaction in and that he wished i could be allowed to tend and nurse him as i did before i was very much concerned at this account and was very impatient to know how it was with him i waited a fortnight or thereabouts and heard nothing which surprised me and i began to be very uneasy indeed i think i may say that for the next fortnight i was near to distracted it was my particular difficulty that i did not know directly where he was for i understood at first he was in the lodgings of his wife s mother but having removed myself to london i soon found by the help of the direction i had for writing my letters to him how to inquire after him and there i found that he was at a house in bloomsbury whither he had a little before he fell sick removed his whole family and that his wife and wife s mother were in the same house though the wife was not suffered to know that she was in the same house with her husband here i also soon understood that he was at the last extremity which made me almost at the last extremity too to have a true account one night i had the curiosity to disguise myself like a servantaid in a round cap and straw hat and went to the door as sent by a lady of his neighbourhood where he lived before and giving master and mistress s service i said i was sent to know how mr did and how he had rested that night in delivering this message i got the opportunity i desired for speaking with one of the maids i held a long gossip s tale with her and had all the particulars of his illness which i found was a pleurisy attended with a cough and a fever she told me also who was in the house and how his wife was who by her relation they were in some hopes might recover her understanding but as to the gentleman himself in short she told me the doctors said there was very little hopes of him that in the morning they thought he had been dying and that he was but little better then for they did not expect that he could live over the next night this was heavy news for me and i began now to see an end of my prosperity and to see also that it was very well i had played to good housewife and secured or saved something while he was alive for that now i had no view of my own living before me it lay very heavy upon my mind too that i had a son a fine lovely boy about five years old and no provision made for it at least that i knew of with these considerations and a sad heart i went home that evening and began to cast with myself how i should live and in what manner to bestow myself for the residue of my life you may be sure i could not rest without inquiring again very quickly what was become of him and not venturing to go myself i sent several sham messengers till after a fortnight s waiting longer i found that there was hopes of his life though he was still very ill then i abated my sending any more to the house and in some time after i learned in the neighbourhood that he was about house and then that he was abroad again i made no doubt then but that i should soon hear of him and began to comfort myself with my circumstances being as i thought recovered i waited a week and two weeks and with much surprise and amazement i waited near two months and heard nothing but that being recovered he was gone into the country for the air and for the better recovery after his distemper after this it was yet two months more and then i understood he was come to his city house again but still i heard nothing from him i had written several letters for him and directed them as usual and found two or three of them had been called for but not the rest i wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever and in one of them let him know that i must be forced to wait on him myself representing my circumstances the rent of lodgings to pay and the provision for the child wanting and my own deplorable condition destitute of subsistence for his most solemn engagement to take care of and provide for me i took a copy of this letter and finding it lay at the house near a month and was not called for i found means to have the copy of it put into his own hands at a coffeeouse where i had by inquiry found he used to go this letter forced an answer from him by which though i found i was to be abandoned yet i found he had sent a letter to me some time before desiring me to go down to the bath again its contents i shall come to presently it is true that sickeds are the time when such correspondences as this are looked on with different countenances and seen with other eyes than we saw them with or than they appeared with before my lover had been at the gates of death and at the very brink of eternity and it seems had been struck with a due remorse and with sad reflections upon his past life of gallantry and levity and among the rest criminal correspondence with me which was neither more nor less than a longontinued life of adultery and represented itself as it really was not as it had been formerly thought by him to be and he looked upon it now with a just and religious abhorrence i cannot but observe also and leave it for the direction of my sex in such cases of pleasure that whenever sincere repentance succeeds such a crime as this there never fails to attend a hatred of the object and the more the affection might seem to be before the hatred will be the more in proportion it will always be so indeed it can be no otherwise for there cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence of the offence and the love to the cause of it remain there will with an abhorrence of the sin be found a detestation of the fellowinner you can expect no other i found it so here though good manners and justice in this gentleman kept him from carrying it on to any extreme but the short history of his part in this affair was thus he perceived by my last letter and by all the rest which he went for after that i was not gone to bath that his first letter had not come to my hand upon which he write me this following madam i am surprised that my letter dated the th of last month did not come to your hand i give you my word it was delivered at your lodgings and to the hands of your maid i need not acquaint you with what has been my condition for some time past and how having been at the edge of the grave i am by the unexpected and undeserved mercy of heaven restored again in the condition i have been in it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy correspondence had not been the least of the burthens which lay upon my conscience i need say no more those things that must be repented of must be also reformed i wish you would think of going back to the bath i enclose you here a bill for for clearing yourself at your lodgings and carrying you down and hope it will be no surprise to you to add that on this account only and not for any offence given me on your side i can see you no more i will take due care of the child leave him where he is or take him with you as you please i wish you the like reflections and that they may be to your advantage i am etc i was struck with this letter as with a thousand wounds such as i cannot describe the reproaches of my own conscience were such as i cannot express for i was not blind to my own crime and i reflected that i might with less offence have continued with my brother and lived with him as a wife since there was no crime in our marriage on that score neither of us knowing it but i never once reflected that i was all this while a married woman a wife to mr the linenraper who though he had left me by the necessity of his circumstances had no power to discharge me from the marriage contract which was between us or to give me a legal liberty to marry again so that i had been no less than a whore and an adulteress all this while i then reproached myself with the liberties i had taken and how i had been a snare to this gentleman and that indeed i was principal in the crime that now he was mercifully snatched out of the gulf by a convincing work upon his mind but that i was left as if i was forsaken of god s grace and abandoned by heaven to a continuing in my wickedness under these reflections i continued very pensive and sad for near month and did not go down to the bath having no inclination to be with the woman whom i was with before lest as i thought she should prompt me to some wicked course of life again as she had done and besides i was very loth she should know i was cast off as above and now i was greatly perplexed about my little boy it was death to me to part with the child and yet when i considered the danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without a maintenance to support him i then resolved to leave him where he was but then i concluded also to be near him myself too that i then might have the satisfaction of seeing him without the care of providing for him i sent my gentleman a short letter therefore that i had obeyed his orders in all things but that of going back to the bath which i could not think of for many reasons that however parting from him was a wound to me that i could never recover yet that i was fully satisfied his reflections were just and would be very far from desiring to obstruct his reformation or repentance then i represented my own circumstances to him in the most moving terms that i was able i told him that those unhappy distresses which first moved him to a generous and an honest friendship for me would i hope move him to a little concern for me now though the criminal part of our correspondence which i believed neither of us intended to fall into at the time was broken off that i desired to repent as sincerely as he had done but entreated him to put me in some condition that i might not be exposed to the temptations which the devil never fails to excite us to from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress and if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him i begged he would put me in a posture to go back to my mother in virginia from when he knew i came and that would put an end to all his fears on that account i concluded that if he would send me more to facilitate my going away i would send him back a general release and would promise never to disturb him more with any importunities unless it was to hear of the welloing of the child whom if i found my mother living and my circumstances able i would send for to come over to me and take him also effectually off his hands this was indeed all a cheat thus far viz that i had no intention to go to virginia as the account of my former affairs there may convince anybody of but the business was to get this last of him if possible knowing well enough it would be the last penny i was ever to expect however the argument i used namely of giving him a general release and never troubling him any more prevailed effectually with him and he sent me a bill for the money by a person who brought with him a general release for me to sign and which i frankly signed and received the money and thus though full sore against my will a final end was put to this affair and here i cannot but reflect upon the unhappy consequence of too great freedoms between persons stated as we were upon the pretence of innocent intentions love of friendship and the like for the flesh has generally so great a share in those friendships that is great odds but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn resolutions and that vice breaks in at the breaches of decency which really innocent friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness but i leave the readers of these things to their own just reflections which they will be more able to make effectual than i who so soon forgot myself and am therefore but a very indifferent monitor i was now a single person again as i may call myself i was loosed from all the obligations either of wedlock or mistresship in the world except my husband the linenraper whom i having not now heard from in almost fifteen years nobody could blame me for thinking myself entirely freed from seeing also he had at his going away told me that if i did not hear frequently from him i should conclude he was dead and i might freely marry again to whom i pleased i now began to cast up my accounts i had by many letters and much importunity and with the intercession of my mother too had a second return of some goods from my brother as i now call hi in virginia to make up the damage of the cargo i brought away with me and this too was upon the condition of my sealing a general release to him and to send it him by his correspondent at bristol which though i thought hard of yet i was obliged to promise to do however i managed so well in this case that i got my goods away before the release was signed and then i always found something or other to say to evade the thing and to put off the signing it at all till at length i pretended i must write to my brother and have his answer before i could do it including this recruit and before i got the last i found my strength to amount put all together to about so that with that i had about i had saved above more but i met with a disaster with that which was this that a goldsmith in whose hands i had trusted it broke so i lost of my money the man s composition not making above out of his i had a little plate but not much and was well enough stocked with clothes and linen with this stock i had the world to begin again but you are to consider that i was not now the same woman as when i lived at redriff for first of all i was near twenty years older and did not look the better for my age nor for my rambles to virginia and back again and though i omitted nothing that might set me out to advantage except painting for that i never stooped to and had pride enough to think i did not want it yet there would always be some difference seen between fivendwenty and twondorty i cast about innumerable ways for my future state of life and began to consider very seriously what i should do but nothing offered i took care to make the world take me for something more than i was and had it given out that i was a fortune and that my estate was in my own hands the last of which was very true the first of it was as above i had no acquaintance which was one of my worst misfortunes and the consequence of that was i had no adviser at least who could assist and advise together and above all i had nobody to whom i could in confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to and could depend upon for their secrecy and fidelity and i found by experience that to be friendless is the worst condition next to being in want that a woman can be reduced to i say a woman because tis evident men can be their own advisers and their own directors and know how to work themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women but if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to and to advise and assist her tis ten to one but she is undone nay and the more money she has the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived and this was my case in the affair of the which i left in the hands of the goldsmith as above whose credit it seems was upon the ebb before but i that had no knowledge of things and nobody to consult with knew nothing of it and so lost my money in the next place when a woman is thus left desolate and void of counsel she is just like a bag of money or a jewel dropped on the highway which is a prey to the next comer if a man of virtue and upright principles happens to find it he will have it cried and the owner may come to hear of it again but how many times shall such a thing fall into hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their own to once that it shall come into good hands this was evidently my case for i was now a loose unguided creature and had no help no assistance no guide for my conduct i knew what i aimed at and what i wanted but knew nothing how to pursue the end by direct means i wanted to be placed in a settle state of living and had i happened to meet with a sober good husband i should have been as faithful and true a wife to him as virtue itself could have formed if i had been otherwise the vice came in always at the door of necessity not at the door of inclination and i understood too well by the want of it what the value of a settled life was to do anything to forfeit the felicity of it nay i should have made the better wife for all the difficulties i had passed through by a great deal nor did i in any of the time that i had been a wife give my husbands the least uneasiness on account of my behaviour but all this was nothing i found no encouraging prospect i waited i lived regularly and with as much frugality as became my circumstances but nothing offered nothing presented and the main stock wasted apace what to do i knew not the terror of approaching poverty lay hard upon my spirits i had some money but where to place it i knew not nor would the interest of it maintain me at least not in london at length a new scene opened there was in the house where i lodged a northountry woman that went for a gentlewoman and nothing was more frequent in her discourse than her account of the cheapness of provisions and the easy way of living in her country how plentiful and how cheap everything was what good company they kept and the like till at last i told her she almost tempted me to go and live in her country for i that was a widow though i had sufficient to live on yet had no way of increasing it and that i found i could not live here under a year unless i kept no company no servant made no appearance and buried myself in privacy as if i was obliged to it by necessity i should have observed that she was always made to believe as everybody else was that i was a great fortune or at least that i had three or four thousand pounds if not more and all in my own hands and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclined in the least to go into her country she said she had a sister lived near liverpool that her brother was a considerable gentleman there and had a great estate also in ireland that she would go down there in about two months and if i would give her my company thither i should be as welcome as herself for a month or more as i pleased till i should see how i liked the country and if i thought fit to live there she would undertake they would take care though they did not entertain lodgers themselves they would recommend me to some agreeable family where i should be placed to my content if this woman had known my real circumstances she would never have laid so many snares and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor desolate creature that was good for little when it was caught and indeed i whose case was almost desperate and thought i could not be much worse was not very anxious about what might befall me provided they did me no personal injury so i suffered myself though not without a great deal of invitation and great professions of sincere friendship and real kindness i say i suffered myself to be prevailed upon to go with her and accordingly i packed up my baggage and put myself in a posture for a journey though i did not absolutely know whither i was to go and now i found myself in great distress what little i had in the world was all in money except as before a little plate some linen and my clothes as for my household stuff i had little or none for i had lived always in lodgings but i had not one friend in the world with whom to trust that little i had or to direct me how to dispose of it and this perplexed me night and day i thought of the bank and of the other companies in london but i had no friend to commit the management of it to and keep and carry about with me bank bills tallies orders and such things i looked upon at as unsafe that if they were lost my money was lost and then i was undone and on the other hand i might be robbed and perhaps murdered in a strange place for them this perplexed me strangely and what to do i knew not it came in my thoughts one morning that i would go to the bank myself where i had often been to receive the interest of some bills i had which had interest payable on them and where i had found a clerk to whom i applied myself very honest and just to me and particularly so fair one time that when i had mistold my money and taken less than my due and was coming away he set me to rights and gave me the rest which he might have put into his own pocket i went to him and represented my case very plainly and asked if he would trouble himself to be my adviser who was a poor friendless widow and knew not what to do he told me if i desired his opinion of anything within the reach of his business he would do his endeavour that i should not be wronged but that he would also help me to a good sober person who was a grave man of his acquaintance who was a clerk in such business too though not in their house whose judgment was good and whose honesty i might depend upon for added he i will answer for him and for every step he takes if he wrongs you madam of one farthing it shall lie at my door i will make it good and he delights to assist people in such cases he does it as an act of charity i was a little at a stand in this discourse but after some pause i told him i had rather have depended upon him because i had found him honest but if that could not be i would take his recommendation sooner than any one s else i dare say madam says he that you will be as well satisfied with my friend as with me and he is thoroughly able to assist you which i am not it seems he had his hands full of the business of the bank and had engaged to meddle with no other business than that of his office which i heard afterwards but did not understand then he added that his friend should take nothing of me for his advice or assistance and this indeed encouraged me very much he appointed the same evening after the bank was shut and business over for me to meet him and his friend and indeed as soon as i saw his friend and he began but to talk of the affair i was fully satisfied that i had a very honest man to deal with his countenance spoke it and his character as i heard afterwards was everywhere so good that i had no room for any more doubts upon me after the first meeting in which i only said what i had said before we parted and he appointed me to come the next day to him telling me i might in the meantime satisfy myself of him by inquiry which however i knew not how well to do having no acquaintance myself accordingly i met him the next day when i entered more freely with him into my case i told him my circumstances at large that i was a widow come over from america perfectly desolate and friendless that i had a little money and but a little and was almost distracted for fear of losing it having no friend in the world to trust with the management of it that i was going into the north of england to live cheap that my stock might not waste that i would willingly lodge my money in the bank but that i durst not carry the bills about me and the like as above and how to correspond about it or with whom i knew not he told me i might lodge the money in the bank as an account and its being entered into the books would entitle me to the money at any time and if i was in the north i might draw bills on the cashier and receive it when i would but that then it would be esteemed as running cash and the bank would give no interest for it that i might buy stock with it and so it would lie in store for me but that then if i wanted to dispose if it i must come up to town on purpose to transfer it and even it would be with some difficulty i should receive the halfearly dividend unless i was here in person or had some friend i could trust with having the stock in his name to do it for me and that would have the same difficulty in it as before and with that he looked hard at me and smiled a little at last says he why do you not get a head steward madam that may take you and your money together into keeping and then you would have the trouble taken off your hands ay sir and the money too it may be said i for truly i find the hazard that way is as much as tis t other way but i remember i said secretly to myself i wish you would ask me the question fairly i would consider very seriously on it before i said no he went on a good way with me and i thought once or twice he was in earnest but to my real affliction i found at last he had a wife but when he owned he had a wife he shook his head and said with some concern that indeed he had a wife and no wife i began to think he had been in the condition of my late lover and that his wife had been distempered or lunatic or some such thing however we had not much more discourse at that time but he told me he was in too much hurry of business then but that if i would come home to his house after their business was over he would by that time consider what might be done for me to put my affairs in a posture of security i told him i would come and desired to know where he lived he gave me a direction in writing and when he gave it me he read it to me and said there tis madam if you dare trust yourself with me yes sir said i i believe i may venture to trust you with myself for you have a wife you say and i don t want a husband besides i dare trust you with my money which is all i have in the world and if that were gone i may trust myself anywhere he said some things in jest that were very handsome and mannerly and would have pleased me very well if they had been in earnest but that passed over i took the directions and appointed to attend him at his house at seven o clock the same evening when i came he made several proposals for my placing my money in the bank in order to my having interest for it but still some difficulty or other came in the way which he objected as not safe and i found such a sincere disinterested honesty in him that i began to muse with myself that i had certainly found the honest man i wanted and that i could never put myself into better hands so i told him with a great deal of frankness that i had never met with a man or woman yet that i could trust or in whom i could think myself safe but that i saw he was so disinterestedly concerned for my safety that i said i would freely trust him with the management of that little i had if he would accept to be steward for a poor widow that could give him no salary he smiled and standing up with great respect saluted me he told me he could not but take it very kindly that i had so good an opinion of him that he would not deceive me that he would do anything in his power to serve me and expect no salary but that he could not by any means accept of a trust that it might bring him to be suspected of selfnterest and that if i should die he might have disputes with my executors which he should be very loth to encumber himself with i told him if those were all his objections i would soon remove them and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty for that first as for suspecting him if ever i should do it now is the time to suspect him and not put the trust into his hands and whenever i did suspect him he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any further then as to executors i assured him i had no heirs nor any relations in england and i should alter my condition before i died and then his trust and trouble should cease together which however i had no prospect of yet but i told him if i died as i was it should be all his own and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me as i was satisfied he would be he changed his countenance at this discourse and asked me how i came to have so much goodill for him and looking very much pleased said he might very lawfully wish he was a single man for my sake i smiled and told him as he was not my offer could have no design upon him in it and to wish as he did was not to be allowed twas criminal to his wife he told me i was wrong for says he madam as i said before i have a wife and no wife and twould be no sin to me to wish her hanged if that were all i know nothing of your circumstances that way sir said i but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead i tell you says he again she is a wife and no wife you don t know what i am or what she is that s true said i sir i do not know what you are but i believe you to be an honest man and that s the cause of all my confidence in you well well says he and so i am i hope too but i am something else too madam for says he to be plain with you i am a cuckold and she is a whore he spoke it in a kind of jest but it was with such an awkward smile that i perceived it was what struck very close to him and he looked dismally when he said it that alters the case indeed sir said i as to that part you were speaking of but a cuckold you know may be an honest man it does not alter that case at all besides i think said i since your wife is so dishonest to you you are too honest to her to own her for your wife but that said i is what i have nothing to do with nay says he i do not think to clear my hands of her for to be plain with you madam added he i am no contended cuckold neither on the other hand i assure you it provokes me the highest degree but i can t help myself she that will be a whore will be a whore i waived the discourse and began to talk of my business but i found he could not have done with it so i let him alone and he went on to tell me all the circumstances of his case too long to relate here particularly that having been out of england some time before he came to the post he was in she had had two children in the meantime by an officer of the army and that when he came to england and upon her submission took her again and maintained her very well yet she ran away from him with a linenraper s apprentice robbed him of what she could come at and continued to live from him still so that madam says he she is a whore not by necessity which is the common bait of your sex but by inclination and for the sake of the vice well i pitied him and wished him well rid of her and still would have talked of my business but it would not do at last he looks steadily at me look you madam says he you came to ask advice of me and i will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own sister but i must turn the tables since you oblige me to do it and are so friendly to me and i think i must ask advice of you tell me what must a poor abused fellow do with a whore what can i do to do myself justice upon her alas sir says i tis a case too nice for me to advise in but it seems she has run away from you so you are rid of her fairly what can you desire more ay she is gone indeed said he but i am not clear of her for all that that s true says i she may indeed run you into debt but the law has furnished you with methods to prevent that also you may cry her down as they call it no no says he that is not the case neither i have taken care of all that tis not that part that i speak of but i would be rid of her so that i might marry again well sir says i then you must divorce her if you can prove what you say you may certainly get that done and then i suppose you are free that s very tedious and expensive says he why says i if you can get any woman you like to take your word i suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes herself ay says he but twould be hard to bring an honest woman to do that and for the other sort says he i have had enough of her to meddle with any more whores it occurred to me presently i would have taken your word with all my heart if you had but asked me the question but that was to myself to him i replied why you shut the door against any honest woman accepting you for you condemn all that should venture upon you at once and conclude that really a woman that takes you now can t be honest why says he i wish you would satisfy me that an honest woman would take me i venture it and then turns short upon me will you take me madam that s not a fair question says i after what you have said however lest you should think i wait only for a recantation of it i shall answer you plainly no not i my business is of another kind with you and i did not expect you would have turned my serious application to you in my own distracted case into a comedy why madam says he my case is as distracted as yours can be and i stand in as much need of advice as you do for i think if i have not relief somewhere i shall be made myself and i know not what course to take i protest to you why sir says i tis easy to give advice in your case much easier than it is in mine speak then says he i beg of you for now you encourage me why says i if your case is so plain as you say it is you may be legally divorced and then you may find honest women enough to ask the question of fairly the sex is not so scarce that you can want a wife well then said he i am in earnest i take your advice but shall i ask you one question seriously beforehand any question said i but that you did before no that answer will not do said he for in short that is the question i shall ask you may ask what questions you please but you have my answer to that already said i besides sir said i can you think so ill of me as that i would give any answer to such a question beforehand can any woman alive believe you in earnest or think you design anything but to banter her well well says he i do not banter you i am in earnest consider of it but sir says i a little gravely i came to you about my own business i beg of you to let me know what you will advise me to do i will be prepared says he against you come again nay says i you have forbid my coming any more why so said he and looked a little surprised because said i you can t expect i should visit you on the account you talk of well says he you shall promise me to come again however and i will not say any more of it till i have gotten the divorce but i desire you will prepare to be better conditioned when that s done for you shall be the woman or i will not be divorced at all why i owe it to your unlookedor kindness if it were to nothing else but i have other reasons too he could not have said anything in the world that pleased me better however i knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the thing was so remote as it appeared to be and that it was time enough to accept of it when he was able to perform it so i said very respectfully to him it was time enough to consider of these things when he was in a condition to talk of them in the meantime i told him i was going a great way from him and he would find objects enough to please him better we broke off here for the present and he made me promise him to come again the next day for his resolutions upon my own business which after some pressing i did though had he seen farther into me i wanted no pressing on that account i came the next evening accordingly and brought my maid with me to let him see that i kept a maid but i sent her away as soon as i was gone in he would have had me let the maid have stayed but i would not but ordered her aloud to come for me again about nine o clock but he forbade that and told me he would see me safe home which by the way i was not very well pleased with supposing he might do that to know where i lived and inquire into my character and circumstances however i ventured that for all that the people there or thereabout knew of me was to my advantage and all the character he had of me after he had inquired was that i was a woman of fortune and that i was a very modest sober body which whether true or not in the main yet you may see how necessary it is for all women who expect anything in the world to preserve the character of their virtue even when perhaps they may have sacrificed the thing itself i found and was not a little please with it that he had provided a supper for me i found also he lived very handsomely and had a house very handsomely furnished all of which i was rejoiced at indeed for i looked upon it as all my own we had now a second conference upon the subjectatter of the last conference he laid his business very home indeed he protested his affection to me and indeed i had no room to doubt it he declared that it began from the first moment i talked with him and long before i had mentioned leaving my effects with him tis no matter when it began thought i if it will but hold twill be well enough he then told me how much the offer i had made of trusting him with my effects and leaving them to him had engaged him so i intended it should thought i but then i thought you had been a single man too after we had supped i observed he pressed me very hard to drink two or three glasses of wine which however i declined but drank one glass or two he then told me he had a proposal to make to me which i should promise him i would not take ill if i should not grant it i told him i hoped he would make no dishonourable proposal to me especially in his own house and that if it was such i desired he would not propose it that i might not be obliged to offer any resentment to him that did not become the respect i professed for him and the trust i had placed in him in coming to his house and begged of him he would give me leave to go away and accordingly began to put on my gloves and prepare to be gone though at the same time i no more intended it than he intended to let me well he importuned me not to talk of going he assured me he had no dishonourable thing in his thoughts about me and was very far from offering anything to me that was dishonourable and if i thought so he would choose to say no more of it that part i did not relish at all i told him i was ready to hear anything that he had to say depending that he would say nothing unworthy of himself or unfit for me to hear upon this he told me his proposal was this that i would marry him though he had not yet obtained the divorce from the whore his wife and to satisfy me that he meant honourably he would promise not to desire me to live with him or go to bed with him till the divorce was obtained my heart said yes to this offer at first word but it was necessary to play the hypocrite a little more with him so i seemed to decline the motion with some warmth and besides a little condemning the thing as unfair told him that such a proposal could be of no signification but to entangle us both in great difficulties for if he should not at last obtain the divorce yet we could not dissolve the marriage neither could we proceed in it so that if he was disappointed in the divorce i left him to consider what a condition we should both be in in short i carried on the argument against this so far that i convinced him it was not a proposal that had any sense in it well then he went from it to another and that was that i would sign and seal a contract with him conditioning to marry him as soon as the divorce was obtained and to be void if he could not obtain it i told him such a thing was more rational than the other but as this was the first time that ever i could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest in this affair i did not use to say yes at first asking i would consider of it i played with this lover as an angler does with a trout i found i had him fast on the hook so i jested with his new proposal and put him off i told him he knew little of me and bade him inquire about me i let him also go home with me to my lodging though i would not ask him to go in for i told him it was not decent in short i ventured to avoid signing a contract of marriage and the reason why i did it was because the lady that had invited me so earnestly to go with her into lancashire insisted so positively upon it and promised me such great fortunes and such fine things there that i was tempted to go and try perhaps said i i may mend myself very much and then i made no scruple in my thoughts of quitting my honest citizen whom i was not so much in love with as not to leave him for a richer in a word i avoided a contract but told him i would go into the north that he should know where to write to me by the consequence of the business i had entrusted with him that i would give him a sufficient pledge of my respect for him for i would leave almost all i had in the world in his hands and i would thus far give him my word that as soon as he had sued out a divorce from his first wife he would send me an account of it i would come up to london and that then we would talk seriously of the matter it was a base design i went with that i must confess though i was invited thither with a design much worse than mine was as the sequel will discover well i went with my friend as i called her into lancashire all the way we went she caressed me with the utmost appearance of a sincere undissembled affection treated me except my coachire all the way and her brother brought a gentleman s coach to warrington to receive us and we were carried from thence to liverpool with as much ceremony as i could desire we were also entertained at a merchant s house in liverpool three or four days very handsomely i forbear to tell his name because of what followed then she told me she would carry me to an uncle s house of hers where we should be nobly entertained she did so her uncle as she called him sent a coach and four horses for us and we were carried near forty miles i know not whither we came however to a gentleman s seat where was a numerous family a large park extraordinary company indeed and where she was called cousin i told her if she had resolved to bring me into such company as this she should have let me have prepared myself and have furnished myself with better clothes the ladies took notice of that and told me very genteelly they did not value people in their country so much by their clothes as they did in london that their cousin had fully informed them of my quality and that i did not want clothes to set me off in short they entertained me not like what i was but like what they thought i had been namely a widow lady of a great fortune the first discovery i made here was that the family were all roman catholics and the cousin too whom i called my friend however i must say that nobody in the world could behave better to me and i had all the civility shown me that i could have had if i had been of their opinion the truth is i had not so much principle of any kind as to be nice in point of religion and i presently learned to speak favourably of the romish church particularly i told them i saw little but the prejudice of education in all the difference that were among christians about religion and if it had so happened that my father had been a roman catholic i doubted not but i should have been as well pleased with their religion as my own this obliged them in the highest degree and as i was besieged day and night with good company and pleasant discourse so i had two or three old ladies that lay at me upon the subject of religion too i was so complaisant that though i would not completely engage yet i made no scruple to be present at their mass and to conform to all their gestures as they showed me the pattern but i would not come too cheap so that i only in the main encouraged them to expect that i would turn roman catholic if i was instructed in the catholic doctrine as they called it and so the matter rested i stayed here about six weeks and then my conductor led me back to a country village about six miles from liverpool where her brother as she called hi came to visit me in his own chariot and in a very good figure with two footmen in a good livery and the next thing was to make love to me as it had happened to me one would think i could not have been cheated and indeed i thought so myself having a safe card at home which i resolved not to quit unless i could mend myself very much however in all appearance this brother was a match worth my listening to and the least his estate was valued at was a year but the sister said it was worth a year and lay most of it in ireland i that was a great fortune and passed for such was above being asked how much my estate was and my false friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay had raised it from to and by the time she came into the country she called it the irishman for such i understood him to be was stark mad at this bait in short he courted me made me presents and ran in debt like a madman for the expenses of his equipage and of his courtship he had to give him his due the appearance of an extraordinary fine gentleman he was tall wellhaped and had an extraordinary address talked as naturally of his park and his stables of his horses his gamekeepers his woods his tenants and his servants as if we had been in the mansionouse and i had seen them all about me he never so much as asked me about my fortune or estate but assured me that when we came to dublin he would jointure me in a year good land and that we could enter into a deed of settlement or contract here for the performance of it this was such language indeed as i had not been used to and i was here beaten out of all my measures i had a sheevil in my bosom every hour telling me how great her brother lived one time she would come for my orders how i would have my coaches painted and how lined and another time what clothes my page should wear in short my eyes were dazzled i had now lost my power of saying no and to cut the story short i consented to be married but to be the more private we were carried farther into the country and married by a romish clergyman who i was assured would marry us as effectually as a church of england parson i cannot say but i had some reflections in this affair upon the dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen who loved me sincerely and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom he had been indeed barbarously used and promised himself infinite happiness in his new choice which choice was now giving up herself to another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be but the glittering shoe of a great estate and of fine things which the deceived creature that was now my deceiver represented every hour to my imagination hurried me away and gave me no time to think of london or of anything there much less of the obligation i had to a person of infinitely more real merit than what was now before me but the thing was done i was now in the arms of my new spouse who appeared still the same as before great even to magnificence and nothing less than a year could support the ordinary equipage he appeared in after we had been married about a month he began to talk of my going to west chester in order to embark for ireland however he did not hurry me for we stayed near three weeks longer and then he sent to chester for a coach to meet us at the black rock as they call it over against liverpool thither we went in a fine boat they call a pinnace with six oars his servants and horses and baggage going in the ferryoat he made his excuse to me that he had no acquaintance in chester but he would go before and get some handsome apartment for me at a private house i asked him how long we should stay at chester he said not at all any longer than one night or two but he would immediately hire a coach to go to holyhead then i told him he should by no means give himself the trouble to get private lodgings for one night or two for that chester being a great place i made no doubt but there would be very good inns and accommodation enough so we lodged at an inn in the west street not far from the cathedral i forget what sign it was at here my spouse talking of my going to ireland asked me if i had no affairs to settle at london before we went off i told him no not of any great consequence but what might be done as well by letter from dublin madam says he very respectfully i suppose the greatest part of your estate which my sister tells me is most of it in money in the bank of england lies secure enough but in case it required transferring or any way altering its property it might be necessary to go up to london and settle those things before we went over i seemed to look strange at it and told him i knew not what he meant that i had no effects in the bank of england that i knew of and i hoped he could not say that i had ever told him i had no he said i had not told him so but his sister had said the greatest part of my estate lay there and i only mentioned it me dear said he that if there was any occasion to settle it or order anything about it we might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back again for he added that he did not care to venture me too much upon the sea i was surprised at this talk and began to consider very seriously what the meaning of it must be and it presently occurred to me that my friend who called him brother had represented me in colours which were not my due and i thought since it was come to that pitch that i would know the bottom of it before i went out of england and before i should put myself into i knew not whose hands in a strange country upon this i called his sister into my chamber the next morning and letting her know the discourse her brother and i had been upon the evening before i conjured her to tell me what she had said to him and upon what foot it was that she had made this marriage she owned that she had told him that i was a great fortune and said that she was told so at london told so says i warmly did i ever tell you so no she said it was true i did not tell her so but i had said several times that what i had was in my own disposal i did so returned i very quickly and hastily but i never told you i had anything called a fortune no not that i had or the value of in the world any how did it consist with my being a fortune said i that i should come here into the north of england with you only upon the account of living cheap at these words which i spoke warm and high my husband her brother as she called hi came into the room and i desired him to come and sit down for i had something of moment to say before them both which it was absolutely necessary he should hear he looked a little disturbed at the assurance with which i seemed to speak it and came and sat down by me having first shut the door upon which i began for i was very much provoked and turning myself to him i am afraid says i my dear for i spoke with kindness on his sid that you have a very great abuse put upon you and an injury done you never to be repaired in your marrying me which however as i have had no hand in it i desire i may be fairly acquitted of it and that the blame may lie where it ought to lie and nowhere else for i wash my hands of every part of it what injury can be done me my dear says he in marrying you i hope it is to my honour and advantage every way i will soon explain it to you says i and i fear you will have no reason to think yourself well used but i will convince you my dear says i again that i have had no hand in it and there i stopped a while he looked now scared and wild and began i believe to suspect what followed however looking towards me and saying only go on he sat silent as if to hear what i had more to say so i went on i asked you last night said i speaking to him if ever i made any boast to you of my estate or ever told you i had any estate in the bank of england or anywhere else and you owned i had not as is most true and i desire you will tell me here before your sister if ever i gave you any reason from me to think so or that ever we had any discourse about it and he owned again i had not but said i had appeared always as a woman of fortune and he depended on it that i was so and hoped he was not deceived i am not inquiring yet whether you have been deceived or not said i i fear you have and i too but i am clearing myself from the unjust charge of being concerned in deceiving you i have been now asking your sister if ever i told her of any fortune or estate i had or gave her any particulars of it and she owns i never did any pray madam said i turning myself to her be so just to me before your brother to charge me if you can if ever i pretended to you that i had an estate and why if i had should i come down into this country with you on purpose to spare that little i had and live cheap she could not deny one word but said she had been told in london that i had a very great fortune and that it lay in the bank of england and now dear sir said i turning myself to my new spouse again be so just to me as to tell me who has abused both you and me so much as to make you believe i was a fortune and prompt you to court me to this marriage he could not speak a word but pointed to her and after some more pause flew out in the most furious passion that ever i saw a man in my life cursing her and calling her all the whores and hard names he could think of and that she had ruined him declaring that she had told him i had and that she was to have of him for procuring this match for him he then added directing his speech to me that she was none of his sister but had been his whore for two years before that she had had of him in part of this bargain and that he was utterly undone if things were as i said and in his raving he swore he would let her heart s blood out immediately which frightened her and me too she cried said she had been told so in the house where i lodged but this aggravated him more than before that she should put so far upon him and run things such a length upon no other authority than a hearsay and then turning to me again said very honestly he was afraid we were both undone for to be plain my dear i have no estate says he what little i had this devil has made me run out in waiting on you and putting me into this equipage she took the opportunity of his being earnest in talking with me and got out of the room and i never saw her more i was confounded now as much as he and knew not what to say i thought many ways that i had the worst of it but his saying he was undone and that he had no estate neither put me into a mere distraction why says i to him this has been a hellish juggle for we are married here upon the foot of a double fraud you are undone by the disappointment it seems and if i had had a fortune i had been cheated too for you say you have nothing you would indeed have been cheated my dear says he but you would not have been undone for would have maintained us both very handsomely in this country and i assure you added he i had resolved to have dedicated every groat of it to you i would not have wronged you of a shilling and the rest i would have made up in my affection to you and tenderness of you as long as i lived this was very honest indeed and i really believe he spoke as he intended and that he was a man that was as well qualified to make me happy as to his temper and behaviour as any man ever was but his having no estate and being run into debt on this ridiculous account in the country made all the prospect dismal and dreadful and i knew not what to say or what to think of myself i told him it was very unhappy that so much love and so much good nature as i discovered in him should be thus precipitated into misery that i saw nothing before us but ruin for as to me it was my unhappiness that what little i had was not able to relieve us week and with that i pulled out a bank bill of and eleven guineas which i told him i had saved out of my little income and that by the account that creature had given me of the way of living in that country i expected it would maintain me three or four years that if it was taken from me i was left destitute and he knew what the condition of a woman among strangers must be if she had no money in her pocket however i told him if he would take it there it was he told me with a great concern and i thought i saw tears stand in his eyes that he would not touch it that he abhorred the thoughts of stripping me and make me miserable that on the contrary he had fifty guineas left which was all he had in the world and he pulled it out and threw it down on the table bidding me take it though he were to starve for want of it i returned with the same concern for him that i could not bear to hear him talk so that on the contrary if he could propose any probable method of living i would do anything that became me on my part and that i would live as close and as narrow as he could desire he begged of me to talk no more at that rate for it would make him distracted he said he was bred a gentleman though he was reduced to a low fortune and that there was but one way left which he could think of and that would not do unless i could answer him one question which however he said he would not press me to i told him i would answer it honestly whether it would be to his satisfaction or not that i could not tell why then my dear tell me plainly says he will the little you have keep us together in any figure or in any station or place or will it not it was my happiness hitherto that i had not discovered myself or my circumstances at all no not so much as my name and seeing these was nothing to be expected from him however goodumoured and however honest he seemed to be but to live on what i knew would soon be wasted i resolved to conceal everything but the bank bill and the eleven guineas which i had owned and i would have been very glad to have lost that and have been set down where he took me up i had indeed another bank bill about me of which was the whole of what i brought with me as well to subsist on in the country as not knowing what might offer because this creature the goetween that had thus betrayed us both had made me believe strange things of my marrying to my advantage in the country and i was not willing to be without money whatever might happen this bill i concealed and that made me the freer of the rest in consideration of his circumstances for i really pitied him heartily but to return to his question i told him i never willingly deceived him and i never would i was very sorry to tell him that the little i had would not subsist us that it was not sufficient to subsist me alone in the south country and that this was the reason that made me put myself into the hands of that woman who called him brother she having assured me that i might board very handsomely at a town called manchester where i had not yet been for about a year and my whole income not being about a year i thought i might live easy upon it and wait for better things he shook his head and remained silent and a very melancholy evening we had however we supped together and lay together that night and when we had almost supped he looked a little better and more cheerful and called for a bottle of wine come my dear says he though the case is bad it is to no purpose to be dejected come be as easy as you can i will endeavour to find out some way or other to live if you can but subsist yourself that is better than nothing i must try the world again a man ought to think like a man to be discouraged is to yield to the misfortune with this he filled a glass and drank to me holding my hand and pressing it hard in his hand all the while the wine went down and protesting afterwards his main concern was for me it was really a true gallant spirit he was of and it was the more grievous to me tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of honour rather than by a scoundrel but here the greatest disappointment was on his side for he had really spent a great deal of money deluded by this madam the procuress and it was very remarkable on what poor terms he proceeded first the baseness of the creature herself is to be observed who for the getting herself could be content to let him spend three or four more though perhaps it was all he had in the world and more than all when she had not the least ground more than a little teaable chat to say that i had any estate or was a fortune or the like it is true the design of deluding a woman of fortune if i had been so was base enough the putting the face of great things upon poor circumstances was a fraud and bad enough but the case a little differed too and that in his favour for he was not a rake that made a trade to delude women and as some have done get six or seven fortunes after one another and then rifle and run away from them but he was really a gentleman unfortunate and low but had lived well and though if i had had a fortune i should have been enraged at the slut for betraying me yet really for the man a fortune would not have been ill bestowed on him for he was a lovely person indeed of generous principles good sense and of abundance of goodumour we had a great deal of close conversation that night for we neither of us slept much he was as penitent for having put all those cheats upon me as if it had been felony and that he was going to execution he offered me again every shilling of the money he had about him and said he would go into the army and seek the world for more i asked him why he would be so unkind to carry me into ireland when i might suppose he could not have subsisted me there he took me in his arms my dear said he depend upon it i never designed to go to ireland at all much less to have carried you thither but came hither to be out of the observation of the people who had heard what i pretended to and withal that nobody might ask me for money before i was furnished to supply them but where then said i were we to have gone next why my dear said he i confess the whole scheme to you as i had laid it i purposed here to ask you something about your estate as you see i did and when you as i expected you would had entered into some account with me of the particulars i would have made an excuse to you to have put off our voyage to ireland for some time and to have gone first towards london then my dear said he i resolved to have confessed all the circumstances of my own affairs to you and let you know i had indeed made use of these artifices to obtain your consent to marry me but had now nothing to do but ask to your pardon and to tell you how abundantly as i have said above i would endeavour to make you forget what was past by the felicity of the days to come truly said i to him i find you would soon have conquered me and it is my affliction now that i am not in a condition to let you see how easily i should have been reconciled to you and have passed by all the tricks you had put upon me in recompense of so much goodumour but my dear said i what can we do now we are both undone and what better are we for our being reconciled together seeing we have nothing to live on we proposed a great many things but nothing could offer where there was nothing to begin with he begged me at last to talk no more of it for he said i would break his heart so we talked of other things a little till at last he took a husband s leave of me and so we went to sleep he rose before me in the morning and indeed having lain awake almost all night i was very sleepy and lay till near eleven o clock in this time he took his horses and three servants and all his linen and baggage and away he went leaving a short but moving letter for me on the table as follows my dear i am a dog i have abused you but i have been drawn into do it by a base creature contrary to my principle and the general practice of my life forgive me my dear i ask your pardon with the greatest sincerity i am the most miserable of men in having deluded you i have been so happy to possess you and now am so wretched as to be forced to fly from you forgive me my dear once more i say forgive me i am not able to see you ruined by me and myself unable to support you our marriage is nothing i shall never be able to see you again i here discharge you from it if you can marry to your advantage do not decline it on my account i here swear to you on my faith and on the word of a man of honour i will never disturb your repose if i should know of it which however is not likely on the other hand if you should not marry and if good fortune should befall me it shall be all yours wherever you are i have put some of the stock of money i have left into your pocket take places for yourself and your maid in the stageoach and go for london i hope it will bear your charges thither without breaking into your own again i sincerely ask your pardon and will do so as often as i shall ever think of you adieu my dear for ever i am your most affectionately j e nothing that ever befell me in my life sank so deep into my heart as this farewell i reproached him a thousand times in my thoughts for leaving me for i would have gone with him through the world if i had begged my bread i felt in my pocket and there found ten guineas his gold watch and two little rings one a small diamond ring worth only about and the other a plain gold ring i sat me down and looked upon these things two hours together and scarce spoke a word till my maid interrupted me by telling me my dinner was ready i ate but little and after dinner i fell into a vehement fit of crying every now and then calling him by his name which was james o jemmy said i come back come back i give you all i have i beg i starve with you and thus i ran raving about the room several times and then sat down between whiles and then walking about again called upon him to come back and then cried again and thus i passed the afternoon till about seven o clock when it was near dusk in the evening being august when to my unspeakable surprise he comes back into the inn but without a servant and comes directly up into my chamber i was in the greatest confusion imaginable and so was he too i could not imagine what should be the occasion of it and began to be at odds with myself whether to be glad or sorry but my affection biassed all the rest and it was impossible to conceal my joy which was too great for smiles for it burst out into tears he was no sooner entered the room but he ran to me and took me in his arms holding me fast and almost stopping my breath with his kisses but spoke not a word at length i began my dear said i how could you go away from me to which he gave no answer for it was impossible for him to speak when our ecstasies were a little over he told me he was gone about fifteen miles but it was not in his power to go any farther without coming back to see me again and to take his leave of me once more i told him how i had passed my time and how loud i had called him to come back again he told me he heard me very plain upon delamere forest at a place about twelve miles off i smiled nay says he do not think i am in jest for if ever i heard your voice in my life i heard you call me aloud and sometimes i thought i saw you running after me why said i what did i say for i had not named the words to him you called aloud says he and said o jemmy o jemmy come back come back i laughed at him my dear says he do not laugh for depend upon it i heard your voice as plain as you hear mine now if you please i go before a magistrate and make oath of it i then began to be amazed and surprised and indeed frightened and told him what i had really done and how i had called after him as above when we had amused ourselves a while about this i said to him well you shall go away from me no more i go all over the world with you rather he told me it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me but since it must be he hoped i would make it as easy to me as i could but as for him it would be his destruction that he foresaw however he told me that he considered he had left me to travel to london alone which was too long a journey and that as he might as well go that way as any way else he was resolved to see me safe thither or near it and if he did go away then without taking his leave i should not take it ill of him and this he made me promise he told me how he had dismissed his three servants sold their horses and sent the fellows away to seek their fortunes and all in a little time at a town on the road i know not where and says he it cost me some tears all alone by myself to think how much happier they were than their master for they could go to the next gentleman s house to see for a service whereas said he i knew not wither to go or what to do with myself i told him i was so completely miserable in parting with him that i could not be worse and that now he was come again i would not go from him if he would take me with him let him go whither he would or do what he would and in the meantime i agreed that we would go together to london but i could not be brought to consent he should go away at last and not take his leave of me as he proposed to do but told him jesting that if he did i would call him back again as loud as i did before then i pulled out his watch and gave it him back and his two rings and his ten guineas but he would not take them which made me very much suspect that he resolved to go off upon the road and leave me the truth is the circumstances he was in the passionate expressions of his letter the kind gentlemanly treatment i had from him in all the affair with the concern he showed for me in it his manner of parting with that large share which he gave me of his little stock left all these had joined to make such impressions on me that i really loved him most tenderly and could not bear the thoughts of parting with him two days after this we quitted chester i in the stageoach and he on horseback i dismissed my maid at chester he was very much against my being without a maid but she being a servant hired in the country and i resolving to keep no servant at london i told him it would have been barbarous to have taken the poor wench and have turned her away as soon as i came to town and it would also have been a needless charge on the road so i satisfied him and he was easy enough on the score he came with me as far as dunstable within thirty miles of london and then he told me fate and his own misfortunes obliged him to leave me and that it was not convenient for him to go to london for reasons which it was of no value to me to know and i saw him preparing to go the stageoach we were in did not usually stop at dunstable but i desiring it but for a quarter of an hour they were content to stand at an innoor a while and we went into the house being in the inn i told him i had but one favour more to ask of him and that was that since he could not go any farther he would give me leave to stay a week or two in the town with him that we might in that time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both as a final separation would be and that i had something of moment to offer him that i had never said yet and which perhaps he might find practicable to our mutual advantage this was too reasonable a proposal to be denied so he called the landlady of the house and told her his wife was taken ill and so ill that she could not think of going any farther in the stageoach which had tired her almost to death and asked if she could not get us a lodging for two or three days in a private house where i might rest me a little for the journey had been too much for me the landlady a good sort of woman wellred and very obliging came immediately to see me told me she had two or three very good rooms in a part of the house quite out of the noise and if i saw them she did not doubt but i would like them and i should have one of her maids that should do nothing else but be appointed to wait on me this was so very kind that i could not but accept of it and thank her so i went to look on the rooms and liked them very well and indeed they were extraordinarily furnished and very pleasant lodgings so we paid the stageoach took out our baggage and resolved to stay here a while here i told him i would live with him now till all my money was spent but would not let him spend a shilling of his own we had some kind squabble about that but i told him it was the last time i was like to enjoy his company and i desired he would let me be master in that thing only and he should govern in everything else so he acquiesced here one evening taking a walk into the fields i told him i would now make the proposal to him i had told him of accordingly i related to him how i had lived in virginia that i had a mother i believed was alive there still though my husband was dead some years i told him that had not my effects miscarried which by the way i magnified pretty much i might have been fortune good enough to him to have kept us from being parted in this manner then i entered into the manner of peoples going over to those countries to settle how they had a quantity of land given them by the constitution of the place and if not that it might be purchased at so easy a rate this it was not worth naming i then gave him a full and distinct account of the nature of planting how with carrying over but two or three hundred pounds value in english goods with some servants and tools a man of application would presently lay a foundation for a family and in a very few years be certain to raise an estate i let him into the nature of the product of the earth how the ground was cured and prepared and what the usual increase of it was and demonstrated to him that in a very few years with such a beginning we should be as certain of being rich as we were now certain of being poor he was surprised at my discourse for we made it the whole subject of our conversation for near a week together in which time i laid it down in black and white as we say that it was morally impossible with a supposition of any reasonable good conduct but that we must thrive there and do very well then i told him what measures i would take to raise such a sum of or thereabouts and i argued with him how good a method it would be to put an end to our misfortunes and restore our circumstances in the world to what we had both expected and i added that after seven years if we lived we might be in a posture to leave our plantations in good hands and come over again and receive the income of it and live here and enjoy it and i gave him examples of some that had done so and lived now in very good circumstances in london in short i pressed him so to it that he almost agreed to it but still something or other broke it off again till at last he turned the tables and he began to talk almost to the same purpose of ireland he told me that a man that could confine himself to country life and that could find but stock to enter upon any land should have farms there for a year as good as were here let for a year that the produce was such and so rich the land that if much was not laid up we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a gentleman of a year could do in england and that he had laid a scheme to leave me in london and go over and try and if he found he could lay a handsome foundation of living suitable to the respect he had for me as he doubted not he should do he would come over and fetch me i was dreadfully afraid that upon such a proposal he would have taken me at my word viz to sell my little income as i called it and turn it into money and let him carry it over into ireland and try his experiment with it but he was too just to desire it or to have accepted it if i had offered it and he anticipated me in that for he added that he would go and try his fortune that way and if he found he could do anything at it to live then by adding mine to it when i went over we should live like ourselves but that he would not hazard a shilling of mine till he had made the experiment with a little and he assured me that if he found nothing to be done in ireland he would then come to me and join in my project for virginia he was so earnest upon his project being to be tried first that i could not withstand him however he promised to let me hear from him in a very little time after his arriving there to let me know whether his prospect answered his design that if there was not a possibility of success i might take the occasion to prepare for our other voyage and then he assured me he would go with me to america with all his heart i could bring him to nothing further than this however those consultations entertained us near a month during which i enjoyed his company which indeed was the most entertaining that ever i met in my life before in this time he let me into the whole story of his own life which was indeed surprising and full of an infinite variety sufficient to fill up a much brighter history for its adventures and incidents than any i ever saw in print but i shall have occasion to say more of him hereafter we parted at last though with the utmost reluctance on my side and indeed he took his leave very unwillingly too but necessity obliged him for his reasons were very good why he would not come to london as i understood more fully some time afterwards i gave him a direction how to write to me though still i reserved the grand secret and never broke my resolution which was not to let him ever know my true name who i was or where to be found he likewise let me know how to write a letter to him so that he said he would be sure to receive it i came to london the next day after we parted but did not go directly to my old lodgings but for another nameless reason took a private lodging in st john s street or as it is vulgarly called st jones s near clerkenwell and here being perfectly alone i had leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven months ramble i had made for i had been abroad no less the pleasant hours i had with my last husband i looked back on with an infinite deal of pleasure but that pleasure was very much lessened when i found some time after that i was really with child this was a perplexing thing because of the difficulty which was before me where i should get leave to lie in it being one of the nicest things in the world at that time of day for a woman that was a stranger and had no friends to be entertained in that circumstance without security which by the way i had not neither could i procure any i had taken care all this while to preserve a correspondence with my honest friend at the bank or rather he took care to correspond with me for he wrote to me once a week and though i had not spent my money so fast as to want any from him yet i often wrote also to let him know i was alive i had left directions in lancashire so that i had these letters which he sent conveyed to me and during my recess at st jones s received a very obliging letter from him assuring me that his process for a divorce from his wife went on with success though he met with some difficulties in it that he did not expect i was not displeased with the news that his process was more tedious than he expected for though i was in no condition to have him yet not being so foolish to marry him when i knew myself to be with child by another man as some i know have ventured to do yet i was not willing to lose him and in a word resolved to have him if he continued in the same mind as soon as i was up again for i saw apparently i should hear no more from my husband and as he had all along pressed to marry and had assured me he would not be at all disgusted at it or ever offer to claim me again so i made no scruple to resolve to do it if i could and if my other friend stood to his bargain and i had a great deal of reason to be assured that he would stand to it by the letters he wrote to me which were the kindest and most obliging that could be i now grew big and the people where i lodged perceived it and began to take notice of it to me and as far as civility would allow intimated that i must think of removing this put me to extreme perplexity and i grew very melancholy for indeed i knew not what course to take i had money but no friends and was like to have a child upon my hands to keep which was a difficulty i had never had upon me yet as the particulars of my story hitherto make appear in the course of this affair i fell very ill and my melancholy really increased my distemper my illness proved at length to be only an ague but my apprehensions were really that i should miscarry i should not say apprehensions for indeed i would have been glad to miscarry but i could never be brought to entertain so much as a thought of endeavouring to miscarry or of taking any thing to make me miscarry i abhorred i say so much as the thought of it however speaking of it in the house the gentlewoman who kept the house proposed to me to send for a midwife i scrupled it at first but after some time consented to it but told her i had no particular acquaintance with any midwife and so left it to her it seems the mistress of the house was not so great a stranger to such cases as mine was as i thought at first she had been as will appear presently and she sent for a midwife of the right sort that is to say the right sort for me the woman appeared to be an experienced woman in her business i mean as a midwife but she had another calling too in which she was as expert as most women if not more my landlady had told her i was very melancholy and that she believed that had done me harm and once before me said to her mrs b meaning the midwif i believe this lady s trouble is of a kind that is pretty much in your way and therefore if you can do anything for her pray do for she is a very civil gentlewoman and so she went out of the room i really did not understand her but my mother midnight began very seriously to explain what she meant as soon as she was gone madam says she you seem not to understand what your landlady means and when you do understand it you need not let her know at all that you do so she means that you are under some circumstances that may render your lying in difficult to you and that you are not willing to be exposed i need say no more but to tell you that if you think fit to communicate so much of your case to me if it be so as is necessary for i do not desire to pry into those things i perhaps may be in a position to help you and to make you perfectly easy and remove all your dull thoughts upon that subject every word this creature said was a cordial to me and put new life and new spirit into my heart my blood began to circulate immediately and i was quite another body i ate my victuals again and grew better presently after it she said a great deal more to the same purpose and then having pressed me to be free with her and promised in the solemnest manner to be secret she stopped a little as if waiting to see what impression it made on me and what i would say i was too sensible to the want i was in of such a woman not to accept her offer i told her my case was partly as she guessed and partly not for i was really married and had a husband though he was in such fine circumstances and so remote at that time as that he could not appear publicly she took me short and told me that was none of her business all the ladies that came under her care were married women to her every woman she says that is with child has a father for it and whether that father was a husband or no husband was no business of hers her business was to assist me in my present circumstances whether i had a husband or no for madam says she to have a husband that cannot appear is to have no husband in the sense of the case and therefore whether you are a wife or a mistress is all one to me i found presently that whether i was a whore or a wife i was to pass for a whore here so i let that go i told her it was true as she said but that however if i must tell her my case i must tell it her as it was so i related it to her as short as i could and i concluded it to her thus i trouble you with all this madam said i not that as you said before it is much to the purpose in your affair but this is to the purpose namely that i am not in any pain about being seen or being public or concealed for tis perfectly indifferent to me but my difficulty is that i have no acquaintance in this part of the nation i understand you madam says she you have no security to bring to prevent the parish impertinences usual in such cases and perhaps says she do not know very well how to dispose of the child when it comes the last says i is not so much my concern as the first well madam answered the midwife dare you put yourself into my hands i live in such a place though i do not inquire after you you may inquire after me my name is b i live in such a street naming the street at the sign of the cradle my profession is a midwife and i have many ladies that come to my house to lie in i have given security to the parish in general terms to secure them from any charge from whatsoever shall come into the world under my roof i have but one question to ask in the whole affair madam says she and if that be answered you shall be entirely easy for all the rest i presently understood what she meant and told her madam i believe i understand you i thank god though i want friends in this part of the world i do not want money so far as may be necessary though i do not abound in that neither this i added because i would not make her expect great things well madam says she that is the thing indeed without which nothing can be done in these cases and yet says she you shall see that i will not impose upon you or offer anything that is unkind to you and if you desire it you shall know everything beforehand that you may suit yourself to the occasion and be neither costly or sparing as you see fit i told her she seemed to be so perfectly sensible of my condition that i had nothing to ask of her but this that as i had told her that i had money sufficient but not a great quantity she would order it so that i might be at as little superfluous charge as possible she replied that she would bring in an account of the expenses of it in two or three shapes and like a bill of fare i should choose as i pleased and i desired her to do so the next day she brought it and the copy of her three bills was as follows for three months lodging in her house including my diet at s a week s for a nurse for the month and use of childbed linen s for a minister to christen the child and to the godfathers and clerk s for a supper at the christening if i had five friends at it s for her fees as a midwife and the taking off the trouble of the parish s to her maid servant attending s s this was the first bill the second was the same terms for three months lodging and diet etc at s per week s for a nurse for the month and the use of linen and lace s for the minister to christen the child etc as above s for supper and for sweetmeats s for her fees as above s for a servantaid s s this was the secondate bill the third she said was for a degree higher and when the father or friends appeared for three months lodging and diet having two rooms and a garret for a servant s for a nurse for the month and the finest suit of childbed linen s for the minister to christen the child etc s for a supper the gentlemen to send in the wine s for my fees etc s the maid besides their own maid only s s i looked upon all three bills and smiled and told her i did not see but that she was very reasonable in her demands all things considered and for that i did not doubt but her accommodations were good she told me i should be judge of that when i saw them i told her i was sorry to tell her that i feared i must be her lowestated customer and perhaps madam said i you will make me the less welcome upon that account no not at all said she for where i have one of the third sort i have two of the second and four to one of the first and i get as much by them in proportion as by any but if you doubt my care of you i will allow any friend you have to overlook and see if you are well waited on or no then she explained the particulars of her bill in the first place madam said she i would have you observe that here is three months keeping you are but ten shillings a week i undertake to say you will not complain of my table i suppose says she you do not live cheaper where you are now no indeed said i not so cheap for i give six shillings per week for my chamber and find my own diet as well as i can which costs me a great deal more then madam says she if the child should not live or should be deadorn as you know sometimes happens then there is the minister s article saved and if you have no friends to come to you you may save the expense of a supper so that take those articles out madam says she your lying in will not cost you above s in all more than your ordinary charge of living this was the most reasonable thing that i ever heard of so i smiled and told her i would come and be her customer but i told her also that as i had two months and more to do i might perhaps be obliged to stay longer with her than three months and desired to know if she would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper no she said her house was large and besides she never put anybody to remove that had lain in till they were willing to go and if she had more ladies offered she was not so illeloved among her neighbours but she could provide accommodations for twenty if there was occasion i found she was an eminent lady in her way and in short i agreed to put myself into her hands and promised her she then talked of other things looked about into my accommodations where i was found fault with my wanting attendance and conveniences and that i should not be used so at her house i told her i was shy of speaking for the woman of the house looked stranger or at least i thought so since i had been ill because i was with child and i was afraid she would put some affront or other upon me supposing that i had been able to give but a slight account of myself oh dear said she her ladyship is no stranger to these things she has tried to entertain ladies in your condition several times but she could not secure the parish and besides she is not such a nice lady as you take her to be however since you are aoing you shall not meddle with her but i see you are a little better looked after while you are here than i think you are and it shall not cost you the more neither i did not understand her at all however i thanked her and so we parted the next morning she sent me a chicken roasted and hot and a pint bottle of sherry and ordered the maid to tell me that she was to wait on me every day as long as i stayed there this was surprisingly good and kind and i accepted it very willingly at night she sent to me again to know if i wanted anything and how i did and to order the maid to come to her in the morning with my dinner the maid had orders to make me some chocolate in the morning before she came away and did so and at noon she brought me the sweetbread of a breast of veal whole and a dish of soup for my dinner and after this manner she nursed me up at a distance so that i was mightily well pleased and quickly well for indeed my dejections before were the principal part of my illness i expected as is usually the case among such people that the servant she sent me would have been some imprudent brazen wench of drury lane breeding and i was very uneasy at having her with me upon that account so i would not let her lie in that house the first night by any means but had my eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a public thief my gentlewoman guessed presently what was the matter and sent her back with a short note that i might depend upon the honesty of her maid that she would be answerable for her upon all accounts and that she took no servants into her house without very good security for their fidelity i was then perfectly easy and indeed the maid s behaviour spoke for itself for a modester quieter soberer girl never came into anybody s family and i found her so afterwards as soon as i was well enough to go abroad i went with the maid to see the house and to see the apartment i was to have and everything was so handsome and so clean and well that in short i had nothing to say but was wonderfully pleased and satisfied with what i had met with which considering the melancholy circumstances i was in was far beyond what i looked for it might be expected that i should give some account of the nature of the wicked practices of this woman in whose hands i was now fallen but it would be too much encouragement to the vice to let the world see what easy measures were here taken to rid the women s unwelcome burthen of a child clandestinely gotten this grave matron had several sorts of practice and this was one particular that if a child was born though not in her house for she had occasion to be called to many private labour she had people at hand who for a piece of money would take the child off their hands and off from the hands of the parish too and those children as she said were honestly provided for and taken care of what should become of them all considering so many as by her account she was concerned with i cannot conceive i had many times discourses upon that subject with her but she was full of this argument that she save the life of many an innocent lamb as she called them which would otherwise perhaps have been murdered and of many women who made desperate by the misfortune would otherwise be tempted to destroy their children and bring themselves to the gallows i granted her that this was true and a very commendable thing provided the poor children fell into good hands afterwards and were not abused starved and neglected by the nurses that bred them up she answered that she always took care of that and had no nurses in her business but what were very good honest people and such as might be depended upon i could say nothing to the contrary and so was obliged to say madam i do not question you do your part honestly but what those people do afterwards is the main question and she stopped my mouth again with saying that she took the utmost care about it the only thing i found in all her conversation on these subjects that gave me any distaste was that one time in discouraging about my being far gone with child and the time i expected to come she said something that looked as if she could help me off with my burthen sooner if i was willing or in english that she could give me something to make me miscarry if i had a desire to put an end to my troubles that way but i soon let her see that i abhorred the thoughts of it and to do her justice she put it off so cleverly that i could not say she really intended it or whether she only mentioned the practice as a horrible thing for she couched her words so well and took my meaning so quickly that she gave her negative before i could explain myself to bring this part into as narrow a compass as possible i quitted my lodging at st jones s and went to my new governess for so they called her in the house and there i was indeed treated with so much courtesy so carefully looked to so handsomely provided and everything so well that i was surprised at it and could not at first see what advantage my governess made of it but i found afterwards that she professed to make no profit of lodgers diet nor indeed could she get much by it but that her profit lay in the other articles of her management and she made enough that way i assure you for tis scarce credible what practice she had as well abroad as at home and yet all upon the private account or in plain english the whoring account while i was in her house which was near four months she had no less than twelve ladies of pleasure brought to bed within the doors and i think she had twondhirty or thereabouts under her conduct without doors whereof one as nice as she was with me was lodged with my old landlady at st jones s this was a strange testimony of the growing vice of the age and such a one that as bad as i had been myself it shocked my very senses i began to nauseate the place i was in and about all the wicked practice and yet i must say that i never saw or do i believe there was to be seen the least indecency in the house the whole time i was there not a man was ever seen to come upstairs except to visit the lyingn ladies within their month nor then without the old lady with them who made it a piece of honour of her management that no man should touch a woman no not his own wife within the month nor would she permit any man to lie in the house upon any pretence whatever no not though she was sure it was with his own wife and her general saying for it was that she cared not how many children were born in her house but she would have none got there if she could help it it might perhaps be carried further than was needful but it was an error of the right hand if it was an error for by this she kept up the reputation such as it was of her business and obtained this character that though she did take care of the women when they were debauched yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at all and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too while i was there and before i was brought to bed i received a letter from my trustee at the bank full of kind obliging things and earnestly pressing me to return to london it was near a fortnight old when it came to me because it had been first sent into lancashire and then returned to me he concludes with telling me that he had obtained a decree i think he called it against his wife and that he would be ready to make good his engagement to me if i would accept of him adding a great many protestations of kindness and affection such as he would have been far from offering if he had known the circumstances i had been in and which as it was i had been very far from deserving i returned an answer to his letter and dated it at liverpool but sent it by messenger alleging that it came in cover to a friend in town i gave him joy of his deliverance but raised some scruples at the lawfulness of his marrying again and told him i supposed he would consider very seriously upon that point before he resolved on it the consequence being too great for a man of his judgment to venture rashly upon a thing of that nature so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolved without letting him into anything of my own mind or giving any answer to his proposal of my coming to london to him but mentioned at a distance my intention to return the latter end of the year this being dated in april i was brought to bed about the middle of may and had another brave boy and myself in as good condition as usual on such occasions my governess did her part as a midwife with the greatest art and dexterity imaginable and far beyond all that ever i had had any experience of before her care of me in my travail and after in my lying in was such that if she had been my own mother it could not have been better let none be encouraged in their loose practices from this dexterous lady s management for she is gone to her place and i dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up on it i think i had been brought to bed about twentywo days when i received another letter from my friend at the bank with the surprising news that he had obtained a final sentence of divorce against his wife and had served her with it on such a day and that he had such an answer to give to all my scruples about his marrying again as i could not expect and as he had no desire of for that his wife who had been under some remorse before for her usage of him as soon as she had the account that he had gained his point had very unhappily destroyed herself that same evening he expressed himself very handsomely as to his being concerned at her disaster but cleared himself of having any hand in it and that he had only done himself justice in a case in which he was notoriously injured and abused however he said that he was extremely afflicted at it and had no view of any satisfaction left in his world but only in the hope that i would come and relieve him by my company and then he pressed me violently indeed to give him some hopes that i would at least come up to town and let him see me when he would further enter into discourse about it i was exceedingly surprised at the news and began now seriously to reflect on my present circumstances and the inexpressible misfortune it was to me to have a child upon my hands and what to do in it i knew not at last i opened my case at a distance to my governess i appeared melancholy and uneasy for several days and she lay at me continually to know what trouble me i could not for my life tell her that i had an offer of marriage after i had so often told her that i had a husband so that i really knew not what to say to her i owned i had something which very much troubled me but at the same time told her i could not speak of it to any one alive she continued importuning me several days but it was impossible i told her for me to commit the secret to anybody this instead of being an answer to her increased her importunities she urged her having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature that it was her business to conceal everything and that to discover things of that nature would be her ruin she asked me if ever i had found her tattling to me of other people s affairs and how could i suspect her she told me to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody that she was silent as death that it must be a very strange case indeed that she could not help me out of but to conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible help or means of help and to deprive her of the opportunity of serving me in short she had such a bewitching eloquence and so great a power of persuasion that there was no concealing anything from her so i resolved to unbosom myself to her i told her the history of my lancashire marriage and how both of us had been disappointed how we came together and how we parted how he absolutely discharged me as far as lay in him free liberty to marry again protesting that if he knew it he would never claim me or disturb or expose me that i thought i was free but was dreadfully afraid to venture for fear of the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery then i told her what a good offer i had showed her my friend s two last letters inviting me to come to london and let her see with what affection and earnestness they were written but blotted out the name and also the story about the disaster of his wife only that she was dead she fell at my scruples about marrying and told me the other was no marriage but a cheat on both sides and that as we were parted by mutual consent the nature of the contract was destroyed and the obligation was mutually discharged she had arguments for this at the tip of her tongue and in short reasoned me out of my reason not but that it was too by the help of my own inclination but then came the great and main difficulty and that was the child this she told me in so many words must be removed and that so as that it should never be possible for any one to discover it i knew there was no marrying without entirely concealing that i had had a child for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was born nay and gotten too since my parley with him and that would have destroyed all the affair but it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with the child and for aught i knew of having it murdered or starved by neglect and illsage which was much the sam that i could not think of it without horror i wish all those women who consent to the disposing their children out of the way as it is called for decency sake would consider that tis only a contrived method for murder that is to say ailling their children with safety it is manifest to all that understand anything of children that we are born into the world helpless and incapable either to supply our own wants or so much as make them known and that without help we must perish and this help requires not only an assisting hand whether of the mother or somebody else but there are two things necessary in that assisting hand that is care and skill without both which half the children that are born would die nay though they were not to be denied food and one half more of those that remained would be cripples or fools lose their limbs and perhaps their sense i question not but that these are partly the reasons why affection was placed by nature in the hearts of mothers to their children without which they would never be able to give themselves up as tis necessary they should to the care and waking pains needful to the support of their children since this care is needful to the life of children to neglect them is to murder them again to give them up to be managed by those people who have none of that needful affection placed by nature in them is to neglect them in the highest degree nay in some it goes farther and is a neglect in order to their being lost so that tis even an intentional murder whether the child lives or dies all those things represented themselves to my view and that is the blackest and most frightful form and as i was very free with my governess whom i had now learned to call mother i represented to her all the dark thoughts which i had upon me about it and told her what distress i was in she seemed graver by much at this part than at the other but as she was hardened in these things beyond all possibility of being touched with the religious part and the scruples about the murder so she was equally impenetrable in that part which related to affection she asked me if she had not been careful and tender to me in my lying in as if i had been her own child i told her i owned she had well my dear says she and when you are gone what are you to me and what would it be to me if you were to be hanged do you think there are not women who as it is their trade and they get their bread by it value themselves upon their being as careful of children as their own mothers can be and understand it rather better yes yes child says she fear it not how were we nursed ourselves are you sure you was nursed up by your own mother and yet you look fat and fair child says the old beldam and with that she stroked me over the face never be concerned child says she going on in her drolling way i have no murderers about me i employ the best and the honestest nurses that can be had and have as few children miscarry under their hands as there would if they were all nursed by mothers we want neither care nor skill she touched me to the quick when she asked if i was sure that i was nursed by my own mother on the contrary i was sure i was not and i trembled and looked pale at the very expression sure said i to myself this creature cannot be a witch or have any conversation with a spirit that can inform her what was done with me before i was able to know it myself and i looked at her as if i had been frightened but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything about me that disorder went off and i began to be easy but it was not presently she perceived the disorder i was in but did not know the meaning of it so she ran on in her wild talk upon the weakness of my supposing that children were murdered because they were not all nursed by the mother and to persuade me that the children she disposed of were as well used as if the mothers had the nursing of them themselves it may be true mother says i for aught i know but my doubts are very strongly grounded indeed come then says she let s hear some of them why first says i you give a piece of money to these people to take the child off the parent s hands and to take care of it as long as it lives now we know mother said i that those are poor people and their gain consists in being quit of the charge as soon as they can how can i doubt but that as it is best for them to have the child die they are not over solicitous about life this is all vapours and fancy says the old woman i tell you their credit depends upon the child s life and they are as careful as any mother of you all o mother says i if i was but sure my little baby would be carefully looked to and have justice done it i should be happy indeed but it is impossible i can be satisfied in that point unless i saw it and to see it would be ruin and destruction to me as now my case stands so what to do i know not a fine story says the governess you would see the child and you would not see the child you would be concealed and discovered both together these are things impossible my dear so you must e en do as other conscientious mothers have done before you and be contented with things as they must be though they are not as you wish them to be i understood what she meant by conscientious mothers she would have said conscientious whores but she was not willing to disoblige me for really in this case i was not a whore because legally married the force of former marriage excepted however let me be what i would i was not come up to that pitch of hardness common to the profession i mean to be unnatural and regardless of the safety of my child and i preserved this honest affection so long that i was upon the point of giving up my friend at the bank who lay so hard at me to come to him and marry him that in short there was hardly any room to deny him at last my old governess came to me with her usual assurance come my dear says she i have found out a way how you shall be at a certainty that your child shall be used well and yet the people that take care of it shall never know you or who the mother of the child is oh mother says i if you can do so you will engage me to you for ever well says she are you willing to be a some small annual expense more than what we usually give to the people we contract with ay says i with all my heart provided i may be concealed as to that says the governess you shall be secure for the nurse shall never so much as dare to inquire about you and you shall once or twice a year go with me and see your child and see how tis used and be satisfied that it is in good hands nobody knowing who you are why said i do you think mother that when i come to see my child i shall be able to conceal my being the mother of it do you think that possible well well says my governess if you discover it the nurse shall be never the wiser for she shall be forbid to ask any questions about you or to take any notice if she offers it she shall lose the money which you are suppose to give her and the child shall be taken from her too i was very well pleased with this so the next week a countrywoman was brought from hertford or thereabouts who was to take the child off our hands entirely for in money but if i would allow a year more of her she would be obliged to bring the child to my governess s house as often as we desired or we should come down and look at it and see how well she used it the woman was very wholesomeooking a likely woman a cottager s wife but she had very good clothes and linen and everything well about her and with a heavy heart and many a tear i let her have my child i had been down at hertford and looked at her and at her dwelling which i liked well enough and i promised her great things if she would be kind to the child so she knew at first word that i was the child s mother but she seemed to be so much out of the way and to have no room to inquire after me that i thought i was safe enough so in short i consented to let her have the child and i gave her that is to say i gave it to my governess who gave it the poor woman before my face she agreeing never to return the child back to me or to claim anything more for its keeping or bringing up only that i promised if she took a great deal of care of it i would give her something more as often as i came to see it so that i was not bound to pay the only that i promised my governess i would do it and thus my great care was over after a manner which though it did not at all satisfy my mind yet was the most convenient for me as my affairs then stood of any that could be thought of at that time i then began to write to my friend at the bank in a more kindly style and particularly about the beginning of july i sent him a letter that i proposed to be in town some time in august he returned me an answer in the most passionate terms imaginable and desired me to let him have timely notice and he would come and meet me two day s journey this puzzled me scurvily and i did not know what answer to make of it once i resolved to take the stageoach to west chester on purpose only to have the satisfaction of coming back that he might see me really come in the same coach for i had a jealous thought though i had no ground for it at all lest he should think i was not really in the country and it was no illrounded thought as you shall hear presently i endeavoured to reason myself out of it but it was in vain the impression lay so strong on my mind that it was not to be resisted at last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the country that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess and would cover entirely all my other affairs for she did not know in the least whether my new lover lived in london or in lancashire and when i told her my resolution she was fully persuaded it was in lancashire having taken my measure for this journey i let her know it and sent the maid that tended me from the beginning to take a place for me in the coach she would have had me let the maid have waited on me down to the last stage and come up again in the waggon but i convinced her it would not be convenient when i went away she told me she would enter into no measures for correspondence for she saw evidently that my affection to my child would cause me to write to her and to visit her too when i came to town again i assured her it would and so took my leave well satisfied to have been freed from such a house however good my accommodations there had been as i have related above i took the place in the coach not to its full extent but to a place called stone in cheshire i think it is where i not only had no manner of business but not so much as the least acquaintance with any person in the town or near it but i knew that with money in the pocket one is at home anywhere so i lodged there two or three days till watching my opportunity i found room in another stageoach and took passage back again for london sending a letter to my gentleman that i should be such a certain day at stonytratford where the coachman told me he was to lodge it happened to be a chance coach that i had taken up which having been hired on purpose to carry some gentlemen to west chester who were going for ireland was now returning and did not tie itself to exact times or places as the stages did so that having been obliged to lie still on sunday he had time to get himself ready to come out which otherwise he could not have done however his warning was so short that he could not reach to stonytratford time enough to be with me at night but he met me at a place called brickhill the next morning as we were just coming in to tow i confess i was very glad to see him for i had thought myself a little disappointed overight seeing i had gone so far to contrive my coming on purpose he pleased me doubly too by the figure he came in for he brought a very handsome gentleman coach and four horses with a servant to attend him he took me out of the stageoach immediately which stopped at an inn in brickhill and putting into the same inn he set up his own coach and bespoke his dinner i asked him what he meant by that for i was for going forward with the journey he said no i had need of a little rest upon the road and that was a very good sort of a house though it was but a little town so we would go no farther that night whatever came of it i did not press him much for since he had come so to meet me and put himself to so much expense it was but reasonable i should oblige him a little too so i was easy as to that point after dinner we walked to see the town to see the church and to view the fields and the country as is usual for strangers to do and our landlord was our guide in going to see the church i observed my gentleman inquired pretty much about the parson and i took the hint immediately that he certainly would propose to be married and though it was a sudden thought it followed presently that in short i would not refuse him for to be plain with my circumstances i was in no condition now to say no i had no reason now to run any more such hazards but while these thoughts ran round in my head which was the work but of a few moments i observed my landlord took him aside and whispered to him though not very softly neither for so much i overheard sir if you shall have occasion the rest i could not hear but it seems it was to this purpose sir if you shall have occasion for a minister i have a friend a little way off that will serve you and be as private as you please my gentleman answered loud enough for me to hear very well i believe i shall i was no sooner come back to the inn but he fell upon me with irresistible words that since he had had the good fortune to meet me and everything concurred it would be hastening his felicity if i would put an end to the matter just there what do you mean says i colouring a little what in an inn and upon the road bless us all said i as if i had been surprised how can you talk so oh i can talk so very well says he i came aurpose to talk so and i show you that i did and with that he pulls out a great bundle of papers you fright me said i what are all these don t be frighted my dear said he and kissed me this was the first time that he had been so free to call me my dear then he repeated it don t be frighted you shall see what it is all then he laid them all abroad there was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his wife and the full evidence of her playing the whore then there were the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where she lived proving that she was buried and intimating the manner of her death the copy of the coroner s warrant for a jury to sit upon her and the verdict of the jury who brought it in non compos mentis all this was indeed to the purpose and to give me satisfaction though by the way i was not so scrupulous had he known all but that i might have taken him without it however i looked them all over as well as i could and told him that this was all very clear indeed but that he need not have given himself the trouble to have brought them out with him for it was time enough well he said it might be time enough for me but no time but the present time was time enough for him there were other papers rolled up and i asked him what they were why ay says he that s the question i wanted to have you ask me so he unrolls them and takes out a little shagreen case and gives me out of it a very fine diamond ring i could not refuse it if i had a mind to do so for he put it upon my finger so i made him a curtsy and accepted it then he takes out another ring and this says he is for another occasion so he puts that in his pocket well but let me see it though says i and smiled i guess what it is i think you are mad i should have been mad if i had done less says he and still he did not show me and i had a great mind to see it so i says well but let me see it hold says he first look here then he took up the roll again and read it and behold it was a licence for us to be married why says i are you distracted why you were fully satisfied that i would comply and yield at first word or resolved to take no denial the last is certainly the case said he but you may be mistaken said i no no says he how can you think so i must not be denied i can t be denied and with that he fell to kissing me so violently i could not get rid of him there was a bed in the room and we were walking to and again eager in the discourse at last he takes me by surprise in his arms and threw me on the bed and himself with me and holding me fast in his arms but without the least offer of any indecency courted me to consent with such repeated entreaties and arguments protesting his affection and vowing he would not let me go till i had promised him that at last i said why you resolve not to be denied indeed i can t be denied well well said i and giving him a slight kiss then you shan t be denied said i let me get up he was so transported with my consent and the kind manner of it that i began to think once he took it for a marriage and would not stay for the form but i wronged him for he gave over kissing me and then giving me two or three kisses again thanked me for my kind yielding to him and was so overcome with the satisfaction and joy of it that i saw tears stand in his eyes i turned from him for it filled my eyes with tears too and i asked him leave to retire a little to my chamber if ever i had a grain of true repentance for a vicious and abominable life for twentyour years past it was then on what a felicity is it to mankind said i to myself that they cannot see into the hearts of one another how happy had it been for me if i had been wife to a man of so much honesty and so much affection from the beginning then it occurred to me what an abominable creature am i and how is this innocent gentleman going to be abused by me how little does he think that having divorced a whore he is throwing himself into the arms of another that he is going to marry one that has lain with two brothers and has had three children by her own brother one that was born in newgate whose mother was a whore and is now a transported thief one that has lain with thirteen men and has had a child since he saw me poor gentleman said i what is he going to do after this reproaching myself was over it following thus well if i must be his wife if it please god to give me grace i be a true wife to him and love him suitably to the strange excess of his passion for me i will make him amends if possible by what he shall see for the cheats and abuses i put upon him which he does not see he was impatient for my coming out of my chamber but finding me long he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson my landlord an officious though welleaning fellow had sent away for the neighbouring clergyman and when my gentleman began to speak of it to him and talk of sending for him sir says he to him my friend is in the house so without any more words he brought them together when he came to the minister he asked him if he would venture to marry a couple of strangers that were both willing the parson said that mr had said something to him of it that he hoped it was no clandestine business that he seemed to be a grave gentleman and he supposed madam was not a girl so that the consent of friends should be wanted to put you out of doubt of that says my gentleman read this paper and out he pulls the license i am satisfied says the minister where is the lady you shall see her presently says my gentleman when he had said thus he comes upstairs and i was by that time come out of my room so he tells me the minister was below and that he had talked with him and that upon showing him the license he was free to marry us with all his heart but he asks to see you so he asked if i would let him come up tis time enough said i in the morning is it not why said he my dear he seemed to scruple whether it was not some young girl stolen from her parents and i assured him we were both of age to command our own consent and that made him ask to see you well said i do as you please so up they brings the parson and a merry good sort of gentleman he was he had been told it seems that we had met there by accident that i came in the chester coach and my gentleman in his own coach to meet me that we were to have met last night at stonytratford but that he could not reach so far well sir says the parson every ill turn has some good in it the disappointment sir says he to my gentleman was yours and the good turn is mine for if you had met at stonytratford i had not had the honour to marry you landlord have you a common prayer book i started as if i had been frightened lord sir says i what do you mean what to marry in an inn and at night too madam says the minister if you will have it be in the church you shall but i assure you your marriage will be as firm here as in the church we are not tied by the canons to marry nowhere but in the church and if you will have it in the church it will be a public as a county fair and as for the time of day it does not at all weigh in this case our princes are married in their chambers and at eight or ten o clock at night i was a great while before i could be persuaded and pretended not to be willing at all to be married but in the church but it was all grimace so i seemed at last to be prevailed on and my landlord and his wife and daughter were called up my landlord was father and clerk and all together and we were married and very merry we were though i confess the selfeproaches which i had upon me before lay close to me and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me which my bridegroom took notice of and endeavoured to encourage me thinking poor man that i had some little hesitations at the step i had taken so hastily we enjoyed ourselves that evening completely and yet all was kept so private in the inn that not a servant in the house knew of it for my landlady and her daughter waited on me and would not let any of the maids come upstairs except while we were at supper my landlady s daughter i called my bridesmaid and sending for a shopkeeper the next morning i gave the young woman a good suit of knots as good as the town would afford and finding it was a laceaking town i gave her mother a piece of boneace for a head one reason that my landlord was so close was that he was unwilling the minister of the parish should hear of it but for all that somebody heard of it so at that we had the bells set ainging the next morning early and the music such as the town would afford under our window but my landlord brazened it out that we were married before we came thither only that being his former guests we would have our weddingupper at his house we could not find in our hearts to stir the next day for in short having been disturbed by the bells in the morning and having perhaps not slept overmuch before we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in bed till almost twelve o clock i begged my landlady that we might not have any more music in the town nor ringing of bells and she managed it so well that we were very quiet but an odd passage interrupted all my mirth for a good while the great room of the house looked into the street and my new spouse being belowstairs i had walked to the end of the room and it being a pleasant warm day i had opened
