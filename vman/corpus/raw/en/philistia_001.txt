it was sunday evening and on sundays max schurz the chief of the london socialists always held his weekly receptions that night his cosmopolitan refugee friends were all at liberty his french disciples could pour in from the little lanes and courts in soho where since the commune they had plied their peaceful trades as engravers pictureramers artists olourmen models pointers and so forth or most of them were hangersn in one way or another of the artistic world his german adherents could stroll round pipe in mouth from their printingouses their hamndeef shops or their naturalists chambers where they stuffed birds or set up exotic butterflies in little cabinets or most of them were more or less literary or scientific in their pursuits and his few english sympathisers chiefly dissatisfied philosophical radicals of the upper classes could drop in casually for a chat and a smoke on their way home from the churches to which they had been dutifully escorting their unmancipated wives and sisters max schurz kept open house for all on sunday evenings and there was not a drawingoom in london better filled than his with the very advanced and not undistinguished set who alone had the muchrized entr e of his exclusive salon the salon itself did not form any component part of max schurz own private residence in any way the great socialist the man whose mandates shook the thrones of russia and austria whose movements spread terror in paris and berlin whose dictates were even obeyed in kerry and in chicago occupied for his own use two small rooms at the top of a shabby composite tenement in a doubtful district of marylebone the little parlour where he carried on his trade of a microscopeens grinder would not have sufficed to hold oneenth of the eager halfashed crowd that pressed itself enthusiastically upon him every sunday but a large room on the ground floor of the tenement opening towards the main street was used during the week by one of his french refugee friends as a dancingaloon and in this room on every sunday evening the uncrowned king of the proletariate socialists was permitted to hold his royal levees thither all that was best and truest in the socially rebellions classes domiciled in london used to make its way and there men calmly talked over the ultimate chances of social revolutions which would have made the hair of respectable philistine marylebone stand stiffly on end had it only known the rank political heresies that were quietly hatching in its unconscious midst while max schurz hall was rapidly filling with the polyglot crowd of democratic solidarists ernest le breton and his brother were waiting in the chilly little drawingoom at epsilon terrace bayswater for the expected arrival of harry oswald ernest had promised to introduce oswald to max schurz reception and it was now past eight olock getting rather a late hour for those simpleinded earlyising communists afraid herbert said ernest to his brother e forgets that max is a workingan who has to be at his trade again punctually by seven olock toorrow he thinks he going out to a regular society at home where ten olock considered just the beginning of the evening max won at all like his turning up so late it smells of nonroductivity f herr schurz wants to convert the world herbert answered chillily rolling himself a tiny cigarette e must convince the unproductive as well as the proletariate before he can set things fairly on the roll for better arrangement the proletariate all very well in its way no doubt but the unproductive happen to hold the key of the situation one convert like you or me is worth a thousand ignorant eastnd labourers with nothing but their hands and their votes to count upon ut you are not a convert herbert didn say i was i a critic there no necessity to throw oneself openrmed into the embrace of either party the wise man can wait and watch the progress of the game backing the winner for the time being at all the critical moments and hedging if necessary when the chances turn momentarily against the favourite there a ring at the bell that oswald let go down to the door to meet him ernest ran down the stairs rapidly as was his wont herbert followed in a more leisurely fashion still rolling the cigarette between his delicate finger and thumb gracious oswald ernest exclaimed as his friend stepped in hy youe actually come in evening dress a white tie and all what on earth will max say hel be perfectly scandalised at such a shocking and unprecedented outrage this will never do you must dissemble somehow or other oswald laughed had no idea he said err schurz was such a truculent sansulotte as that comes to as it was an evening reception i thought of course one ought to turn up in evening clothes vening clothes my dear fellow how on earth do you suppose a set of poor leicester square outlaws are going to get themselves correctly set up in black broadcloth coats and trousers they might wash their white ties themselves to be sure they mostly do their own washing i believe in their own basins nd not much at that either put in herbert parenthetically ut as to evening clothes why they as soon think of arraying themselves for dinner in full court dress as of putting on an obscurantist swallowail it the badge of a class a distinct aristocratic outrage we must alter it at once i assure you oswald t any rate said oswald laughing e had the pleasure of finding myself accused for the first time in the course of my existence of being aristocratic it quite worth while going to max schurz once in one life if it were only for the sake of that single new sensation ell my dear fellow we must rectify you anyhow before you go let me see luckily youe got your dustoat on and you needn take that off itl do splendidly to hide your coat and waistcoat il lend you a blue tie which will at once transform your upper man entirely but you show the cloven hoof below the trousers will surely betray you theye absolutely inadmissible under any circumstances whatsoever as the court circular says and you must positively wear a coloured pair of herbert instead of them run upstairs quickly there a good fellow and get rid of the mark of the beast as fast as you can oswald did as he was told without demur and in about a minute more presented himself again with the mark of the beast certainly most effectually obliterated at least so far as outer appearance went his blue tie light dustoat and borrowed grey trousers made up an ensemble much more like an omnibus conductor out for a holiday than a gentleman of the period in correct evening dress ow mind ernest said seriously as he opened the door hatever you do oswald if you stew to death for it nd schurz rooms are often very close and hot i can assure you on for heaven sake go and unbutton your dustoat if you do theyl see at once youe a wolf in sheep clothing and i shouldn be at all surprised if they were to turn and rend you at least i sure max would be very much annoyed with me for unsocially introducing a plutocratic traitor into the bosom of the fold they walked along briskly in the direction of marylebone and stopped at last at a dull yellowashed house which bore on its door a very dingy brass plate inscribed in red letters et mdlle tirard salon de danse ernest opened the door without ringing and turned down the passage towards the salon emember he said turning to harry oswald by way of a last warning with his hand on the inner doorandle o te que co te my dear fellow don on any account open your dustoat no antiocial opinions and please bear in mind that max is in his own way a potentate the big hall badly lighted by a few contribution candles for the whole colony subscribed to the best of its ability for the support of the weekly entertainmen was all alive with eager figures and the mingled busy hum of earnest conversation a few chairs ranged round the wall were mostly occupied by mdlle tirard and the other ladies of the socialist party but the mass of the guests were men and they were almost all smoking in utter indifference to the scanty presence of the fair sex not that they were intentionally rude or boorish that they never were except where an emperor or an aristocrat is concerned there is no being on earth more courteous kindly and considerate for the feelings of others than your exiled socialist he has suffered much himself in his own time and so miseris succurrere discit emperors he mentally classes with cobras tarantulas and scorpions as outside the pale of humanitarian sympathies altogether but with this slight political exception he is the broadest and tenderest and most catholic in his feelings of all living breathing creatures however the ladies of his party have all been brought up from their childhood onward in a mingled atmosphere of smoke and democracy so that he no more thinks of abstaining from tobacco in their presence than he thinks of commiserating the poor fish for being so dreadfully wet or the unfortunate mole for his unpleasantly slimy diet of live earthworms err schurz said ernest singling out the great leader in the gloom immediately e brought my brother herbert here whom you know already to see you as well as another oxford friend of mind mr harry oswald fellow and lecturer of oriel he almost one of us at heart i happy to say and at any rate i sure youl be glad to make his acquaintance the little spare wizenedp grey man in the threadbare brown velveteen jacket who stood in the middle of the hall caught ernest hand warmly and held it for a moment fettered in his iron grip there was an honesty in that grip and in those hazy bluepectacled eyes that nobody could for a second misunderstand if an emperor had been introduced to max schurz he might have felt a little abashed one minute at the old socialist royal disdain but he could not have failed to say to himself as he looked at him from head to foot ere at least is a true man so harry oswald felt as the spare grey thinker took his hand in his and grasped it firmly with a kindly pressure but less friendly than that with which he had greeted his known admirer ernest le breton as for herbert he merely bowed to him politely from a little distance and herbert who had picked up at once with a polish exile in a corner returned the bow frigidly without coming up to the host himself at all for a moment welcome always pleased to meet friends of the cause from oxford herr schurz said in almost perfect english e want recruits most of all among the thinking classes if we are ever to make headway against the banded monopolies gainst the placeolders the landrabbers the labouraxers the robbers of the poor e must first secure the perfect undivided confidence of the brainorkers the thinkers and the writers at present everything is against us we are but a little leaven trying vainly in our helpless fashion to leaven the whole lump the capitalist journals carry off all the writing talent in the world they are timid as capital must always be they tremble for their tens of thousands a year and their vast circulations among the propertied classes we cannot get at the heart of the people save by the archimedean lever of the thinking world for that reason my dear le breton i am always glad to muster here your oxford neophytes nd yet herr schurz said ernest gently ou know we must not after all despair look at the history of your own people when the cause of jehovah seemed most hopeless there were still seven thousand left in israel who had not bowed the knee to baal we are gaining strength every day while they are losing it h yes my friend i know that too the old man answered with a solemn shake of the head ut the wheels move slowly they move slowly ery surely but oh so slowly you are young friend ernest and i am growing old you look forward to the future with hope i look back to the past with regret so many years gone so little so very little done it will come it will come as surely as the next glacial period but i shall not live to see it i stand like moses on pisgah i see the promised land before me i look down upon the equally allotted vineyards and the glebe flowing with milk and honey in the distance but i shall not lead you into it i shall not even lead you against the canaanites another than i must lead you in but i am an old man mr oswald an old man now and i am talking all about myself n antiocial trick we have inherited from our fathers what is your friend special line at oxford did you say ernest swald is a mathematician sir said ernest erhaps the greatest mathematician among the younger men in the whole university h that is well we want exact science we want clear and definite thinking biologists and physicists and mathematicians those are our best recruits you may depend upon it we need logic not mere gas our french friends and our irish friends have nothing in the world to say against them they are useful men ardent men full of fire full of enthusiasm ready to do and dare anything ut they lack ballast you can take the kingdom of heaven by storm the social revolution is not to be accomplished by violence it is not even to be carried by the most vivid eloquence the victory will be in the end to the clearest brain and the subtlest intellect the orthodox political economists are clever sophists they mask and confuse the truth very speciously we must have keen eyes and sharp noses to spy out and scent out their tortuous fallacies i glad youe a mathematician mr oswald and so you have thought on social problems have read gold and the proletariate oswald answered modestly nd i learned much from it and thought more i won say you have quite converted me herr schurz but you have given me plenty of food for future reflection hat is well said the old man passing one skinny brown hand gently up and down over the other hat is well there no hurry don make up your mind too fast don jump at conclusions it intellectual dishonesty to do that wait till you have convinced yourself spell out your problems slowly they are not easy ones try to see how the present complex system works try to probe its inequalities and injustices try to compare it with the ideal commonwealth and youl find the light in the end youl find the light as he spoke herbert le breton lounged up quietly from his farther corner towards the little group h your brother ernest said max schurz drawing himself up a little more stiffly e has found the light already i believe but he neglects it still he is not with us and he that is not with us is against us you hold aloof always mr herbert is it not so ell not quite aloof herr schurz i certain but not on your side exactly either i like to look on and hold the balance evenly not to throw my own weight too lightly into either stale the objective attitude of the mere spectator is after all the right one for an impartial philosopher to take up h mr herbert this philosophy of your oxford contemplative radicals is only another name for a kind of social selfishness i fancy said the old man solemnly t seems to me your head is with us but your heart your heart is elsewhere herbert le breton played a moment quietly with the roman aureus of domitian on his watchhain then he said slowly in his clear cold voice here may be something in that no doubt herr schurz for each of us has his own game to play and while the world remains unreformed he must play it on his own gambit to a great extent without reference to the independent game of others we all agree that the board is too full of counters and as each counter is not responsible for its own presence and position on the board having been put there without previous consultation by the players we must each do the best we can for ourselves in our own fashion my sympathies as you say are on your side but perhaps my interests lie the other way and after all till you start your millennium we must all rattle along as well as we can in the box together jarring against one another in our old ugly round of competition and supply and demand and survival of the fittest and mutual accommodation and all the rest of it to the end of the chapter every man for himself and god for us all you know you have the logic to be sure herr schurz but the monopolists have the law and the money h yes said the old socialist grimly emas demas he and his silver mine you remember your bunyan don you well all faiths and systems have their demases the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches he bursar of his college isn he ernest i thought so he had the bag and bare what was put therein a dangerous office isn it mr oswald a very dangerous office you can touch pitch or property without being defiled ou at least sir said ernest reverentially ave kept yourself unspotted from the world the old man sighed and turned for a moment to speak in french to a tall bigearded newomer who advanced to meet him mpossible he said quickly am truly distressed to hear it it is very imprudent very unnecessary hat is the news asked ernest also in french the newomer answered him with a marked south russian accent here has been another attempt on the life of alexander nicolaiovitch ou don mean to say so cried ernest in surprise es i do replied the russian nd it has nearly succeeded too n attempt on whom asked oswald who was new to the peculiar vocabulary of the socialists and not particularly accustomed to following spoken french n alexander nicolaiovitch answered the redearded stranger ot the czar oswald inquired of ernest es the one whom you call czar said the stranger quickly in tolerable english the confusion of tongues seemed to be treated as a small matter at max schurz receptions for everybody appeared to speak all languages at once in the true spirit of solidarity as though babel had never been oswald did not attempt to conceal a slight gesture of horror the tall russian looked down upon him commiseratingly e is of the few he asked of ernest that being the slang of the initiated for a member of the aristocratic and capitalist oligarchy ot exactly ernest answered with a smile ut he has not entirely learned the way we here regard these penal measures his sympathies are oneided as to alexander no doubt he thinks merely of the hunted wretched life the man bears about with him and he forgets poor bleeding groaning downrodden longuffering russia it is the common way of englishmen they do not realise siberia and poland and the third section and all the rest of it they think only of alexander as of the benevolent despot who freed the serf and befriended the bulgarian they never remember that they have all the freedom and privileges themselves which you poor russians ask for in vain they do not bear in mind that he has only to sign his name to a constitution a very little constitution and he might walk abroad as lightearted in st petersburg toorrow as you and i walk in regent street toay we are mostly lopsided we english but you must bear with us in our obliquity we have had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due allowance for those unfortunate folks who are still in search of it f you had an alexander yourselves for half a day the russian said fiercely turning to oswald ou would soon see the difference you would forget your virtuous indignation against nihilist assassins in the white heat of your anger against unendurable tyranny you had a king charles in england once he mere shadow of a russian czar nd you were not so very ceremonious with him you orderoving english after all t is a foolish thing borodinsky said max schurz looking up from the long telegram the other had handed him nd i told toroloff as much a fortnight ago when he spoke to me about the matter you can do no good by these constant attacks and you only rouse the minds of the oligarchy against you by your importunity bloodshed will avail us nothing the world cannot be regenerated by a baptism like that every peasant won over every student enrolled every mother engaged to feed her little ones on the gospel of socialism together with her own milk is worth a thousand times more to us and to the people than a dead czar if your friends had really blown him up what then you would have had another czar and another third section and another reign of terror and another raid and massacre and we should have lost twenty good men from our poor little side for ever we must not waste the salt of the earth in that reckless fashion besides i don like this dynamite it a bad argument it smacks too much of the old royal and repressive method you know the motto louis quatorze used to cast on his bronze cannon ultima ratio regum well we socialists ought to be able to find better logic for our opponents than that oughtn we ut in russia cried the bearded man hotly n poor strickenown groaning russia what other argument have they left us are we to be hunted to death without real law or trial tortured into sham confessions deluded with mock pardons arraigned before hypocritical tribunals ensnared by all the chicanery and lying and treachery and ferreting of the false bureaucracy with its spies and its bloodhounds and its knoutearing policegents and then are we not to make war the only way we can pen war mind you with fair declaration and due formalities and proper warning beforehand gainst the irresponsible autocrat and his wireulled officeuppets who kill us off mercilessly you are too hard upon us herr schurz even you yourself have no sympathy at all for unhappy russia the old man looked up at him tenderly and regretfully y poor borodinsky he said in a gentle tremulous voice have indeed sympathy and pity in abundance for you i do not blame you you will have enough and to spare to do that even here in free england i would not say a harsh word against you or your terrible methods for all the world you have been hardriven and you stand at bay like tigers but i think you are going to work the wrong way not using your energies to the best possible advantage for the proletariate what we have really got to do is to gain over every man woman and child of the workinglasses individually and to array on our side all the learning and intellect and economical science of the thinking classes individually and then we can present such a grand united front to the banded monopolists that for very shame they will not dare to gainsay us indeed if it comes to that we can leave them quietly alone till for pure hunger they will come and beg our assistance when we have enticed away all the workmen from their masters to our coperative factories the masters may keep their rusty empty mills and looms and engines to themselves as long as they like but they must come to us in the end and ask us to give them the bread they used to refuse us for my part i would kill no man and rob no man but i would let no man kill or rob another either nd how about alexander nicolaiovitch then persisted the russian eagerly as he killed none in his loathsome prisons and in his siberian quicksilver mines has he robbed none of their own hardly got earnings by his poisoned vodki and his autocratically imposed taxes and imposts who gave him an absolute hereditary right to put us to death to throw us in prison to take our money from us against our will and without our leave to treat us as if we existed body and soul and wives and children only as chattels for the greater glory of his own orthodox imperial majesty if we may justly slay the highway robber who meets us arms in hand in the outskirts of the city and demands of us our money or our life may we not justly slay alexander nicolaiovitch who comes to our homes in the person of his taxatherers to take the bread out of our children mouths and to help himself to whatever he chooses by the divine right of his romanoff heirship i tell you herr max we may blamelessly lie in wait for him wherever we find him and whoso says us nay is siding with the wolf against the lambs with the robber and the slayer against the honest representative of right and justice never met a nihilist before said oswald to ernest in a halfndertone and it never struck me to think what they might have to say for themselves from their own side of the question hat one of the uses of coming here to herr schurz ernest answered quickly ou may not agree with all you hear but at least you learn to see others as they see themselves whereas if you always in english society and read only english papers you will see them only as we english see them ut just fancy oswald went on as they both stood back a little to make way for others who wished for interviews with the great man ust fancy that this borodinsky or whatever his name may be has himself very likely helped in dynamite plots or manufactured nitrolycerine cartridges to blow up the czar and yet we stand here talking with him as coolly as if he were an ordinary respectable innocent englishman hat of that ernest answered smiling idn we meet prince strelinoffsky at oriel last term and didn we talk with him too as if he was an honest hardorking breadarning christian and yet we knew he was a member of the st petersburg office clique and at the bottom of half the trouble in poland for the last ten years or so grant even that borodinsky is quite wrong in his way of dealing with noxious autocrats and yet which do you think is the worst criminal of the two e with his little honest glazier shop in a back slum of paddington or strelinoffsky with his jewelled fingers calmly signing accursed warrants to send childing polish women to die of cold and hunger and illreatment on the way to siberia ell really le breton you know i a passably good radical but youe positively just one stage too radical even for me ome here oftener answered ernest nd perhaps youl begin to think a little differently about some things an hour later in the evening max schurz found ernest alone in a quiet corner ne moment my dear le breton he said ou know i always like to find out all about people political antecedents it helps one to fathom the potentialities of their characters from what social stratum now do we get your clever friend mr oswald is father a petty tradesman in a country town in devonshire i believe ernest answered nd he himself is a good general democrat without any very pronounced socialistic colouring petty tradesman hum i thought so he has rather the mental bearing and equipment of a man from the petite bourgeoisie i have been talking to him and drawing him out clever very and with good instincts but not wholly and entirely sound a fibre wrong somewhere socially speaking a false note suspected in his ideas of life too much acquiescence in the thing that is and too little faith or enthusiasm for the thing that ought to be but we shall make something of him yet he has read gold and understands it that is already a beginning bring him again i shall always be glad to see him here will said ernest nd i believe the more you know him herr max the better you will like him nd what did you think of the sons of the prophets asked herbert le breton of oswald as they left the salon at the close of the reception rankly speaking answered oswald looking half aside at ernest didn quite care for all of them he nihilists and communards took my breath away at first but as to max schurz himself i think there can be only one opinion possible about him nd that is hat he a magnificent old man with a genuine apostolic inspiration i don care twopence whether he is right or wrong but he a perfectly splendid old fellow as honest and transparent as the day long he believes in it all and would give his life for it freely if he thought he could forward the cause a single inch by doing it oue quite right said herbert calmly e an elijah thrown blankly upon these prosaic latter days and what more his gospel all true but it doesn matter a sou to you or me for it will never come about in our time no nor for a century after post nos millennium so what on earth the good of our troubling our poor overworked heads about it e the only really great man i ever knew said ernest enthusiastically nd i consider that his friendship the one thing in my life that has been really and truly worth living for if a pessimist were to ask me what was the use of human existence i should give him a card of introduction to go to max schurz xcuse my interrupting your rhapsody ernest herbert put in blandly ut will you have your own trousers tonight oswald or will you wear mine back to your lodgings now and il send one of the servants round with yours for them in the morning hanks said harry oswald slapping the sides of the unopened dustoat think il go home as i am at present and il recover the marks of the beast again toorrow you see i didn betray my evening waistcoat after all now did i and they parted at the corner each of them going his own way in his own mood and manner chapter the coasts of the gentiles the decayed and disfranchised borough of calcombe pomeroy or calcombenheea is one of the prettiest and quietest little outfheay wateringlaces in the whole smiling southern slope of the county of devon thank heaven the great western railway when planning its organised devastations along the beautiful rural region of the south hams left poor little calcombe out in the cold and the consequence is that those few people who still love to linger in the uncontaminated rustic england of our wiser forefathers can here find a beach unspoiled by goatarriages or blackaced minstrels a tiny parade uninvaded by stucco terraces or german brass bands and an ancient stone pier off which swimmers may take a header direct in the early morning before the sumptuary edicts of his worship the mayor compel them to resort to the use of bathingachines and the decent covering of an approved costume between the hours of eight and eight a board beside the mouth of the harbour signed by a secretary of state to his late majesty king william the fourth still announces to a heedless world the tolls to be paid for entry by the ships that never arrive and a superannuated official in a wooden leg and a gold capand retains the honourable sinecure of a harbourastership with a hypothetical salary nominally payable from the nonxistent fees and port dues the little river cale at the bottom of whose combe the wee town nestles snugly has cut itself a deep valley in the soft sandstone hills and the gap in the cliffs formed by its mouth gives room for the few hundred yards of level on which the antiquated little parade is warmly ensconced on either hand tall bluffs of brilliant red marl raise their honeycombed faces fronting the sea and in the distance the sheeny grey rocks of the harder devonian promontories gleam like watered satin in the slant rays of the afternoon sun altogether a very sleepy little oldorld place is calcombe pomeroy specially reserved by the overruling chance of the universe to be a summer retreat for quiet peaceoving oldorld people the londoner who escapes for a while from the great teeming human antill with its dark foggy lanes and solid firmament of hanging smoke to draw in a little unadulterated atmosphere at calcombe pomeroy finds himself landed by the plymouth slow train at calcombe road station twelve miles by crossountry highway from his final destination the little grey box described in the timeables as a commodious omnibus which takes him on for the rest of his journey crawls slowly up the first six miles to the summit of the intervening range at the cross foxes inn and jolts swiftly down the other six miles with red hot drag creaking and groaning lugubriously till it seems to topple over sheer into the sea at the clambering high street of the old borough as you turn to descend the seaward slope at the cross foxes you appear to leave modern industrial england and the nineteenth century well behind you on the north and you go down into a little isolated primaeval dale cut off from all the outer world by the high ridge that girds it round on every side and turned only on the southern front towards the open channel and the backing sun halfay down the steep cobbleaved high street just after you pass the big dull russet church a small shop on the leftand side bears a signboard with the painted legend swald family grocer and provision dealer in the front bay window of that redrick house built out just over the shop harry oswald fellow and lecturer of oriel college oxford kept his big oak writingesk and at that desk he might be seen reading or writing on most mornings during the long vacation after the end of his three weeks stay at a london westnd lodgingouse from which he had paid his first visit to max schurz sunday evening receptions wo pounds of best black tea good quality ours is generally atrocious mrs oswald hat the next thing on the list said poor trembling shaky miss luttrell the squire sister a palsied old lady with a quavering querulous rasping voice wo pounds of best black tea and mind you don send it all dust as you usually do no good tea to be got nowadays since they took the duties off and ruined the country and i see a tall young man lounging about the place sometimes and never touching his hat to me as he ought to do young people have no manners in these times mrs oswald as they used to have when you and i were young your son i suppose come home from sea or something he in the fishuring line isn he i think ie heard you say don rightly know who e may mean miss luttrell replied the mother proudly y a young man lounging about the place but my son at home from oxford at present for his vacations and he isn in the fishuring line at all mam but he a fellow of his college as ie told e more than once already but youe getting old i see miss luttrell and your memory isn just what it had used to be dost know h at oxford is he miss luttrell chimed on vacantly wagging her wrinkled old head in solemn deprecation of the evil omen she knew it as well as mrs oswald herself did having heard the fact at least a thousand times before but she made it a matter of principle never to encourage these upstart pretensions on the part of the lower orders and just to keep them rigorously at their proper level she always made a feint of forgetting any steps in advance which they might have been bold enough to take without humbly obtaining her previous permission out of their original and natural obscurity ellow of his college is he really fellow of a college dear me how completely oxford is going to the dogs admitting all kinds of odd people into the university i understand why my second brother he archdeacon you know as a fellow of magdalen for some time in his younger days you surprise me quite fellow of a college youe perfectly sure he isn a national schoolmaster at oxford instead and that you and his father haven got the two things mixed up together in your heads mrs oswald o mam wen perfectly sure of it and we haven got the things mixed up in our heads at all no more nor you have miss luttrell he was a scholar of trinity first and now he got a fellowship at oriel you must mind hearing all about it at the time only youe getting so forgetful like now with years and such like mrs oswald knew there was nothing that annoyed the old lady so much as any allusion to her increasing age or infirmities and she took her revenge out of her in that simple retributive fashion scholar of trinity was he ah yes patronage will do a great deal in these days for certain the rector took a wonderful interest in your boy i think mrs oswald he went to plymouth grammar school i remember now with a nomination no doubt and there i dare say he attracted some attention being a decent hardorking lad and got sent to oxford with a sizarship or something of the sort there are all kinds of arrangements like that at the universities i believe to encourage poor young men of respectable character they become missionaries or ushers in the end and often get very good salaries considering everything i told here youe wrong again mam put in mrs oswald stoutly y husband he sent harry to plymouth school at our own expense and after that he got an exhibition from the school and an open scholarship i think they call it at the college and he been no more beholden to patronage mam than your brother the archdeacon was nor for the matter o that not so much neither for ie understood the old squire sent him first to the charterhouse and afterwards he got a living through lord modbury influence as the squire voted regular with the modbury people for the borough and county but george was always independent miss luttrell and beholden to neither luttrells nor modburies and that i tell e to your face mam and no shame of it either ell well mrs oswald said the old lady shaking her head more violently than ever at this direct discomfiture don want to argue with you about the matter i dare say your son a very worthy young man and has worked his way up into a position he wasn intended for by providence but it no business of mine thank heaven it no business of mine for i not responsible for all the vagaries of all the tradespeople on my brother estate nor don want to be there mrs figgins now the baker wife her daughter has just chosen to get married to a bank clerk in london and i said to her this morning well mrs figgins so youe let your polly go and pick up with some young fellow from town that youe never seen before haven you and that the way of all you people you marry your girls to bank clerks without a reference for the sake of getting off your hands and what the consequence they rob their employers to keep up a pretty household for their wives as if they were fine ladies and then at last the thing discovered there comes a smash they run away to america and you have your daughters and their children thrown back again penniless upon your hands that what i said to her mrs oswald and how your daughter by the way emima i think you call her how she eh tell me beg your pardon miss luttrell but her name not jemima it edith h edith is it well to be sure the grand names girls have dangling about with them nowadays my name plain catherine and it good enough for me thank goodness but these young ladies of the new style must be ediths and eleanors and ophelias and all that heathenish kind of thing as if they were princesses of the blood or playctresses instead of being good christian susans and janes and betties like their grandmothers were before them and miss edith now what is she doing he doing nothing in particular at this moment miss luttrell leastways not so far as i know of but she going up to oxford part of this term on a visit to her brother oing up to oxford my good woman why heaven bless the girl she much better stop at home and learn her catechism she should try to do her duty in that station of life to which it has pleased providence to call her instead of running after young gentlemen above her own rank and place in society at oxford tell her so from me mrs oswald and mind you don send the tea dusty two pounds of your best if you please as soon as you can send it goodorning and miss luttrell having discovered the absolute truth of the shocking rumour which had reached her about edith projected visit the confirmation of which was the sole object of her colloquy wagged her way out of the shop again successfully and was duly assisted by the pageoy into her shambling little palsied donkeyhair hat was all the old cat came about you warrt you muttered mr oswald himself from behind his biscuitoxes ust have heard it from the rector wife and wanted to find out if it was true to go and tell mrs walters o such a bit o turble presumptiousness meanwhile in the little study with the bowindow over the shop harry and edie oswald were busily discussing the necessary preparations for edie longromised visit to the university hope youe got everything nice in the way of dress you know edie said harry oul want a decent dinner dress of course for youl be asked out to dine at least once or twice and i want you to have everything exceedingly proper and pretty think ie got all i need in that way harry ie my dark poplin cut square in the bodice for one dinner dress and my high black silk to fall back upon for another worn open in front with a lace handkerchief and a locket it does really very nicely then ie got three afternoon dresses the grey you gave me the sagereeny aesthetic one and the peacocklue with the satin boxleats it a charming dress the peacocklue it looks as if it might have stepped straight out of a genuine titian it came home from miss wells this morning wait five minutes like a dear boy and il run and put it on and let you see me in it hat a good girl do i so anxious you should have all your clothes the exact pink of perfection popsy though i afraid i a very poor critic in that matter f you were only a problem in space of four dimensions now yet after all every man or woman is more of a problem than anything in square plus y square you can possibly set yourself edie ran lightly up into her own room and soon reappeared clad resplendent in the new peacocklue dress with hat and parasol to match and a little creamy lambool scarf thrown with artful carelessness around her pretty neck and shoulders harry looked at her with unfeigned admiration indeed you would not easily find many lighter or more fairlyike little girls than edie oswald even in the beautiful halfeltic south hams of devon in figure she was rather small than short for though she was but a wee thing her form was so exactly and delicately modelled that she might have looked tall if she stood alone at a little distance she never walked but seemed to dance about from place to place so buoyant and light that harry doubted whether in her case gravitation could really vary as the square of the distance t seemed in fact to be almost diminished in the proportions of the cube her hair and eyes uch big bright eyes ere dark but her complexion was scarcely brunette and the colour in her cheeks was rich and peachike after the true devonian type she was dimpled whenever she smiled and she smiled often her full lips giving a peculiar ripe look to her laughing mouth that suited admirably with her light and delicate style of beauty perhaps some people might have thought them too full certainly they irresistibly suggested to a critical eye the distinct notion of kissability as she stood there faintly blushing waiting to be admired by her brother in her neatly fitting dainty blue dress her lips half parted and her arms held carelessly at her side she looked about as much like a fairy picture as it is given to mere human flesh and blood to look t delicious edie said harry surveying her from head to foot with a smile of satisfaction which made her blush deepen t simply delicious where on earth did you get the idea of it ell it partly the present style said edie ut i took the notion of the bodice partly too from that vandyck you know in the palazzo bossi at genoa remember i remember harry answered contemplating her with an admiring eye ow just turn round and show me how it sits behind edie you recollect th ophile gautier says the one great advantage which a beautiful woman possesses over a beautiful statue is this that while a man has to walk round the beautiful statue in order to see it from every side he can ask the beautiful woman to turn herself round and let him see her without requiring to take that trouble h ophile gautier was a horrid man and if anybody but my brother quoted such a thing as that to me i should be very angry with him indeed h ophile gautier was quite as horrid as you consider him to be and if you were anybody but my sister it isn probable i should have quoted him to you but if there is any statue on earth prettier or more graceful than you are in that dress at this moment edie then the venus of milo ought immediately to be pulverised to ultimate atoms for a rank artistic impostor hank you harry for the compliment what pretty things you must be capable of saying to somebody else sister when youe so polite and courtly to your own n the contrary popsy when it comes to somebody else sister i much too nervous and funky to say anything of the kind but you must at least do gautier the justice to observe that if i had described a circle round you instead of allowing you to revolve once on your own axis i shouldn have been able to get the gloss on the satin in the sunlight as i do now that you turn the panniers toward the window that you must admit is a very important aesthetic consideration h of course it essentially a sunshiny dress said edie smiling t meant to be worn out of doors on a fine afternoon when the light is falling slantwise you know just as it does now through the low window that the light painters always choose for doing satin in t certainly very pretty harry went on musing ut i afraid le breton would say it was a serious piece of economic hubris iece of what asked edie quickly iece of hubris n economical outrage don you see a gross antiocial and individualist demonstration hubris you know is greek for insolence at least not quite insolence but a sort of pride and overweening rebelliousness against the gods the kind of arrogance that brings nemesis after it you understand it was hubris in agamemnon and xerxes to go swelling about and ruffling themselves like turkeyocks because they were great conquerors and all that sort of thing and it was their nemesis to get murdered by clytemnestra or jolly well beaten by the athenians at salamis well le breton always uses the word for anything that he thinks socially wrong nd he thinks a good many things socially wrong i can tell you nything that partakes of the nature of a class distinction or a mere vulgar ostentation of wealth or a useless waste of good serviceable labourotten material he would call it hubris to have silver spoons when electroplate would do just as well or to keep a valet for your own personal attendant making one man into the mere bodily appanage of another or to buy anything you didn really need causing somebody else to do work for you which might otherwise have been avoided hich mr le breton he elder or the younger one h the younger rnest as for herbert the fellow of st aldate he not troubled with any such scruples he takes the world as he finds it heye both gone in for their degrees haven they es herbert has got a fellowship ernest up in residence still looking about for one t ernest that would think my dress a piece of whatouayallt es ernest hen i sure i shan like him i should insist upon every woman natural right to wear the dress or hat or bonnet that suits her complexion best ou can tell edie till youe met him he a very good fellow and of one thing i certain whatever he thinks right he does and sticks to it ut do you think harry i oughtn to wear a new peacocklue camelair dress on my first visit up to oxford ell edie dear i don quite know what my own opinions are exactly upon that matter i not an economist you see i a man of science when i look at you standing there so pretty in that pretty dress i feel inclined to say to myself every woman ought to do her best to make herself look as beautiful as she can for the common delectation of all humanity your beauty a greek would have said is a gift from the gods to us all and we ought all gratefully to make the most of it i sure i do hank you harry again youe in your politest humour this afternoon ut then on the other hand i know if le breton were here he soon argue me over to the other side he has the enthusiasm of humanity so strong upon him that you can help agreeing with him as long as he talking to you hen if he were here you probably make me put away the peacocklue for fear of hubris and nemesis and so forth and go up to oxford a perfect fright in my shabby old indian tussore don know that i should do that even then edie in the first place nothing on earth could make you look a perfect fright or anything like one popsy dear and in the second place i don know that i socialist enough myself ever to have the courage of my opinions as le breton has certainly i should never attempt to force them unwillingly upon others you must remember edie it one thing for le breton to be so communistic as all that comes to and quite another thing for you and me le breton father was a general and a knight you see and people will never forget that his mother lady le breton still whatever he does he may do what he likes in the way of social eccentricities and the world will only say he such a very strange advanced young fellow but if i were to take you up to oxford badly dressed or out of the fashion or looking peculiar in any way the world wouldn put it down to our political beliefs but would say we were mere country tradespeople by birth and didn know any better that makes a lot of difference you know oue quite right harry and yet do you know i think there must be something too in sticking to one own opinions like mr le breton i should stick to mine i sure and wear whatever dress i liked in spite of anybody it a sweet thing really isn it and she turned herself round craning over her shoulder to look at the effect in a vain attempt to assume an objective attitude towards her own back glad i going to oxford at last harry she said after a short pause have so longed to go all these years while you were an undergraduate and i dying to have got there now the chance has really come at last after all i shall glory in the place i certain and itl be so nice to make the acquaintance of all your clever friends ell edie said her brother smiling gently at the light joyous tremulous little figure think ie done right in putting it off till now it just as well you haven gone up to oxford till after your trip on the continent with me that three months in paris and switzerland and venice and florence did you a lot of good you see improved you and gave you tone and supplied you with things to talk about hy you oughtn to think i needed any improvement at all sir edie answered pouting nd as to talking i not aware i had ever any dearth of subjects for conversation even before i went on the continent there are things enough to be said about heaven and earth in england surely without one having to hurry through france and italy like cook excursionists just to hunt up something fresh to chatter about it my belief that a person who can find anything new to say about the everyay world around her won discover much suggestive matter for conversation in a continental bradshaw it like that feeble watery lady i met at the table dote at geneva from something she said i gathered she been in india and i asked her how she liked it oh she said it very hot i told her i had heard so before presently she said something casually about having been in brazil i asked her what sort of place brazil was oh she said it dreadfully hot i told her i heard that too byndy she began to talk again about barbadoes what did you think of the west indies i said oh said she theye terribly hot really i told her i had gathered as much from previous travellers and that was positively all in the end i ever got out of her for all her travels y dear edie ie always admitted that you were simply perfect harry said glancing at her with visible admiration nd i don think anything on earth could possibly improve you xcept perhaps a judicious course of differential and integral calculus which might possibly serve to tone down slightly your exuberant and excessive vitality still you know from the point of view of society which is a force we have always to reckon with constant in fact that we may call pi here can be no doubt in the world that to have been on the continent is a differentiating factor in one social position it doesn matter in the least what your own private evaluation of pi may be if you don happen to know the particular things and places that pi knows pi evaluation of you will be approximately a minimum of that you may be certain ell for my part i don care twopence about pi as you call it said edie tossing her pretty little head contemptuously ut i very glad indeed to have been on the continent for my own sake because of the pictures and palaces and mountains and waterfalls wee seen and not because of pi opinion of me for having seen them i would have been the same person really whether i seen them or not but i so much the richer myself for that view from the top of the col de balme and for that murillo h do you remember the flood of light on that murillo n the far corner of that delicious gallery at bologna why mother darling what on earth has been vexing you othing at all edie dear leastways that is nothing to speak of said her mother coming up from the shop hot and flurried from her desperate encounter with the redoubtable miss luttrell h i know just what it is darling cried the girl putting her arm around her mother waist caressingly and drawing her down to kiss her face half a dozen times over in her outburst of sympathy hat horrid old miss catherine has been here again i sure for i saw her going out of the shop just now and she been saying something or other spiteful as she always does to vex my dearie what did she say to you toay now do tell us duckie mother ell there said mrs oswald half laughing and half crying can tell e exactly what she did say but it was just the kind of thing that she mostly does impudent like just to hurt a body feelings she said you better not go to oxford edie but stop at home and learn your catechism ou might have pointed out to her mother dear said the young man smoothing her hair softly with his hand and kissing her forehead hat in the most advanced intellectual centres the church catechism is perhaps no longer regarded as the absolute ultimatum of the highest and deepest economical wisdom less your heart harry what be the good of talking that way to the likes of she she wouldn understand a single word of what you were driving at it must be all plain sailing with her without it in the way of spite and then she sees her chance to tack round the hardest corner with half a wind in her sails only as soon as look at it her sharpness goes all off toward illature that it do why she said you got on at oxford by good patronage here you see edie cried harry demonstratively hat an infinitesimal fraction of pi that a minute decimal of this great sneering ugly aggregate society that we have to deal with whether we will or no and that rends us and grinds us to powder if only it can once get in the thin end of a chance take shaky bitter old miss catherine for your unit multiply her to the nth and there you see the irreducible power we have to fight against all one political economy is very well in its way but the practical master of the situation is pi sitting autocratically in manyeaded judgment on our poor solitary little individualities and crushing us irretrievably with the dead weight of its inexorable cumulative nothingness and to think that that quivering old mass of perambulating jealousy hat living incarnation of envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness hould be able to make you uncomfortable for a single moment mother darling with her petty dribbling doddering venom why it simply unendurable here now harry said mrs oswald relenting ou mustn be too hard neither on poor old miss catherine she a bit soured you see by disappointments and one thing and another she doesn mean it really but it just her nature folks can be blamed for their nature now can they t occurs to me said harry quietly hat vipers only sting because it their nature and dr watts has made a similar observation with regard to the growling and fighting of bears and lions but i not aware that anybody has yet proposed to get up a society for the protection of those muchisunderstood creatures on the ground that they are not really responsible for their own inherited dispositions mr william sikes had a nature no doubt congenita which impelled him to beat his wife not sure that she was even his wife at all now i come to think of it but that a mere detail nd to kick his familiar acquaintances casually about the head we on the other hand have natures which impel us when we catch mr william sikes indulging in these innate idiosyncrasies by way of recreation to clap him promptly into prison and even under certain aggravating conditions to cause him to be hanged by the neck till he be dead this may be a regrettable incident of our own peculiar dispositions mother dear but it has at least the same justification as mr sikes or the bears and lions that is our nature to and i feel pretty much the same way about old miss luttrell ell there said his mother kissing him gently oue a bad rebellious boy to be calling names like a chatterag and i won listen to you any longer how pretty edie do look in her new dress to be sure harry il warrt there won be a prettier girl in oxford next week than what she is no nor a better one and a sweeter one neither harry put his arms round both their waists at once with an affectionate pressure and they went down to their oldashioned tea together in the little parlour behind the shop looking out over the garden and the beach and the great cliffs beyond on either hand to the very farthest edge of the distant clearut blue horizon chapter magdalen quad the reverend arthur collingham berkeley curate of st fredegond lounged lazily in his own neatly padded wickerwork easyhair opposite the large latticeaned windows of his pretty little firstloor rooms in the front quad of magdalen here a great deal to be said le breton in favour of october term he observed in his soft musical voice as he gazed pensively across the central grasslot to the crimson drapery of the founder tower ust look at that magnificent virginia creeper over there now just look at the way the red on it melts imperceptibly into tyrian purple and cloth of gold isn that in itself argument enough to fling at hartmann head if he ventured to come here sprinkling about his heresies with his affected little sprayhooter in the midst of a drowsy oxford autumn the cardinal never saw virginia creeper i suppose a man of his taste wouldn have been guilty of committing such a gross practical anachronism as that any more than he would have smoked a cigarette before tobacco was invented but if only he could have seen the october effect on that tower yonder he have acknowledged that his own hat and robe were positively nowhere in the running for colour wouldn he ell answered herbert putting down the venetian glass goblet he had been examining closely with due care into its niche in the overantel e no doubt wolsey had too much historical sense ever to step entirely out of his own century like my brother ernest for instance but ie never heard his opinion on the subject of colourarmonies and i should suspect it of having been distinctly tinged with nascent symptoms of renaissance vulgarity this is a lovely bit of venetian really berkeley how the dickens do you manage to pick up all these pretty things i wonder why can i afford them now hat a question for the endowed and established to put to a poor starving devil of a curate like me said berkeley lightly ou an incarnate sinecure and vested interest a creature revelling in an unearned income of fabulous oriental magnificence dare say putting one thing with another fully as much as five hundred a year o ask me the unbeneficed and insignificant with my wretched pittance of eighty pounds per annum and my three passen a term for classical mods how i scrape together the few miserable hoarded haence which i grudgingly invest in my pots and pipkins i save them from my dinner mr bursar save them if the church only recognised modest merit as it ought to do f the bishops only listened with due attention to the sound and scholarly exegesis of my sunday evening discourses at st fredegond hen indeed i might be disposed to regard things through a more satisfied medium he medium of a nice fat juicy country living but for you le breton ou sir a pluralist and a sanguisorb of the deepest dye o reproach me with my franciscan poverty h it too cruel an abuse i know herbert answered smiling and waving his hand gracefully at once admit it abuses exist unhappily and while they continue do so isn it better they should envisage themselves as me than as some other and probably less deserving fellow o it not decidedly i should much prefer that one of them envisaged itself as me h of course from your own strictly subjective point of view that very natural i also look at the question abstractly from the side of the empirical ego and correctly deduce a corresponding conclusion only then you see the terms of the minor premiss are luckily reversed ell my dear fellow said the curate he fact about the teahings is this you eat up your income devour your substance in riotous living i prefer to feast my eyes and ears to my grosser senses you dine at high table and fare sumptuously every day i take a commons of cold beef for lunch and have tea off an egg and roll in my own rooms at seven you drink st emilion or still hock i drink water from the well or the cup that cheers but not obfuscates the difference goes to pay for the crockery do likewise and with your untold wealth you might play aunt sally at oriental blue and take cockhots with a bootack at hawthornattern vases t any rate berkeley you always manage to get your money worth of amusement out of your money f course because i lay myself out to do it buy a bottle of champagne drink it off and there you have to show for your total permanent investment on the transaction the memory of a noisy evening and a headache the next morning buy a flute or a book of poems or a little picture or a palissy platter and you have something to turn to with delight and admiration for half a lifetime h but it isn everybody who can isolate himself so utterly from the workaday world and live so completely in his own little paradise of art as you can my dear fellow non omnia possumus omnes you seem to be always up in the aesthetic clouds with your own music automatically laid on and no need of cherubim or seraphim to chant continually for your gratification play me something of your own on your flute now like a good fellow o i won because the spirit doesn move me it treachery to the divine gift to play when you don want to besides what the use of playing before you when youe not the dean of a musical cathedral david was wiser he played only before saul who had of course all the livings in his own gift no doubt ie got a new thing running in my head this very minute that you shall hear though all the same as soon as ie hammered it into shape sort of villanette in music a little whiff of country freshness suggested by the new ethereal acquisition little miss butterfly have you seen miss butterfly yet ot by that name at any rate who is she h the name my own invention mademoiselle volauvent i mean he little bit of whirligig thistledown from devonshire oswald sister you know of oriel h that one yes just caught a glimpse of her in the high on thursday very pretty certainly and as airy as a hummingird hat her she coming here to lunch this morning if youe a good boy and will promise not to say anything naughty you may stop and meet her she a nice little thing but rather timid at seeing so many fresh faces you mustn frighten her by discussing the absolute and the unconditioned or bore her by talking about aristotle politics or the revolutions in corcyra for you know my dear le breton if you have a fault it is that youe such a consummate and irrepressible prig now aren you really hardly a fair judge on that subject i suppose berkeley but if you have a rudimentary glimmering of a virtue it is that youe such a deliciously frank and yet considerate critic il pocket your rudeness though and eat your lunch in spite of it is miss butterfly as you call her as standff as her brother ot at all she accueillante to the last degree ery restricted i suppose country girl of the first water horizon absolutely bounded by the high hedges of her native parish h dear no anything but that she like her brother naturally quick and adaptive swald an excellent fellow in his way said herbert buttonoling his own waistcoat ut he spoilt by two bad traits in the first place he so dreadfully conscious of the fact that he has risen from a lower position and then again he so engrossingly and pervadingly mathematical square seems to have seized upon him bodily and to have wormed its fatal way into his very marrow h you must remember he true to his first love culture came to him first while yet he abode in philistia under the playful disguise of a conic section he scaled his way out of gath by means of a treatise on elementary trigonometry and evaded askelon on the wings of an undulatory theory of light it is different with us you know who have emerged from the land of darkness by the regular classical and literary highway we feed upon rabelais and burton he flits carelessly from flower to flower of the theory of quantics if he were an idealist painter like rossetti he would paint great allegorical pictures for us representing an asymptotic curve appearing to him in a dream and introducing that blushing maiden hyperbola to his affectionate consideration as berkeley spoke a rap sounded on the oak and ernest le breton entered the room hat you here herbert he said with a shade of displeasure in his tone re you too of the bidden erkeley has asked me to stop and lunch with him if that what you mean e shall be quite a party said ernest seating himself and looking abstractedly round the room hy berkeley as his eye fell upon the venetian vase oue positively got some more gewaws here this one new isn it eh es i picked it up for a song this long at a stranded village in the apennines literally for a song for it cost me just what i got from fradelli for that last little piece of mine it very pretty isn it ery exquisite really the blending of the tones is so perfect i wish i knew what to think about these things i can make up my mind about them sometimes i think it all right to make them and buy them sometimes i think it all wrong h if that your difficulty said berkeley pulling his white tie straight at the tiny round lookinglass can easily reassure you do you think a hundred and eighty pounds a year an excessive sum for one person to spend upon his own entire living t doesn seem so as expenses go amongst us said ernest seriously hough i dare say it would look like shocking extravagance to a working man with a wife and family ery well that the very outside i ever spend upon myself in any one year for the excellent reason that it all i ever get to spend in any way now why shouldn i spend it on the things that please me best and are joys for ever instead of on the things that disappear at once and perish in the using h but that not the whole question ernest answered looking at the curate fixedly hat right have you and i to spend so much when others are wanting for bread and what right have you or i to make other people work at producing these useless trinkets for our sole selfish gratification ell now le breton said the parson assuming a more serious tone ou know youe a reasonable creature so i don mind discussing this question with you youe got an ethical foundation to your nature and you want to see things done on decent grounds of distributive justice there i am one with you but youe also got an aesthetic side to your nature which makes you worth arguing with upon the matter i won argue with your vulgar materialised socialist who would break up the frieze of the parthenon for road metal or pull down giotto frescoes because they represent scenes in the fabulous lives of saints and martyrs you know what a work of art is when you see it and therefore youe worth arguing with which your vulgar continental socialist really isn the one cogent argument for him is the whiff of grapehot recognise said ernest hat the works of art of poetry or of music which we possess are a grand inheritance from the past and i would do all i could to preserve them intact for those that come after us sure you would no restoration or tinkering in you i certain well then would you give anything for a world which hadn got this aesthetic side to its corporate existence would you give anything for a world which didn care at all for painting sculpture music poetry i wouldn i don want such a world i won countenance such a world il do nothing to further or advance such a world it utterly repugnant to me and i banish it as themistocles banished the athenians ut consider said ernest e live in a world where men and women are actually starving how can we reconcile to our consciences the spending of one penny on one useless thing when others are dying of sheer want and cold and nakedness that the great question that always oppressing my poor dissatisfied conscience o it does everybody xcept herbert he explains it all on biological grounds as the beautiful discriminative action of natural selection simple but not consolatory still look at the other side of the question suppose you and everybody else were to give up all superfluities and confine all your energies to the unlimited production of bare necessaries suppose you occupy every acre of land with your cornields or your piggeries and sweep away all the parks and woods and heaths and moorlands in england suppose you keep on letting your population multiply as fast as it chooses nd it will multiply you know in that ugly reckless antialthusian fashion of its own ill every rood of ground maintains its man and only just maintains him and what will you have got then dead level of abject pauperism put in herbert blandly reductio ad absurdum of all your visionary schurzian philosophy my dear ernest look at it another way now and just consider which really and truly matters most to you and me a great work of art or a highly respectable hornyanded son of toil whose acquaintance we have never had the pleasure of personally making suppose you read in the times that the respectable hornyanded one has fallen off a scaffolding and broken his neck and that the dresden madonna has been burnt by an unexpected accident which of the two items of intelligence affects you the most acutely my dear fellow you may push your humanitarian enthusiasm as far as ever you like but in your heart of hearts you know as well as i do that youl deeply regret the loss of the madonna and youl never think again about the fate of the respectable hornyanded his wife or children ernest answer if he had any to make was effectually nipped in the bud by the entrance of the scout who came in to announce mr and miss oswald and mrs martindale edie wore the grey dress her brother present and flitted into the room after her joyous fashion full of her first fresh delight at the cloistered quad of magdalen hat a delicious college mr berkeley she said holding out her hand to him brightly mr le breton this is your brother i know by the likeness i thought new college very beautiful but nothing ie seen is quite as beautiful as magdalen what a privilege to live always in such a place and what an exquisite view from your window here es said berkeley moving a few musicooks from the seat in the windowill ome and sit by it miss oswald mrs martindale won you put your shawl down how the professor toay so sorry he couldn come h he had to go to sit on one of his boards said the old lady seating herself ut you know i quite accustomed to going out without him arthur berkeley knew as much indeed being a person of minute strategical intellect he had purposely looked out a day on which the professor had to attend a meeting of the delegates of something or other so as to secure mrs martindale services without the supplementary drawback of that prodigious bore not that he was particularly anxious for mrs martindale own society which was of the most strictly negative character but he didn wish edie to be the one lady in a party of four men and he invited the professor wife as an excellent neutral figureead to keep her in countenance ladies were scarcer then in oxford than they are nowadays the married fellow was still a tentative problematical experiment in those years and the invasion of the parks by young couples had hardly yet begun in earnest so female society was still at a considerable local premium and berkeley was glad enough to secure even colourless old mrs martindale to square his party at any price nd how do you like oxford miss oswald asked ernest making his way towards the window y dear le breton what a question to put to her said berkeley smiling s if oxford were a place to be appraised offhand on three days acquaintance you remind me of the american who went to look at niagara and made an approving note in his memorandum book to say that he found it really a very elegant cataract h but you must form some opinion of it at least at first sight cried edie ou can help having an impression of a place from the first moment even if you haven a judgment on it can you now i think it really surpasses my expectations mr le breton which is always a pleasant surprise venice fell below them florence just came up to them but oxford i think really surpasses them e have three beautiful towns in britain berkeley said s if he were a welsh triad suggested herbert le breton parenthetically orquay oxford edinburgh torquay is all nature spoilt by what i won call art oxford is all art superimposed on a swamp that i won call nature edinburgh is both nature and art working pretty harmoniously together to make up a unique and exquisite picture ust like naples venice and heidelberg said edie half to herself but berkeley caught at the words quickly as she said them es he answered very good parallel only oxford has a trifle more nature about it than venice the lagoon without the palaces would be simply hideous the oseney flats without the colleges would be nothing worse than merely dull e owe a great deal said ernest gazing out towards the quadrangle o the forgotten mass of labouring humanity who piled all those blocks of shapeless stone into beautiful forms for us who come after to admire and worship i often wonder when i sit here in berkeley windoweat and look across the quad to the carved pinnacles on the founder tower there whether any of us can ever hope to leave behind to our successors any legacy at all comparable to the one left us by those nameless old mediaeval masons it a very saddening thought that we for whom all these beautiful things have been put together e whom labouring humanity has pampered and petted from our cradles upward feeding us on its whitest bread and toiling for us with all its weary sinews hat we probably will never do anything at all for it and for the world in return but will simply eat our way through life aimlessly and die forgotten in the end like the beasts that perish it ought to make us as a class terribly ashamed of our own utter and abject inutility edie looked at him with a sort of hushed surprise she was accustomed to hear harry talk radical talk enough after his own fashion but radicalism of this particular pensive tinge she was not accustomed to it interested her and made her wonder what sort of man mr le breton might really be ell you know mr le breton said old mrs martindale complacently e must remember that providence has wisely ordained that we shouldn all of us be masons or carpenters some of us are clergymen now and look what a useful valuable life a clergyman is after all isn it mr berkeley berkeley smiled a faint smile of amusement but said nothing thers are squires and landed gentry and i sure the landed gentry are very desirable in keeping up the tone of the country districts and setting a pattern of virtue and refinement to their poorer neighbours what would the country villages be for example if it weren for the centres of culture afforded by the rectory and the hall eh miss oswald edith thought of quavering old miss catherine luttrell gossiping with the rector wife and held her peace ou may depend upon it providence has ordained these distinctions of classes for its own wise purposes and we needn trouble our heads at all about trying to alter them e always observed said harry oswald hat providence is supposed to have ordained the existing order for the time being whatever it may be but not the order that is at that exact moment endeavouring to supplant it if i were to visit central africa i should confidently expect to be told by the rainoctors that providence had ordained the absolute power of the chief and the custom of massacring his wives and slaves at his open grave side i believe in russia it usually allowed that providence has placed the orthodox czar at the head of the nation and that any attempt to obtain a constitution from him is simply flat rebellion and flying in the face of providence in england we had a king john once and we extracted a constitution out of him and sundry other kings by main force and here it acquiescence in the present limited aristocratic government that makes up obedience to the providential arrangement of things apparently but how about america eh mrs martindale did providence ordain that george washington was to rebel against his most sacred majesty king george or did it not and did it ordain that george washington was to knock his most sacred majesty troops into a cocked hat or did it not and did it ordain that abraham lincoln was to free the slaves or did it not what i want to know is this can it be said that providence has ordained every class distinction in the whole world from dahomey to san francisco and has it ordained every government past and present from the chinese empire to the french convention did it ordain for example the revolution of that the question i should like to have answered ear me mr oswald said the old lady meekly taken aback by harry voluble vehemence suppose providence permits some things and ordains others nd does it permit american democracy or ordain it asked the merciless harry on you see mrs martindale put in berkeley coming gently to her rescue our principle amounts in effect to saying that whatever is is right xactly said the old lady forgetting at once all about dahomey or the convention and coming back mentally to her squires and rectors he existing order is wisely arranged by providence and we mustn try to set ourselves up against it ut if whatever is is right edie said laughing hen mr le breton socialism must be right too you see because it exists in him no doubt for some wise purpose of providence and if he and those who think with him can succeed in changing things generally according to their own pattern then the new system that they introduce will be the one that providence has shown by the result to be the favoured one n short said ernest musingly rs martindale principle sanctifies success it the old theory of treason never prospers hat the reason because whener it prospers is not treason if we could only introduce a socialist republic then it would be the reactionaries who would be setting themselves up against constituted authority and so flying in the face of providence ancy lecturing a recalcitrant archbishop and a remonstrant cievant duchess cried berkeley lightly pon the moral guilt and religious sinfulness of rebellion against the constituted authority of a communist phalanstery it would be simply charming i can imagine myself composing a dignified exhortation to deliver to his grace entirely compiled out of his own printed pastorals on the duty of submission and the danger of harbouring an insubordinate spirit do make me chaplainnrdinary to your house of correction for irreclaimable aristocrats le breton as soon as you once get your coming socialist republic fairly under way uncheon is on the table sir said the scout breaking in unceremoniously upon their discussion if arthur berkeley lunched by himself upon a solitary commons of cold beef he certainly did not treat his friends and guests in corresponding fashion his little entertainment was of the daintiest and airiest character so airy that as edie herself observed afterwards to harry it took away all the sense of meat and drink altogether and left one only a pleased consciousness of full artistic gratification even ernest though he had his scruples about the aspic jelly might eat the famous magdalen chicken cutlets his brother said ith a distinct feeling of exalted gratitude to the arduous culinary evolution of collective humanity onsider said herbert balancing neatly a little pyramid of whip cream and apricot jam upon his fork onsider what ages of slow endeavour must have gone to the development of such a complex mixture as this ernest and thank your stars that you were born in this nineteenth century of soyer and francatelli instead of being condemned to devour a homeric feast with the unsophisticated aid of your own five fingers ut do tell me mr le breton asked edie with one of her pretty smiles hat will this socialist republic of yours be like when it actually comes about i dying to know all about it eally miss oswald ernest answered in a halfmbarrassed tone don quite know how to reply to such a very wide and indefinite question i haven got any cutndried constitutional scheme of my own for reorganising the whole system of society any distinct panacea to cure all the ills that collective flesh is heir to i leave the details of the future order to your brother harry the thing that troubles me is not so much how to reform the world at large as how to shape one own individual course aright in the actual midst of it as a single unit of the whole i want rather guidance for my private conduct than a scheme for redressing the universal dislocation of things in general it seems to me every man first duty is to see that he himself is in the right attitude towards society and afterwards he may proceed to enquire whether society is in the right attitude towards him and all its other members but if we were all to begin by redressing ourselves there would be nothing left to redress i imagine when we turned to attack the second half of our problem the great difficulty i myself experience is this that i can discover any adequate social justification for my own personal existence but i really oughtn to bore other people with my private embarrassments upon that head ou see said herbert le breton carelessly y brother represents the ethical element in the socialist movement miss oswald while harry represents the political element each is valuable in its way but oswald is the more practical you can move great masses into demanding their rights you can so easily move them into cordially recognising their duties hammer hammer hammer at the most obvious abuses that the way all the political victories are finally won if i were a radical at all i should go with you oswald but happily i not one i prefer the calm philosophic attitude of perfectly objective neutrality nd if i were a radical said berkeley with a tinge of sadness in his voice as he poured himself out a glass of hock should go with le breton but unfortunately i not one miss oswald i only a parson chapter a little music after lunch herbert le breton went off for his afternoon ride grave social misdemeanour ernest thought it nd arthur berkeley took edie round to show her about the college and the shady gardens ernest would have liked to walk with her himself for there was something in her that began to interest him somewhat and besides she was so pretty and so graceful and so sympathetic but he felt he must not take her away from her host for the time being who had a sort of proprietary right in the pleasing duty of acting as showman to her over his own college so he dropped behind with harry oswald and old mrs martindale and endeavoured to simulate a polite interest in the old lady scraps of conversation upon the heads of houses their wives and families his is addison walk miss oswald said berkeley taking her through the gate into the wooded path beside the cherwell o called because the ingenious mr addison is said to have specially patronised it as he was an undergraduate of this college and a singularly lazy person it very probable that he really did so every other undergraduate certainly does for it the nearest walk an idle man can get without ever taking the trouble to go outside the grounds of magdalen he ingenious mr addison was quite right then edie answered smiling or he couldn have chosen a lovelier place on earth to stroll in how exquisite it looks just now with the mellow light falling down upon the path through this beautiful autumnal foliage it just a natural cathedral aisle with a lot of pale strawoloured glass in the painted windows like that splendid one we went to see the other day at merton chapel es there are certainly tones in that window i never saw in any other berkeley said nd the walk toay is very much the same in its delicate colouring youe fond of colour i should think miss oswald from what you say h nobody could help being struck by the autumn colouring of the thames valley i should fancy said edie blushing e noticed it all the way up as we came in the train from reading a perfect glow of crimson and orange at pangbourne goring mapledurham and nuneham i always thought the dart in october the loveliest blaze of warm reds and yellows i had ever seen anywhere in nature but the thames valley beats it hollow as harry says this walk toay is just one ideal picture of milton vallombrosa h yes i always look forward to the first days of october term said berkeley slowly s one of the greatest and purest treats in the whole round workaday twelvemonth when the creeper on the founder tower first begins to redden and crimson in the autumn i could sit all day long by my open window and just look at that glorious sight alone instead of having my dinner but i very fond of these walks in full summer time too i often stop up alone all through the long being tied to my curacy here permanently you kno and then i have the run of the place entirely to myself sometimes i take my flute out and sit under the shade here and compose some of my little pieces can easily understand that they were composed here said edie quickly heye caught exactly the flavour of the place specially your exquisite little penseroso h you know my music then miss oswald h yes harry always brings me home all your pieces whenever he comes back at the end of term i can play every one of them without the notes but the penseroso is my special favourite t mine too i so glad you like it but i working away at a little thing now which you shall hear as soon as ie finished it something lighter and daintier than anything else ie ever attempted i shall call it the butterfly canzonet hy don you publish your music under your own name mr berkeley h because it would never do i a parson now and i must keep up the dignity of the cloth by fighting shy of any aesthetic heterodoxies it would be professional suicide for me to be suspected of artistic leanings all very well in an archdeacon you know to cultivate his tastes for chants and anthems but for a simple curate nd secular songs too hy it would be sheer contumacy his chances of a living would shrink at once to what your brother would call a vanishing quantity ell you can imagine how much i admire your songs and airs mr berkeley i was so pleased when you invited us to think i was going to lunch with a real composer there no music i love so much as yours very glad to hear it miss oswald i assure you but i only a beginner and a trifler yet some day i mean to produce something that will be worth listening to only do you remember what some french novelist once said a poet sweetest poem is always the one he has never been able to compose i often think that true of music too away up in the higher stories of one brain somewhere there a tune floating about or rather a whole oratorio full of them that one can never catch and fix upon ruled paper the idea there such a beautiful and vague idea so familiar to one but so utterly unrealisable on any known instrument sort of musical ariel flitting before one and tantalising one for ever but never allowing one to come up with it and see its real features i always dissatisfied with what ie actually written and longing to crystallise into a score the imaginary airs i can never catch except in this last piece of mine that the only thing ie ever done that thoroughly and completely pleases me come and see me next week and il play it over to you they walked all round the meadows and back again beside the arches of the beautiful bridge and then returned to berkeley rooms once more for a cup of afternoon tea and an air or two of berkeley own composing edie enjoyed the walk and the talk immensely she enjoyed the music even more in a way it was all so new to her for though she had always seen much of harry and though harry who was the kindest and proudest of brothers had always instinctively kept her up to his own level of thought and conversation still she wasn used to seeing so many intelligent and educated young men together and the novelty of their society was delightfully exhilarating to her eager little mind to a bright girl of nineteen wherever she may come from the atmosphere of oxford has a wonderfully cheering and stimulating effect to a country tradesman daughter from a tiny westountry village it is like a little paradise on earth with a ceaseless round of intensely enjoyable breakfasts luncheons dinners and waterarties ernest for his part was not so well pleased he wanted to have a little conversation with oswald sister and he was compelled by politeness to give her up in favour of arthur berkeley however he made up for it when he returned and monopolised the pretty little visitor himself for almost the entire teaour as soon as they had gone arthur berkeley sported his oak and sat down by himself in his comfortable crimsonovered basket chair won let anybody come and disturb me this evening he said to himself moodily won let any of these noisy magdalen men come with their racket and riot to cut off the memory of that bright little dream no desecration after she has gone little miss butterfly what a pretty airy dainty delicate little morsel it is how she flits and sips and natters about every possible subject just touching the tip of it so gracefully with her tiny white fingers and blushing so unfeignedly when she thinks she paid you a compliment or youe paid her one how she blushed when she said she liked my music how she blushed when i said she had a splendid ear for minute discrimination somehow if i were a fallingnove sort of fellow i half fancy i could manage to fall in love with her on the spot or rather if i were a good analytical psychologist perhaps i ought more correctly to say i am in love with her already he sat down idly at the piano and played a few bars softly to himself beautiful airy sort of melody as it shaped itself vaguely in his head at the moment with a little of the new wine of first love running like a trill through the midst of its fastlowing quavers and dainty undulations hat will do he said to himself approvingly hat will do very well that little miss butterfly here she flits flits flits flickers sip sip sip at her honeyed flowers twirl away whirl away off in the sunshine here you go miss butterfly eddying and circling with your painted mate flirt flirt flirt coquetting and curvetting in your pretty rhythmical a rial quadrille down again down to the hareell on the hill side sip at it sip at it sip at it sweet little honeyrops clear little honeyrops bright little honeyrops oh for a song to be set to the melody traaa trooo up again butterfly little silk handkerchief little lace neckerchief fluttering fluttering feathery wings of her bright little eyes of her flit flit flicker now she blushes blushes blushes deep crimson oh what a colour paint it painter now she speaks oh what laughter silvery silvery treble treble treble trill away trill away silvery treble musical beautiful beautiful musical little miss butterfly ly ly ly away and he brought his fingers down upon the gamut at last with a hasty flickering touch that seemed really as delicate as edie own can never get words for it in english he said again half speaking with his parted lips t too dactylic in rhythm for english verse to go to it b ranger might have written a lilt for it as far as mere syllables go but b ranger to write about miss butterfly ho no frenchman could possibly catch it swinburne could fit the metres i dare say but he couldn fit the feeling it shall be a song without words unless i write some italian lines for it myself animula blandula vagula hat the sort of ring for it but latin mostly too heavy io hymen hymenae io io hymen hymenae what that a wedding song of catullus bsit omen i must be in love with her indeed he got up from the piano and paced quickly and feverishly up and down the room nd yet he went on f only i weren bound down so by this unprofitable trade of parson a curate on eighty pounds a year and a few pupils the presumptuousness of the man in venturing to think of falling in love as if he were actually one of the beneficed clergy what are deacons coming to i wonder and yet hath not a deacon eyes hath not a deacon hands organs dimensions senses affections passions if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh and if you show us a little miss butterfly beautiful to the fingernds do we not fall in love with her at least as unaffectedly as if we were canons residentiary or rural deans fancy little miss butterfly a rural deaness the notion too ridiculous fly away little miss butterfly fly away sweet little frolicsome laughsome creature i won try to tie you down to a man in a black clerical coat with a very distant hypothetical reversionary prospect of a dull and dingy country parsonage flit elsewhere little miss butterfly flit elsewhere and find yourself a gayer gaudieroloured mate he sat down again and strummed a few more bars of his halfomposed halfxtemporised melody then he leant back on the musictool and said gently to himself once more till if it were possible how happy i should try to make her bright little miss butterfly i would try never to let a cold cloud pass chillily over your sunshiny head i would live for you and work for you and write songs for your sake all full of you you you and so all full of life and grace and thrilling music what my life good for to me or to the world a clergyman life is such a useful one that amiable old conventionality gurgled out this morning what the good of mine as it stands now to its owner or to anybody else i should like to know except the dear old progenitor a mere bit of cracked blue china a fanciful air from a comic opera masquerading in black and white as a piece of sacred music what good am i to anyone on earth but the progenitor god bless him and when he gone dear old fellow what on earth shall i have left to live for a selfish blank that all but with her ah how different with her to live for and to cherish with an object to set before oneself as worth one consideration what mightn i do at last make her happy fter all that the great thing make her fond of my music that music that floats and evades me now but would harden into scores as if by magic with her to help one to spell it out know it would at last i know it would ah well perhaps some day i may be able perhaps some day the dream will realise itself till then work work work let me try to work towards making it possible a living or a livelihood no matter which but not a breath of it to you meanwhile miss butterfly flit about freely and joyously while you may i would not spoil your untrammelled flight for worlds by trying to tether it too soon around the fixed centre of my own poor doubtful diaconal destinies at the same moment while arthur berkeley was thus garrulously conversing with his heated fancy harry and edie oswald were strolling lazily down the high to edie lodgings ell what do you think now of berkeley and le breton edie asked her brother hich of them do you like the best like them both immensely harry i really can choose between them when mr berkeley plays he almost makes me fall in love with him and when mr le breton talks he almost makes me transfer my affections to him instead but mr berkeley plays divinely and mr le breton talks beautifully you know ie never seen such clever men before xcept you of course harry dear for youe cleverer and nicer than anybody oh do let me look at those lovely silks over there and she danced across the road before he could answer her like a tripping sylph in a painter dreamland r le breton very nice she went on after she had duly examined and classified the silks ut i don exactly understand what it is he got on his conscience othing whatsoever except the fact of his own existence harry answered with a laugh e has conscientious scruples against the existence of idle people in the community and eatlls nd therefore he has conscientious scruples against himself for not immediately committing suicide i believe if he did exactly what he thought was abstractly right he go away and cut his own throat incontinently for an unprofitable unproductive useless citizen h dear i hope hel do nothing of the sort cried edie hastily think i shall really ask him not to for my sake if not for anybody else e be very much flattered indeed by your interposition on his behalf no doubt popsy but i afraid it wouldn produce much effect upon his ultimate decision ell me harry is mr berkeley high church h dear no i shouldn say so i don suppose he ever gave the subject a single moment consideration ut st fredegond is very high church i told h yes but berkeley curate of st fredegond not in virtue of his theology never heard he got any to speak of ut in virtue of his musical talents he went into the church i suppose on purely aesthetic grounds he liked a musical service and it seemed natural to him to take part in one just as it seemed natural to a mediaeval italian with artistic tendencies to paint madonnas and st sebastians there nothing more in his clerical coat than that i fancy edie he probably never thought twice about it on theological grounds h but that very wrong of him harry i don mean having no particular theological beliefs of course one expects that nowadays but going into the church without them ell you see edie you mustn judge berkeley in quite the same way as you judge other people in his mind the aesthetic side is always uppermost the logical side is comparatively in abeyance questions of creed questions of philosophical belief questions of science don interest him at all he looks at all of them from the point of view of the impression alone what he sees in the church is not a body of dogmas like the high churchmen nor a set of opinions like the low churchmen but a close corporation of educated and cultivated gentlemen charged with the duty of caring for a number of beautiful mediaeval architectural monuments and of carrying on a set of grand and impressive musical or oral services to him a cathedral is a magnificent historical heritage a sermon is a sort of ingenious literary exercise and a hymn is a capital vehicle for very solemn emotional music that all and we can hardly blame him for not seeing these things as we should see them ell harry i don know i like them both immensely mr berkeley very nice but perhaps i like mr le breton the best of the two chapter askelon villa gath number epsilon terrace bayswater was one of the very smallest houses that a person with any pretensions to move in that society which habitually spells itself with a capital initial could ever possibly have dreamt of condescending to inhabit indeed if dame eleanor relict of the late sir owen le breton knight had consulted merely the length of her purse and the interests of her personal comfort she would doubtless have found for the same rental a far more convenient and roomy cottage in upper clapton or stoke newington but lady le breton was a thoroughly and conscientiously religious woman who in all things consulted first and foremost the esoteric interests of her ingrained creed it was a prime article of this cherished social faith that nobody with any shadow of personal selfespect could endure to live under any other postal letter than w or s w better not to be at all than to drag out a miserable existence in the painful obscurity of n or s e happily for people situated like lady le breton the metropolitan houseontractor it would be gross flattery to describe him as a builde has divined with his usual practical sagacity the necessity for supplying this felt want for eligible family residences at once comparatively cheap and relatively fashionable by driving little culseac and rentrant alleys at the back of his larger rows of shoddy mansions he is enabled to run up a smaller terrace or crescent or place as the case may be composed of tiny shallow cottages with the narrowest possible frontage and the tallest possible elevation which will yet entitle their occupiers to feel themselves within the sacred pale of social salvation in the blest security of the mystic w narrowest shallowest and tallest of these marginal society residences is the little block of blankaced stuccoronted porticoed rabbitutches which blazons itself forth in the court guide under the imposing designation of epsilon terrace bayswater the interior of no in this eminently respectable back alley was quite of a piece it must be confessed with the vacant philistinism of its naked exterior other has really an immense amount of taste herbert le breton used to say blandly nd all of it of the most atrocious description she picked it up i believe when my poor father was quartered at lahore a station absolutely fatal to the aesthetic faculties and she will never get rid of it again as long as she lives indeed when once lady le breton got anything whatsoever into her head it was not easy for anybody else to get it out again you might much more readily expect to draw one of her double teeth than to eliminate one of her pet opinions not that she was a stupid or a nearighted woman he mother of clever sons never is ut she was a perfectly immovable rock of social and political orthodoxy the three le breton boys or there was a third at home ould gladly have reformed the terrors of that awful drawingoom if they had dared but they knew it was as much as their places were worth herbert said to attempt a remonstrance and they wisely left it alone and said nothing of course the house was not vulgarly furnished at least in the conventional sense of the word lady le breton was far too rigid in her social orthodoxy to have admitted into her rooms anything that savoured of what she considered bad form according to her lights it was only vulgar with the underlying vulgarity of mere tasteless fashionable uniformity there was nothing in it that any wellred footman could object to nothing that anybody with one grain of genuine originality could possibly tolerate the little occasional chairs and tables set casually about the room were of the strictest n glig belgravian type a sort of studied protest against the formal stiffness of the ordinary unused middlelass drawingoom the portrait of the late sir owen in the wee library presented by his brotherfficers was painted by that distinguished r a sir francis thomson a light of the middle of this century and an excellent work of art it was too in its own solemn academic kind the diningoom tiny as it was possessed that inevitable canaletti without which no gentleman diningoom in england is ever considered to be complete everything spoke at once the stereotyped society style of a dozen years ago before mr morris had reformed the outer aspect of the west en entirely free from anything so startling or indecorous as a gleam of spontaneity in the possessor mind to be sure it was very far indeed from the centre roundable and brilliantloweredableover style of the utter unregenerate philistine household but it was further still from the simple natural taste and graceful fancy of edie oswald cosy little back parlour behind the village grocer shop at calcombeomeroy the portrait and the canaletti were relics of lady le breton best days when sir owen was alive and the boys were still in their first babyhood sir owen was an indian officer of the old school a simpleinded gentle brave man very religious after his own fashion and an excellent soldier with the true anglondian faculty for administration and organisation it was partly from him no doubt that the boys inherited their marked intelligence and it was wholly from him beyond any doubt at all that ernest and his younger brother ronald inherited their moral or religious sincerity or that was an element in which poor formally orthodox lady le breton was wholly deficient the good general had been brought up in the strictest doctrines of the clapham sect he had gone to india young as a cadet from haileybury and he had applied his intellect all his life long rather to the arduous task of extending he blessings of british rule to sikhs and ghoorkas than to those abstract ethical or theological questions which agitated the souls of a later generation if a new district had to be assimilated in settlement to the established model of the british raj if a tribe of hillavages had to be conciliated by gentler means than rifles or bayonets if a difficult bit of diplomatic duty had to be performed on the debateable frontiers sir owen le breton was always the person chosen to undertake it an earnest honest godearing man he remained to the end impressed by a profound sense of duty as he understood it and a firm conviction that his true business in life consisted in serving his queen and country and in bringing more and more of the native populations within the pale of the company empire and the future evangelisation that was ultimately to follow but during the great upheaval of the mutiny he fell at the head of his own unrevolted regiment in one of the hottest battles of that terrible time and my lady le breton found herself left alone with three young children on little more than the scanty pension of a general officer widow on the late company establishment happily enough remained to bring up the boys with the aid of their terminable annuities which fell in on their attaining their majorit in decent respect for the feelings and demands of exacting society and as the two elder were decidedly clever boys they managed to get scholarships at oxford which enabled them to tide over the dangerous intermediate period as far as their degree herbert then stepped at once into a fellowship and sundry other good things of like sort and ernest was even now trying to follow in his brother steps in this particular only the youngest boy ronald still remained quite unprovided for ronald was a tall pale gentle weakly enthusiastic young fellow of nineteen with so marked a predisposition to lung disease that it had not been thought well to let him run the chance of overeading himself and so he had to be content with remaining at home in the uncongenial atmosphere of epsilon terrace instead of joining his two elder brothers at the university uncongenial because ronald alone followed sir owen in the religious half of his nature and found the orldliness and conventionality of his unflinching mother a serious bar to his enjoyment of home society onald said my lady at the breakfastable on the very morning of arthur berkeley little luncheon party ere a letter for you from mackenzie and anderson no doubt your aunt sarah will has been recovered and proved at last and i hope itl turn out satisfactory as we wish it or my part i really almost hope it won mother said ronald turning it over or i don want to be compelled to profit by ernest excessive generosity he too good to me just because he thinks me the weaker vessel but though we must bear one another burdens you know we should each bear his own cross as well shouldn we mother ell it can be much in any case said his mother a little testily hoever gets it open the envelope at once my boy and don stand looking at it like a goose in that abstracted way h mother she was my father only sister and i not in such a hurry to find out how she has disposed of her mere perishing worldly goods answered ronald gravely t seems to me a terrible thing that before poor dear good aunt sarah is cold in her grave almost we should be speculating and conjecturing as to what she has done with her poor little trifle of earthly riches t always usual to read the will immediately after the funeral said lady le breton firmly to whom the ordinary usage of society formed an absolutely unanswerable argument nd how you ronald who haven even the common decency to wear a bit of crape around your arm for her thing that ernest himself with all his nonsensical theories consents to do an talk in that absurd way about what quite right and proper to be done i for my part really can imagine h but you know mother i object to wearing crape on the ground that it isn allowable for us to sorrow as them that have no hope and i sure i paying no disrespect to dear aunt sarah memory in this matter for she was always the first herself you remember to wish that i should follow the dictates of my own conscience remember she always upheld you in acts of opposition to your own mother ronald lady le breton said coldly nd i suppose youe going to do honour to her religious precepts now by not opening that letter when your mother tells you to do so in my bible sir i find a place for the fourth commandment ronald looked at her gently and unreprovingly but though a quiet smile played involuntarily around the corners of his mouth he resisted the natural inclination to correct her mistake and to suggest blandly that she probably alluded to the fifth he knew he must turn his left cheek also christian virtue which he had abundant opportunities of practising in that household and he felt that to score off his mother for such a verbal mistake as the one she had just made would not be in keeping with the spirit of the commandment to which no doubt she meant to refer him so without another word he opened the envelope and glanced rapidly at the contents of the letter it enclosed heye found the second will he said after a moment with a rather husky voice nd theye taking steps to get it confirmed whatever that may be road scotch for getting probate i believe said lady le breton in a slight tone of irony for to her mind any departure from the laws or language she was herself accustomed to use assumed at once the guise of a rank and offensive provincialism our poor aunt would go and marry a scotchman and he a scotch business man too so of course we must expect to put up with all kinds of ridiculous technicalities and edinburgh jargon accordingly all law bad enough in the way of odd words but commend me to scotch law for utter and meaningless incomprehensibility well and what does the second will say ronald here mother cried ronald flinging the letter down hurriedly with a burst of tears ead it yourself if you will for i can poor dear aunt sarah and dear good unselfish ernest it makes me cry even to think of them lady le breton took the paper up from the table without a word and read it carefully through am very glad to hear it she said ery glad indeed to hear it and in order to guard against any misinterpretation of my reasons for making this disposition of my property your aunt says i wish to put it on record that i had previously drawn up another will bequeathing my effects to be divided between my two nephews ernest and ronald le breton equally that i communicated the contents of that will horrid scotticism to my nephew ernest and that at his express desire i have now revoked it and drawn up this present testament leaving the share intended for him to his brother ronald why she never even mentions dear herbert he knew that herbert had provided for himself ronald answered raising his head from his hands hile ernest and i were unprovided for but ernest said he could fight the world for himself while i couldn and that unearned wealth ought only to be accepted in trust for those who were incapacitated by nature or misfortune from earning their own bread i don always quite agree with all ernest theories any more than you do but we must both admit that at least he always conscientiously acts up to them himself mother mustn we t a very extraordinary thing lady le breton went on hat aunt sarah invariably encouraged both you boys in all your absurdities and quixotisms she was quixotic herself at heart that the truth of it just like your poor dear father i remember once when we were quartered at meean meer in the punjaub poor dear sir owen nearly got into disgrace with the colonel e was only a sub in those days ecause he wanted to go trying to convert his syces which was a most imprudent thing to do and directly opposed to the company orders aunt sarah was just the same herbert the only one of you three who has never given me one moment anxiety and of course poor herbert must be passed over in absolute silence however i very glad she left the money to you ronald as you need it the most and mackenzie and anderson say itl come to about a hundred and sixty a year ne can do a great deal of good with that much money said ronald meditatively mean after arranging with you mother for the expenses of my maintenance at home which of course i shall do as soon as the pension ceases and after meeting one own necessary expenditure in the way of clothing and so forth it more than any one christian man ought to spend upon himself i sure t not at all too much for a young man in your position in society ronald but there know youl want to spend half of it on indiscriminate charity however therel be time enough to talk about that when youe actually got it thank goodness ronald murmured a few words softly to himself of which lady le breton only caught the last echo aid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need ust like ernest communistic notions she murmured in return half audibly do declare between them both a plain woman hardly knows whether she standing on her head or on her heels i live in daily fear that one or other of them will be taken up by the police for being implicated in some dynamite plot or other to blow up the queen or destroy the houses of parliament ronald smiled again gently but answered nothing here another letter for you there though with the exmoor coronet upon it why don you open it i hope it an invitation for you to go down and stop at dunbude for a week or two nothing on earth would do you so much good as to get away for a while from your ranters and canters and occasionally in a little decent and rational society ronald took up the second letter with a sigh he feared as much himself and had doleful visions of a painful fortnight to be spent in a big country house where the conversation would be all concerning the slaughter of pheasants and the torture of foxes which his soul loathed to listen to t from lady hilda he said glancing through it nd it isn an invitation after all he could hardly keep down a faint tone of gratification as he discovered this reprieve ere what she says dear mr le breton amma wishes me to write and tell you that lynmouth tutor mr walsh is going to leave us at christmas and she thinks it just possible that one of your two brothers at oxford might like to come down to dunbude and give us their kind aid in taking charge of lynmouth he a dreadful pickle as you know but we are very anxious to get somebody to look after him in whom mamma can have perfect confidence we don know your brothers addresses or we would have written to them direct about it perhaps you will kindly let them hear this suggestion and if they think the matter worth while we might afterwards arrange details as to business and so forth with kind regards to lady le breton believe me yours very sincerely hilda tregellis y dear ronald said lady le breton much more warmly than before his is really quite providential are they at dunbude now o mother she writes from wilton place theye up in town for lord exmoor gout i know i heard they were on sunday hen i shall go and see lady exmoor this very morning about it it exactly the right place for ernest a little good society will get rid of all his nonsensical notions in a month or two he lived too exclusively among his radical set at oxford and then itl be such a capital thing for him to be in the house continually with hilda she a girl of such excellent tone i fancy not quite sure but i fancy hat ernest has a decided taste for the company of people and even of young girls who are not in society he so fond of that young man oswald who herbert tells me is positively the son of a grocer es i sure he said a grocer nd it seems from what herbert writes me that this oswald has brought a sister of his up this term from behind the counter on purpose to set her cap at ernest now you boys have unfortunately no sisters and therefore you haven seen as much of girls of a good stamp ot daily and domestically i mean s is desirable for you from the point of view of society but if ernest can only be induced to take this tutorship at the exmoors hel have an opportunity of meeting daily with a really nice girl like hilda and though of course it isn likely that hilda would take a fancy to her brother tutor he exmoors are such very conservative people in matters of rank and wealth and family and so forth uite unhristianly so i consider et it can fail to improve ernest tone a great deal and raise his standard of female society generally it really a very distressing thought to me ronald that all my boys except dear herbert should show such a marked preference for low and vulgar companionship it seems to me you both positively prefer as far as possible the society of your natural inferiors there ernest must go and take up with the friendship of that snuffy old german socialist glassutter while you are always running after your plymouth brethren and your bible christians and your other ignorant fanatical people instead of going with me respectably to st alphege to hear the dear archdeacon it very discouraging to a mother really very discouraging chapter down the river erkeley couldn come toay le breton it thursday of course i forgot about it altogether oswald said on the barge at salter ou know he pays a mysterious flying visit to town every thursday afternoon o see an imprisoned ladyove i always tell him t very late in the season for taking ladies on the water miss oswald said ernest putting his oar into the rowlock and secretly congratulating himself on the deliverance ut better go now than not see iffley church and nuneham woods at all you ought to have come up in summer term and let us have the pleasure of showing you over the place when it was in its full leafy glory may decidedly the time to see oxford to the greatest advantage o harry tells me and he wanted me to come up then but it wasn convenient for them at home to spare me just at that moment so i was obliged to put it off till late in the autumn i have to help my mother a good deal in the house you know and i can always go dancing about the world whenever i should like to which string must i pull harry to make her turn into the middle of the river she always seems to twist round the exact way i don want her to ight right hard right cried harry from the bow hey were in a tub pair bound down the river for iffley to the oxfordshire shore as far as the willows then cross over to the berkshire le bretonl tell you when and where to change sides he knows the river as well as i do hatl do splendidly for the present ernest said looking ahead over his shoulder ind the flags there don go too near the corner you certainly ought to see these meadows in early spring when the fritillaries are all out over the spongy places miss oswald has your brother ever sent you any of the fritillaries hat snakeeads oh boxes full of them theye lovely flowers but not lovelier than our own devonshire daffodils you should see a devonshire watereadow in april why don you come down some time to calcombe pomeroy it the dearest little peaceful seaside corner in all england harry bit his lip for he was not overond of bringing people down to spy out his domestic sanctities but ernest answered cordially should like it above everything in the world miss oswald if you will let me i certainly shall as soon as possible mind quick get out of the way of that practising eight or we shall foul her left as hard as you can thatl do the cox was getting as red as a salamander till he saw it was a lady steering when coxes catch a man fouling them their language is apt to be highly unparliamentary es i shall try to get away to calcombe as soon as ever i can manage to leave oxford it wouldn surprise me if i were to run down and spend christmas there ou find it as dull as ditchater at christmas le breton said harry uch better wait till next summer sure i don think so harry dear edie interrupted with that tellale blush of hers f mr le breton wants to come then i believe he really find it quite delightful of course he wouldn expect theatres or dances or anything like that in a country village and wee dreadfully busy just about christmas day itself sending out orders and all that sort of thing arry bit his lip again ut if you don mind a very quiet place and a very quiet time mr le breton i don think myself our cliffs ever look grander or our sea more impressive than in stormy winter weather wish to goodness she wasn so transparently candid and guileless thought harry to himself never can teach her duly to respect the prejudices of pi not that it matters twopence to le breton of course but if she talks that way to any of the other men here theyl be laughing in every commonoom in oxford over my christmas raisins and pounds of sugar ommonplace cynics that they are i must tell her about it the moment we get home again and adjure her by all that holy not to repeat the indiscretion penny for your thoughts harry cried edie seeing by his look that she had somehow vexed him hat are you thinking of hinking that all oxford men are horrid cynics said harry boldly shaming the devil hy are they edie asked suppose because it an inexpensive substitute for wit or intellect harry answered ndeed i a bit of a cynic myself i believe for the same reason and on strictly economical principles it saves one the trouble of having any intelligible or original opinion of one own upon any subject below iffley lock they landed for half an hour in order to give edie time for a pencil sketch of the famous old norman churchower with its quaint variations on the dogooth ornament and its ancient cross and mouldering yewree behind harry sat below in the boat propped on the cushions reading the last number of the ineteenth century ernest and edie took their seat upon the bank above and had a first chance of an unbroken t te te ow delicious to live in oxford always said edie sketching in the first outline of the great round arches would give anything to have the opportunity of settling here for life some day i shall make harry set up house and bring me up here as his housekeeper mean she added with a blush thinking of harry warning look just before s soon as they can spare me from home she purposely avoided saying hen they retire from business the first phrase that sprang naturally to her simple little lips et me see mr le breton you haven got any permanent appointment here yourself have you h no ernest answered o appointment of any sort at all miss oswald i loitering up casually on the lookut for a fellowship ie been in for two or three already but haven got them hy didn you asked edie with a look of candid surprise suppose i wasn clever enough ernest answered simply ot so clever i mean as the men who actually got them h but you must be edie replied confidently nd a great deal cleverer too i sure i know you must because harry told me you were one of the very cleverest men in the whole arsity and besides i see you are myself and harry says most of the men who get fellowships are really great donkeys arry must have been talking in one of those cynical moods he told us about said ernest laughing t any rate the examiners didn feel satisfied with my papers and ie never got a fellowship yet perhaps they thought my political economy just a trifle too advanced for them ou may depend upon it that it said edie jumping at the conclusion with the easy omniscience of a girl of nineteen ext time make your political economy a little more moderate you know without any sacrifice of principle just to suit them what fellowship are you going in for now embroke in november h i do hope youl get it hank you very much so do i it would be very nice to have one ut of course it won matter so much to you as it did to harry your family are such very great people aren they ernest smiled a broad smile at her delicious simplicity f by very great people you mean rich he said e couldn very well be poorer or people of our sort i mean my mother lives almost entirely on her pension and we boys have only been able to come up to oxford just as harry was by the aid of our scholarships if we hadn saved in our first two years while we had our government allowances we shouldn have been able to stop up for our degrees at all so if i don get a fellowship i shall have to take to schoolastering or something of the sort for a livelihood indeed this at pembroke will be my very last chance for i can hold on much longer nd if you got a fellowship you could never marry could you asked edie going on with her work ot while i held it certainly but i wouldn hold it long i regard it only as a makeshift for a time unhappily i don know how to earn my own bread by the labour of my hands as i think we ought all to do in a wellonstituted society so unless i choose to starve about the rightfulness of which i don feel quite certai i must manage somehow to get over the interval but as soon as i could i would try to find some useful work to do in which i could repay society the debt i owe it for my bringing up you see ie been fed and educated by a government grant which of course came out of the taxes our people have had to help whether they would or not in paying for my board and lodging nd i feel that i owe it as a duty to the world to look out some employment in which i could really repay it for the cost of my maintenance ow funnily you do look at everything mr le breton said edie t would never have struck me to think of a pension from the army in that light and yet of course it the right light only we don most of us take the trouble to go to the bottom of things as you do but what will you do if you don get the fellowship n that case ie just heard from my mother that she would like me to take a tutorship at lord exmoor ernest answered ynmouth their eldest son was my junior at school by six or seven years and now he going to prepare for christ church i don quite know whether it a right place for me to accept or not but i shall ask max schurz about it if i don get pembroke i always take herr max advice in all questions of conscience for i quite sure whatever he approves of is the thing one ought to do for the greatest good of humanity arry told me about herr schurz edie said filling in the details of the doorway e thinks him a very earnest selfonvinced good old man but a terrible revolutionist for my part i believe i rather like revolutionists provided of course they don cut off people heads harry made me read carlyle and i positively fell in love with camille desmoulins only i don really think he ought to have approved of quite so much guillotining do you but why shouldn you take the tutorship at the exmoors h because it isn a very useful work in the world to prepare a young hereditary loafer like lynmouth for going to christ church lynmouth will be just like his father when he grows up n amiable wholesale partridgelayer and i don see that the world at large will be any the better or the worse off for his being able to grope his way somehow through two plays of sophocles and the first six books of euclid if only one were a shoemaker now what a delightful thing to sit down at the end of a day and say to oneself i have made two pairs of good honest boots for a fellowortal this week and now i deserve to have my supper still itl be better anyway than doing nothing at all and living off my mother f you went to dunbude when would you go fter the christmas vacation i suppose from what lady hilda says ady hilda oh so there a sister is there es a very pretty girl about twenty i should say and rather clever too i believe my mother knows them a little poor little edie what made her heart jump so at the mere mention of lady hilda and what made the last few strokes at the top of the broken yewree look so very weak and shaky how absurd of herself she thought to feel so much moved at hearing that there was another girl in the world whom ernest might possibly fall in love with and yet she had never even seen ernest only ten days ago lady hilda what a grand name to be sure and what a grand person she must be and then ernest himself belonged by birth to the same class for in poor little edie mind innocent as she was of the nice distinctions of the peerage lady sondo was lady sondo still whoever she might be from the wife of a premier marquis to the wife of the latest created knight bachelor to her lady hilda tregellis and lady le breton were both adies of title and the difference between their positions which seemed so immense to ernest seemed nothing at all to the merry little country girl who sat sketching beside him after all how could she ever have even vaguely fancied that such a young man as ernest in spite of all his socialistic whims would ever dream of caring for a girl of the people like her no doubt he would go to the exmoors fall naturally in love with lady hilda and marry decorously in what edie considered his own proper sphere of life she went on with the finishing touches of her little picture in silence and folded it up into the tiny portfolio at last with a halfttered sigh so her poor wee castle in the air was knocked down before she had begun to build it up in any real seriousness and she turned to join harry in the boat almost without speaking hope youl get the pembroke fellowship she said again a little later as they rowed onward down the river to nuneham ut in any case mr le breton you mustn forget youe half promised to come and look us up at calcombe pomeroy in the christmas vacation ernest smiled and nodded acquiescence meanwhile on that same thursday afternoon arthur berkeley had gone up from oxford by the fast train to paddington as was his weekly wont and had dived quickly down one of the small lanes that open out from the leftand side of praed street he walked along it for a little way humming an air to himself as he went and then stopped at last in front of a small decent brick house with a clean muslin blind across the window clean muslin forms a notable object in most london back street and a printed card hanging from the central pane bearing the inscription berkeley working shoemaker he trade supplied with readylosed uppers at the window a beaming face was watching for his appearance and arthur said to himself as he saw it through the curtain he dear old progenitor looking better again this week god bless him in a moment he had opened the door and greeted his father in the old boyish fashion with an honest kiss on either cheek they had kissed one another so whenever they met from arthur childhood upward and the oxford curate had never felt himself grown too much of a man to keep up a habit which seemed to him by far the most sacred thing in his whole existence ell father dear i needn ask you how you are toay said arthur seating himself comfortably in the second easyhair of the trim little workshop parlour can see at once youe a good deal better any more pain in the head and eyes eh or any trouble about the forehead the old shoemaker passed his hand over his big bulging brow bent outward as it is so often in men of his trade by the constant habit of stooping over their work and said briskly o artie my boy not a sign of it this week ot a single sign of it ie been taking a bit of holiday you see and it done me a lot of good i can tell you ade me feel another man entirely ie been playing my violin till the neighbours began to complain of it and if i hadn asked them to come and hear me tune up a bit i really believe they have been having me up before the magistrate for a public nuisance hat right daddy dear i always glad when youe been having a little music it does you more good than anything and the jelly hope youe eaten the jelly h ie eaten it right enough artie thank your dear heart and the soup too dearie came by a boy from walters every day addressed to berkeley esquire whalley street and the boy wouldn leave it the first day because he thought there must have been a mistake about the address his contention was that a journeyman shoemaker wasn an esquire and my contention was that the berkeley was essential and the esquire accidental which was beyond his logic bless you artie for ie often noticed my son that your errandoy is a naturally illogical and contradictory creature now shoemakers aren you know ie always taken a just pride in the profession and ie always asserted that it develops logic it develops logic artie or else why are all cobblers good liberals i should like to know eh can you tell me that with all your oxford training sir can you tell me that t develops logic beyond the possibility of a doubt daddy and it develops a good kind heart as well said arthur smiling nd it develops musical taste and literary talent and a marked predilection for the beautiful in art and nature in fact whenever i meet a good man of any sort anywhere i always begin now by inquiring which of his immediate ancestors can have been a journeyman shoemaker depend upon it daddy there nothing like leather here you are poking fun at your poor old progenitor again said the old cobbler with a merry twinkle in the corner of his eye f it weren for the jelly and the natural affections always engendered by shoemaking i think i should almost feel inclined to cut you off with a shilling artie my boy o cut you off with a shilling well artie i quite convalescent now don you call it i afraid of my long shoemaker words before you nowadays youe grown so literary for i suppose parsons are more literary than even shoemaker i quite convalescent now and i think my boy i must get to work again this week and have no more of your expensive soups and jellies if i didn keep a sharp lookut upon you artie lad i believe you starve yourself outright up there at oxford to pamper your poor old useless father here with luxuries he never been accustomed to in his whole life y dear simple old progenitor you don know how utterly youe mistaken cried arthur eagerly believe i really the most selfish and unnatural son in all christendom i positively rolling in wealth up there at magdalen ie had my room papered again since you saw it last long vacation and i live like a prince absolutely like a russian prince upon my present income i assure you on my solemn word of honour father that i eat meat for lunch hat my dinner very day and an egg for tea as regular as clockwork i often think when i look around my palatial rooms in college what a shame it is that i should let you who are worth ten of me any day live any longer in a back street up here in london and i won allow it daddy i really won allow it from this day forth i determined ie come up especially to speak to you about it this afternoon for ie made up my mind that this abnormal state of things can continue ery good word abnormal murmured his father nd ie also made up my mind arthur said almost firmly for him hat you shall come up and live at oxford i can bear having you so far away from me now that youe weaker than you used to be father dear and so often ailing the old shoemaker laughed aloud h no artie my boy he said cheerily shaking his head with a continuous series of merry chuckles t won do at all it won do i assure you i may be a terrible freehinker and all that kind of thing as the neighbours say i am bodies they never read a word of modern criticism in their lives heaven bless tragglers from the march of intellect mere stragglers ut ie too much respect for the cloth to bring a curate of st fredegond into such disgrace as that would mean for you artie you shan have your career at oxford spoiled by its being said of you that your father was a working shoemaker what with the readylosed uppers and what with your ten shillings a week and what with all the presents you give me and what with the hire of the piano i as comfortable as ever i want to be growing into a gentleman in my old age artie and i even begin to have my doubts as to whether it quite consistent in me as a good radical to continue my own acquaintance with myself getting to be such a regular idle doothing aristocrat go to oxford and mend shoes indeed with you living there as a fullledged parson in your own rooms at magdalen no no i won hear of it il come up for a day or two in long vacation my boy as ie always done hitherto and take a room in holywell and look in upon you a bit accidentally so as not to shame you before the scouts who are a servile set of flunkeys incapable of understanding the elevated feelings of a journeyman shoemake but i wouldn dream of going to live in the place any more than i dream of asking to be presented at court on the occasion of my receiving a commission for a pair of evening shoes for the queen head footman ather said arthur smiling oue absolutely incorrigible such a dreadful old rebel against all constituted authority human and divine i never did meet in the course of my existence i believe youe really capable of arguing a point of theology against an archbishop but i don want you to come up to oxford as a shoemaker i mean you to come up and live with me in rooms of our own out of college whenever i think of you dear father ou who are so infinitely nobler and better and truer and more really a gentleman than any other than i ever knew in my life henever i think of you coming secretly up to oxford as if you were ashamed of yourself and visiting your own son by stealth in his rooms in college as if you were a dun coming to ask him for money instead of the person whom he delights to honour henever i think of it father it makes my cheeks burn with shame and i loathe myself for ever allowing you so to bemean your own frank true noble nature i oughtn to permit it father i oughtn to permit it and i won permit it any longer ell you never would have permitted it artie if i hadn compelled you for ie got all the prudence and common sense of the family bottled up here in my own forehead said the old man tapping his bulging brow significantly don deny that oxford may be an excellent school for greek and latin and philosophy and so forth but if you want prudence and sagacity and commonense it a wellnown fact that there nothing like the practice of making readylosed uppers sir to develop if i taken your advice my boy i have come up to visit you when you were an undergraduate and ruined your prospects at the very outset no no artie i shall stop here and stick to my last my dear boy stick to my last to the end of all things ou shall do nothing of the sort daddy that i determined upon arthur cried vehemently not going to let you do any more shoemaking the time has come when you must retire and devote all your undivided energies to the constant study of modern criticism whether you come to oxford or stop in london ie made up my mind that you shan do another stroke of work as long as you live look here dear old daddy i getting to be a perfect millionaire i assure you do you see this fiver well i got that for knocking out that last trashy little song for fradelli and it cost me no more trouble to compose it than to sit down and write the score out on a sheet of ruled paper i as rich as croesus ade a hundred and eighty pounds last year and expect to make over two hundred this one now if a man with that perfectly prodigious fortune can afford to keep his own father in comfort and affluence what an absolute sybarite and gourmand of a fellow he must be himself t a lot of money certainly artie said the old shoemaker turning it over thoughtfully wo hundred pounds is a lot of money but i doubt very much whether it more than enough to keep you up to the standard of your own society up there at oxford as john stuart mill says these things are all comparative to the standard of comfort of your class now artie i believe you have to stint yourself of things that everybody else about you has at oxford to keep me in luxuries i was never used to y dear dad it only of the nature of a repayment cried arthur earnestly ou slaved and sacrificed and denied yourself when i was a boy to send me to school without which i would never have got to oxford at all and you taught me music in your spare hours when you had an and i owe everything i have or am or ever will be to your unceasing and indefatigable kindness so now youe got to take repayment whether you will or not for i insist upon it and if you won come up to oxford which perhaps would be an uncongenial place for you in many ways il tell you what il do daddy il look out for a curacy somewhere in london and wel take a little house together and il furnish it nicely and there we shall live sir whatever you say so not another word about it and now i want you to listen to the very best thing ie ever composed and tell me what you think of it he sat down to the little hired cottage piano that occupied the corner of the neat small room and began to run his deft fingers lightly over the keys it was the butterfly fantasia the father sat back in his red easyhair listening with all his ears first critically then admiringly at last enthusiastically as arthur closing notes died away softly towards the end the old shoemaker delight could be restrained no longer rtie he cried gloating over it hat music that real music youe quite right my boy that far and away the best thing youe ever written it exquisite o light so airy so unearthlike but artie there more than that in it there soul in it and i know what it means you don deceive your poor old progenitor in a matter of musical inspiration i can tell you i know where you got that fantasia from as well as if i seen you getting it you got it out of your own heart my boy out of your own heart and the thing it says to me as plain as language is just this oue in love youe in love artie and there no good denying it if any man ever wrote that fantasia without being in love at the time irst love cstasy remor iptoe of expectation hy then i tell you music hasn got such a thing as a tongue or a meaning in it arthur looked at him gently and smiled but said nothing ill you tell me about her artie asked the old man caressingly laying his hand upon his son arm ot now father not just now please some other time perhaps but not now i hardly know about it myself yet it may be something t may be nothing but at any rate it was peg enough to hang a fantasia upon youe surprised my little secret father and i dare say it no real secret at all but just a passing whiff of fancy if it ever comes to anything you shall know first of all the world about it now take out your violin there a dear old dad and give me a tune upon it the father took the precious instrument from its carefully covered case with a sort of loving reverence and began to play a piece of arthur own composition from the moment the bow touched the chords it was easy enough to see whence the son got his musical instincts old george berkeley was a born musician and he could make his violin discourse to him with rare power of execution there they sat playing and talking at intervals till nearly eight when arthur went out hurriedly to catch the last train to oxford and left the old shoemaker once more to his week solitude ot for much longer the curate whispered to himself as he got into his thirdlass carriage quickly ot for much longer if i can help it a curacy in or near london the only right thing for me to look out for chapter ghostly counsel november came and with it came the pembroke fellowship examination ernest went in manfully and tried hard to do his best for somehow in spite of the immorality of fellowships he had a sort of floating notion in his head that he would like to get one because he was beginning to paint himself a little fancy picture of a home that was to be with a little fairy edie flitting through it and brightening it all delightfully with her dainty airy presence so he even went so far as to mitigate considerably the native truculence of his political economy paper after edie advice ot of course by making any suggestion of opinions he did not hold but by suppressing the toorominent expression of those he actually believed in max schurz name was not once mentioned throughout the whole ten or twelve pages of closely written foolscap old and the proletariate was utterly ignored and in place of the strong meat served out for men by the apostles of socialism in the marylebone dancingaloon ernest dished up for his examiner edification merely such watery milk for babes as he had extracted from the eminently orthodox economical pages of fawcett mill and thorold rogers he went back to his rooms satisfied that he had done himself full justice and anxiously waited for the result to be duly announced on the saturday morning was it that piece of latin prose too obviously modelled upon the annals of tacitus while the senior tutor was a confirmed ciceronian with the second philippic constitutionally on the brain was it the greek verse containing one senarius with a long syllable before the caesura in the fifth foot as herbert pointed out to his brother on the very evening when that hideous oversight ay rather crime ad been openly perpetrated in plain black and white on a virgin sheet of innocent paper was it some faint ineffaceable savour of the schurzian economics peeping through in spite of all disguises like the garlic in an italian ragout from under the sedulous cloak of ricardo theory of rent was it some flying rumour extrafficial and unconnected with the examination in any way to the effect that young le breton was a person of very dubious religious political and social orthodoxy or was it merely that fortunate dispensation of providence whereby oxford almost invariably manages to let her best men slip unobserved through her fingers and so insures a decent crop of them to fill up her share of the passing vacancies in politics literature science and art heaven or the pembroke examiners alone can answer these abstruse and difficult questions but this much at least is certain that when ernest le breton went into the pembroke porter lodge on the predestined saturday he found another name than his placarded upon the notice board and turned back sick at heart and disappointed to his lonely lodgings there he spent an unhappy hour or two hewing down what remained of his little aerial castle offand and then he went out for a solitary row upon the upper river endeavouring to work off his disappointment like a man with a good hard spell of muscular labour edie had already returned to calcombeomeroy so in the evening he went to tell his misfortune to harry oswald harry was really sorry to hear it for ernest was his best friend in oxford and he had hoped to have him settled close by oul stop up and try again for christ church in february won you le breton he asked o said ernest shaking his head a little gloomily don think i will it clear i not up to the oxford standard for a fellowship and i couldn spend another term in residence without coming down upon my mother to pay my expenses thing she can easily afford to do so i suppose i must fall back for the present upon the exmoor tutorship thatl give me time to look about me till i can get something else to do and after all it isn a bit more immoral than a fellowship when one comes to look it fairly in the face however i shall go first and ask herr max opinion upon the matter going to spend a fortnight in town in the christmas vac said oswald nd i should like to go with you to max again if i may ernest coloured up a little for he would have liked to invite oswald to his mother house and yet he felt there were two reasons why he should not do so he must himself be dependent this time upon his mother hospitality and he didn think lady le breton would be perfectly cordial in her welcome to harry oswald in the end however it was arranged that harry should engage rooms at his former lodgings in london and that ernest should take him once more to call upon the old socialist when he went to consult him on the question of conscience or my part ernest said lady le breton to her son the morning after his return from oxford not altogether sorry you didn get this pembroke fellowship it would have kept you among the same set you are at present mixing in for an indefinite period of course now youl accept lady exmoor kind proposal i saw her about it the same morning we got hilda letter and she offers a year which of course is mere pocket money as your board and lodging are all found for you so to speak and youl have nothing to do but to dress and amuse yourself ell mother i shall see about it i going to consult herr schurz upon the subject this morning err schurz said lady le breton in her bitterest tone of irony t appears to me you make that snuffy old german microscope man your father confessor it very disagreeable to a mother to find that her sons instead of taking her advice about what is most material to their own interests should invariably go to confer with communist refugees and ignorant ranters ronald what is your programme if you please for this morning annoyance ronald with the fear of the fifth commandment steadily before his eyes took no notice of the last word and answered calmly ou know mother this is the regular day for the missionouse prayereeting he missionouse prayereeting i know nothing of the sort i assure you i don keep a perfect calendar in my mind of all your meetings and your religious engagements then i suppose i must go alone to the waltons to see mr walton waterolours give up the prayereeting if you wish it ronald answered with his unvarying meekness nly i afraid i must walk very slowly my cough rather bad this morning o no ernest put in ou mustn dream of going ronald i couldn allow you to walk so far on any account il put off my engagement with oswald who was going with me to herr schurz and il take you round to the waltons mother whenever you like ear me dear me moaned lady le breton piteously pretending to wring her hands in ladyike and mitigated despair can do anything without its being made the opportunity for a scene it seems i shall not go to the waltons and i shall leave you both to follow your own particular devices to your heart content i sorry i proposed anything whatsoever i sure and i shall take care never to do such an imprudent thing again and her ladyship walked in her stateliest and most chilly manner out of the freezing little diningoom t a great cross living always with poor mother ernest said ronald his eyes filling with tears as he spoke ut we must try to bear with her you know for after all she leads a very lonely life herself because she so very unsympathetic ernest took the spare white hand in his and smoothed it compassionately y dear dear ronald he said know it hard for you i must try the best i can to make it a little easier they walked together as far as the missionouse arm in arm for though in some things the two young le bretons were wide apart as the poles in others they were fundamentally at one in inmost spirit and even ronald in spite of his occasional little narrow sectarianisms felt the underlying unity of purpose no less than ernest he was one of those enthusiastic ethereal natures which care little for outer forms or ceremonies and nothing at all for churches and organisations but love to commune as pure spirit with pure spirit living every day a life of ecstatic spirituality and never troubling themselves one whit about theological controversy or established religious constitutions as long as ronald le breton could read his greek testament every morning and talk face to face in their own tongue with the paul of first corinthians or the john of the epistles in the solitude of his own bedroom he was supremely indifferent about the serious question of freeill and forenowledge or about the important question of apostolical succession or even about that other burning question of eternal punishment which was just then setting his own little sect of apostolic christian missioners roundly by the ears these things seemed to his enthusiastic mind mere fading echoes of an alien language all that he himself really cared for in religion was the constant sense of essential personal communion with that higher power which spoke directly to his soul all day long and always or the equally constant sense of moral exaltation which he drew from the reading of the written word in its own original language he had never become an apostolic christian he had grown up to be one unconsciously to himself our son ronald religion my dear lady le breton archdeacon luttrell used often to say s i fear too purely emotional he cannot be made to feel sufficiently the necessity for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal christianity to ronald himself he might as well have talked about the necessity for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal buddhism and if ronald had really met a devout buddhist he would doubtless have found after half an hour conversation that they were at one in everything save the petty matter of dialect and vocabulary at oswald lodging ernest found his friend ready and waiting for him they went on together to the same street in marylebone as before and mounted the stair till they reached herr schurz gloomy little workoom on the third floor the old apostle was seated at his small table by the halfpen window grinding the edges of a lens to fit the brass mounting at his side while his daughter uta a still goodooking quiet broadaced south german woman about forty or a little more sat close by busily translating a scientific book into english by alternate reading and consultation with her father harry saw the title on her page was esearches into the embryology of the isopodal crustaceans and conceived at once an immense respect for the learning and wisdom of the communist exile daughter herr schurz hardly stopped a moment from his work e never allowed his numerous visitors to interfere in any way with his daily duties ut motioned them both to seats on the bare bench beside him and waited to bear the nature of their particular business it was an understood thing that no one came to see the socialist leader on week days except for a good and sufficient reason the talk at first was general and desultory but after a little time ernest brought conversation round to its proper focus and placed his case of conscience fairly before his father confessor was it allowable for a consistent socialist to accept the place of tutor to the son of a peer and a landowner or my part herr schurz oswald said confidently don see any reason on earth from the point of view of any political economy whatsoever why ernest shouldn take the position the question isn how the exmoors have come by their money even allowing that private property in land is in itself utterly indefensible which is a proposition i don myself feel inclined unreservedly to admit though i know you and le breton do the real question this ince theye got this money into their hands to distribute and since in any case they will have the distribution of it isn it better that some of it should go into le breton pocket than that it should go into any other person that the way i for my part look at the matter hat do you say to that friend ernest asked the old german smiling and waiting to see whether ernest would detect what from their own standpoint he regarded as the ethical fallacy of harry oswald argument ell to tell you the truth herr schurz answered ernest in his deliberate quiet way don think ie envisaged the subject to myself from quite the same point of view as oswald has done i have rather asked myself whether it was right of a man to accept a function in which he would really be doing nothing worthy for humanity in return for his daily board and lodging it isn so much a question who exactly is to get certain sums out of the exmoors pockets which ought no doubt never to have been in them it more a question whether a man has any right to live off the collective labour of the world and do nothing of any good to the world on his own part by way of repayment hat it friend ernest cried the old man with a pleased nod of his big grey head he socialistic iliad in a nutshell that the very root of the question don be deceived by capitalist sophisms so long as we go on each of us trying to get as much as we can individually out of the world instead of asking what the world is getting out of us in return there will be no revolution and no millennium we must make sure that wee doing some good ourselves instead of sponging upon the people perpetually to feed us for nothing what the first gospel given to man at the creation in your popular cosmogonies why that in the sweat of his face shall he eat bread and till the ground from which he was taken that the native gospel of the toiling many always your doctrines of fair exchange and honest livelihoods and free contract and all the rest of it are only the artificial gospel of the political economists and of the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats into whose hands they play he rascals hen you think i oughtn to take the post asked ernest a little ruefully don say that le breton don say that said herr schurz more quietly than before still grinding away at his lens he question a broad one and it has many aspects the best work a man can do is undoubtedly the most useful work he work that conduces most to the general happiness but we of the proletariate can take our choice always as your english proverb plainly puts it with your true english bluntness beggars mustn be choosers we must each in his place do the work that set before us by the privileged classes it impossible for us to go nicely discriminating between work that useful for the community work that merely harmless and work that positively detrimental how can we insure it a man a printer say there a generally useful trade in which on the whole he labours for the good and enlightenment of the world or he may print scientific books good books useful books and most printing on the average is useful but how he to know what sort of thing he printing he may be printing gold and the proletariate or he may be printing obscurantist and retrogressive treatises by the enemies of humanity look at my own trade again you say at first sight mr oswald that to make microscopes must be a good thing in the end for the world at large and so it is no doubt but half of them y more than half of them re thrown away mere wasted labour a good workman time and skill lavished needlessly on some foolish rich man caprices and amusement often enough now i make a good instrument n instrument with all its fittings worth fifty or a hundred pounds that takes a long time to make and i a skilled workman and the instrument may fall into the hands of a scientific man whol use it in discovery in verification in promoting knowledge in lessening disease and mitigating human suffering that the good side of my trade but mark you now and the old man wiped his forehead rapidly with his sleeve t has its bad side too as often as not i know some rich man will buy that machine that cost me so much time and trouble to make and will buy a few dozen stock slides with it and will bring it out once in a moon to show his children or a few idle visitors the scales on a butterfly wing or the hairs on the leg of a common flea uta sets those things up by the thousand for the dealers to sell to indolent dilettanti the appetite of the world at large for the common flea is simply insatiable and it for that perhaps that i spoiling my eyesight now grinding and grinding and grinding at this very lens and fitting the thing to an accurate fraction of a millimetre as we always fit these things e who are careful and honest workmen o show an idle man friends the hairs on a flea foreeg if that isn enough to make a man ashamed of our present wasteful and chaotic organisation i should think he must be a survival from the preglacial epoch s indeed most of us actually are ut after all herr schurz said harry expostulating ou get paid for your labour and the rich man is doing better by encouraging your skill than by encouraging the less useful skill of other workmen h yes cried herr schurz warmly hat the doctrine of the oneyed economists that the capitalist way of looking at it but it isn our way t isn ours is it nothing think you that all that toil of mine f a sensible man oes to waste to gratify the senseless passing whim of a wealthy nobody is it nothing that he uselessly monopolises the valuable product of my labour which in other and abler hands might be bringing forth good fruit for the bettering and furthering of universal humanity i tell you mr oswald half the best books half the best apparatus half the best appliances in all europe are locked up idle in rich men cabinets effecting no good begetting no discoveries bringing forth no interest doing nothing but foster the antiocial pride of their wealthy possessors but that isn what friend ernest wants to ask me about toay he wants to know about his own course in a difficult case and instead of answering him here am i maundering away like an old man that i am into the generalised platitudes of gold and the proletariate well le breton what i should say in your particular instance is this a man with the fear of right before his eyes may under existing circumstances lawfully accept any work that will keep him alive provided he sees no better and more useful work equally open to him he may take the job the capitalists impose if he can get nothing worthier to do elsewhere now if you don teach this young tregellis what alternative have you why to become a master in a school ton perhaps or rugby or marlborough nd teach other equally useless members of prospective aristocratic society that being so i think you ought to do what best for yourself and your family for the present or the present ill the time of deliverance comes you see there is one member of your family to whom the matter is of immediate importance onald said ernest interrupting him es ronald a good boy a socialist too though he doesn know it ne of us born of us and only apart from us in bare externals well would it be most comfortable for poor ronald that you should go to these exmoor people or that you should take a mastership get rooms somewhere and let him live with you he not very happy with your mother you say wouldn he be happier with you what think you charity begins at home you know a good proverb good sound sensible narrowinded practical english proverb e thought of that ernest said nd il ask him about it whichever he prefers then i better decide upon had i o so herr max answered with a nod ther things equal our first duty is to those nearest to us what herr max said was law to his disciples and ernest went his way contented r oswald seems a very nice young man uta schurz said looking up from the microscope slides she had begun to mount at the moment her regular translating work was interrupted by their sudden entry she had been taking quiet glances at harry all the while in her unobtrusive fashion for uta had learned always to be personally unobtrusive he prophet donkey those irreverent french exiles used to call her nd she had come to the conclusion that he was a decidedly handsome and manly fellow hich do you like best uta swald or le breton asked her father ersonally uta answered should prefer mr oswald to live always with mr le breton would be like living with an abstraction no woman would ever care for him she might just as well marry spinoza ethics or the ten commandments he a perfect model of a socialist and nothing else mr oswald has some human nature in him as well here are two kinds of socialists said herr max bending once more over his glasses he one kind is always thinking most of its rights the other kind is always thinking most of its duties oswald belongs to the first le breton to the second ie often observed it so among men of their two sorts the best socialists never come from the bourgeoisie nor even from the proletariate they come from among the voluntarily class s aristocrats your workman or your bourgeois who has risen and who interests himself in social or political questions is always thinking why shouldn i have as many rights and privileges as these other people have the aristocrat who descends is always thinking why shouldn these other people have as many rights and privileges as i have the one type begets aggressive selfssertion the other type begets a certain gentle spirit of selfffacement you don often find men of the aristocratic class with any ethical element in them heir hereditary antecedents their breeding their environment are all hostile to it but when you do find them mark my words uta they make the truest and most earnest friends of the popular cause of any their sympathy and interest in it is all unselfish nd yet uta answered firmly still prefer mr oswald and if you care for my opinion i should say that the aristocrat does all the dreaming but the bourgeois does all the fighting and that the most important thing practically after all an hour later ernest was talking his future plans over with his brother ronald would it be best for ronald that he should take a mastership and both should live together or that he should go for the present to the exmoors and leave the question of ronald home arrangements still unsettled t so good of you to think of me in the matter ernest ronald said pressing his hand gently ut i don think i ought to go away from mother before i twentyne to tell you the truth ernest i hardly flatter myself she be really sorry to get rid of me i afraid i a dreadful thorn in her side at present she doesn understand my ways and perhaps i don sympathise enough with hers but still if i were to propose to go i feel sure she be very much annoyed and treat it as a serious act of insubordination on my part while i a minor at least i ought to remain with her the apostle tells us to obey our parents in the lord and as long as she requires nothing from me that doesn involve a dereliction of principle i think i must bear with it though i acknowledge it a cross a heavy cross thank you so much for thinking of it dearest ernest and his eyes filled once more with tears as he spoke so it was finally arranged that for the present at least ernest should accept lady exmoor offer and that as soon as ronald was twentyne he should look about for a suitable mastership in order for the two brothers to go immediately into rooms together lady le breton was surprised at the decision but as it was in her favour she wisely abstained from gratifying her natural desire to make some more uncomplimentary references to the snuffy old german socialist sufficient unto the day was the triumph thereof and she had no doubt in her own mind that if once ernest could be induced to live for a while in really good society the wellnown charms and graces of that society must finally tame his rugged breast and wean him away from his unaccountable devotion to those horrid continental communists chapter in the camp of the philistines dunbude castle lord exmoor family seat stands on the last spurs of the great north devon uplands overlooking the steep glen of a little boulderncumbered stream and commanding a distant view of the severn sea and the dim outlines of the blue welsh hills beyond it behind the house a castle only by courtesy on the same principle as that by which every bishop lives in a palac rises the jagged summit of the cleave a great weatherorn granite hill sculptured on top by wind and rain into those fantastic lichenovered pillars and tora and logans in which antiquarian fancy used so long to find the visible monuments of druidical worship all around a wide brown waste of heather undulates and tosses wildly to the sky and on the summit of the rolling moor where it rises and swells in one of its many rounded bosses the antlered heads and shoulders of the red deer may often be seen etched in bold relief against the clear skyine to the west on sunny autumn evenings but the castle itself and the surrounding grounds are not planned to harmonise with the rough moorland english scenery into whose midst they were unceremoniously pitchforked by the second earl that distinguished man of taste a light of the artistic world in his own day had brought back from his grand tour his own ideal of a strictly classical domestic building formed by impartially compounding a palladian palace a doric temple and a square redbrick english manorouse after pulling down the original fourteenthentury castle he had induced an eminent architect of the time to conspire with him in giving solid and permanent reality to this his awful imagining and when he had completed it all from portico to attic he had extorted even the critical praise of horace walpole who described it in one of his letters as a ingular triumph of classical taste and architectural ingenuity it still remains unrivalled in its kind the ugliest great countryeat in the county of devon ome respectable authorities even say in the whole of england in front of the house an italian garden with balustrades of very doubtful marble leads down by successive terraces and broad flights of steps to an artificial octagonal pool formed by carefully destroying the whole natural beauty of the wild and rocky little english glen beneath to feed it by fitting a conduit the mossrown boulders that strew the bed of the torrent above and below have been carefully removed and the unwilling stream as it runs into the pool has been coerced into a long straight channel bordered on either side by bedded turf and planed off at measured intervals so as to produce a series of eminently regular and classical cascades even lord exmoor himself who was a hunting man without any pretence to that stupid rubbish about taste did not care for the hopeless exterior of dunbude castle he frankly admitted that the place was altogether too doosid artificial for the line of country if they only left it alone he said in its own native condition it would have been really pretty but as they doctored it and spoilt it why there was nothing on earth to be done but just put up with it and whistle over it what with the hounds and the mortgages and the settlements and the red deer and goodwood the estate couldn possibly afford any money for making alterations down in the gardens the dogart was in waiting at the station to carry ernest up to the castle and as he reached the front door lady hilda tregellis strolled up the broad flight of steps from the garden to meet him lady hilda was tall and decidedly handsome as ernest had rightly told edie but not pretty and she was also just twenty there was a free careless bold look in her face that showed her at once a girl of spirit indeed if she had not been born a tregellis it was quite clear that she would have been predestined to turn out a stronginded woman there was nothing particularly delicate in lady hilda features they were wellodelled but neither regular nor cold nor with that peculiar stamp of artificial breeding which is so often found in the faces of english ladies on the contrary she looked like a perfectly selfonfident handsome actress too selfonfident to be selfonscious and accustomed to admiration wherever she turned as ernest jumped down from the dogart she advanced quickly to shake hands with him and look him over critically from head to foot like a schoolboy taking stock of a new fellow so glad youe come mr le breton she said with an open smile upon her frank face was dreadfully afraid you wouldn care for our proposition dunbude the dullest hole in england and we want somebody here to brighten it up sadly did you ever see such an ugly monstrosity before anywhere he country about lovely ernest answered ut the house itself is certainly rather ugly gly it hideous and it as dull as it big said hilda vehemently ou can think what a time we have of it here half the year i always longing for the season to come papa fills the house here with hunting men and shooting men eople without two ideas in their heads you know just like himself and even they go out all day and leave us women from morning till night to the society of their wives and daughters who are exactly like them mr walsh hat lynmouth last tutor e was a perfect stick a cambridge man cambridge men always are sticks i believe youe oxford of course aren you i thought so still even mr walsh was a little society for i assure you if it hadn been for him i should never have seen anybody to talk to from year end to year end so when mr walsh was going to leave us i said to mamma why not ask one of the mr le bretons i wanted to have somebody sensible here and so i got her to let me write to your brother ronald about the tutorship did he send you the letter i hope you didn think it was mine mamma dictated it for i don write such formal letters as that on my own account i can tell you i hate conventionality of any sort at dunbude wee all conventional except me but i won be come up into the billiardoom here and sit down awhile william will see about your portmanteau and things papa out of course and so lynmouth and mamma somewhere or other i don know where and so there nobody in particular at home for you to report yourself to you may as well come in here while i ring for them to get you some lunch ready nobody ever gets anything ready beforehand in this house we lunched ourselves an hour ago ernest smiled at her volubility and followed her quickly into the big bare billiardoom he walked over to the fire and began to warm himself while hilda took down a cue and made stray shots in extraordinary angles at impossible cannons all the time as she went on talking to him as it very cold on the way down she asked es fairly i not sorry to see the fire again why youe quite an accomplished player here nothing else to do at dunbude that why i practise about half my lifetime so i wrote to your brother ronald as i was telling you from mamma dictation and when i heard you were really coming i was quite delighted about it do you remember i met you twice last year once at the dolburys and once somewhere else and i thought you be a very good sort of person for dunbude you know and about as much use to lynmouth as anybody could be which isn saying much of course for he a dreadful pickle i insisted on putting in my letter that he was a dreadful pickle that a good stroke off the red just enough side o though mamma didn want me to because i thought you ought to know about it beforehand but you remember him at marlborough of course he was only a little fellow then but still a pickle he always was and he always will be he out shooting now with papa and youl never get him to settle down to anything as long as there a snipe or a plover banging about on the moor anywhere he quite incorrigible do you play at all won you take a cue till your lunch ready o i don play ernest answered half hesitating r at least very little h then youl learn here because youl find nothing else to do do you shoot h no never i don think it right h yes i remember how delightful lady le breton told me all about it youe got notions haven you youe a nihilist or a fenian or something of that sort and you don shoot anything but czars and grand dukes do you i believe you want to cut all our heads off and have a red republic well i sure that very refreshing for down here wee all as dull as sticks together tories every one of us to a man perfect unanimity no differences of opinion all as conventional and proper as the vicar sermons now to have somebody who wants to cut your head off in the house is really delightful i love originality not that ie ever seen anybody original in all my life for i haven but i sure it would be delightful if i did one reads about original people in novels you know dickens and that sort of thing and i often think i should like to meet some of them good stroke again legs legs legs if you please o it hasn legs enoug but here or for the matter of that in town either we never see anybody but the same eternal round of algies and monties and berties and hughs very nice young men no doubt exceedingly proper nothing against them good shots capital partners excellent families everything on earth that anybody could desire except a single atom of personal originality i assure you if they were all shaken up in a bag together and well mixed in evening clothes so as not to tell them apart by the tweeds you kno their own mothers wouldn be able to separate them afterwards but if you don shoot and don play billiards i sure i don know what youl ever find to do with yourself here at dunbude on you think ernest said quietly taking down a cue ne ought to have something better to do with one time than shooting and playing billiards in a world where so many labouring people are toiling and slaving in poverty and misery on our behalf don you think we should be trying to do something or other in return for universal humanity to whom we owe so much for our board and lodging and clothing and amusement ell now that just what i mean said hilda ecstatically with a neat shot off the cushion against the red and into the middle pocket hat such a delightfully original way of looking at things you see we all of us here talk always about the partridges and the red deer and the turnips and the church and dear lady this and that odious lady that and the growing insolence of the farmers and the shocking insubordination of the lower classes and the difficulty of getting really good servants and the dreadful way those horrid irish are shooting their kindearted indulgent landlords or else we talk he women especially bout how awfully bored we are lawnennis you know and dinners and what a bad match ethel thingumbob has made but you talk another kind of slang i dare say it doesn mean much you know youe not working at anything very much more serious than we are still it a novelty when we go to a coursing meeting wee all on the hounds but youe on the hare and that so delightfully original i haven the least doubt that if we were to talk about the irish you say you thought they ought to shoot their landlords i remember you shocked mamma by saying something like it at the dolburys now of course it doesn matter to me a bit which is right you say the poor tenants are starving and papa says the poor landlords can get in their rents and actually have to give up their hounds poor fellows and i don know which of you is the most to be believed only what papa says is just the same thing that everybody says and what you say has a certain charming freshness and variety about it it so funny to be told that one ought really to take the tenants into consideration exactly like your brother ronald notions about servants our lunch is ready in the diningoom sir said a voice at the door ome back here when youe finished mr le breton hilda called after him teach you how to make that cannon you missed just now if you mean to exist at dunbude at all it absolutely necessary for you to learn billiards ernest turned in to lunch with an uncomfortable misgiving on his mind already that dunbude was not exactly the right place for such a man as he to live in during the afternoon he saw nothing more of the family save lady hilda and it was not till the party assembled in the drawingoom before dinner that he met lord and lady exmoor and his future pupil lynmouth had grown into a tall handsome manlyooking boy since ernest last saw him but he certainly looked exactly what hilda had called him pickle a few minutes introductory conversation sufficed to show ernest that whatever mind he possessed was wholly given over to horses dogs and partridges and that the post of tutor at dunbude castle was not likely to prove a bed of roses the paper connemara lord exmoor asked of one of his guests as they sat down to dinner haven had a moment myself to snatch a look at the times yet this evening i really too busy almost even to read the daily papers anything fresh from ireland aven seen it either lord connemara answered glancing towards lady hilda erhaps somebody else has looked at the papers nobody answered so ernest ventured to remark that the irish news was rather worse again two bailiffs had been murdered near castlebar hat bad lord exmoor said turning towards ernest afraid there a deal of distress in the west great deal ernest answered ositive starvation i believe in some parts of county galway ell not quite so bad as that lord exmoor replied a little startled don think any of the landlords are actually starving yet though ie no doubt many of them are put to very great straits indeed by their inability to get in their rents ernest couldn forbear gently smiling to himself at the misapprehension h i didn mean the landlords he said quickly meant among the poor people as he spoke he was aware that lady hilda eyes were fixed keenly upon him and that she was immensely delighted at the temerity and originality displayed in the notion of his publicly taking irish tenants into consideration at her father table h the poor people lord exmoor answered with a slight sigh of relief as who should say that their condition didn much matter to a philosophic mind es to be sure ie no doubt some of them are very badly off poor souls but then theye such an idle improvident lot why don they emigrate now i should like to know ernest reflected silently that the inmates of dunbude castle did not exactly set them a model of patient industry and that lady hilda numerous allusions during the afternoon to the fact that the dunbude estates were ortgaged up to the eyelids a condition of affairs to which she always alluded as though it were rather a subject of pride and congratulation than otherwis did not speak very highly for their provident economy either but even ernest le breton had a solitary grain of worldly wisdom laid up somewhere in a corner of his brain and he didn think it advisable to give them the benefit of his own views upon the subject here a great deal of rubbish talked in england about irish affairs you know exmoor said lord connemara confidently eople never understand ireland i sure until theye actually lived there would you believe it now the correspondent of one of the london papers was quite indignant the other day because my agent had to evict a man for three years rent at ballynamara and the man unfortunately went and died a week later on the public roadside we produced medical evidence to show that he had suffered for years from heart disease and would have died in any case wherever he had been but the editor fellow wanted to make political capital out of it and kicked up quite a fuss about my agent shocking inhumanity as if we could possibly help ourselves in the matter people must get their rents in somehow mustn they eople must get their rents in somehow of course lord exmoor assented sympathetically nd i know all you men who are unlucky enough to own property in ireland have a lot of trouble about it nowadays upon my word what with fenians and what with nihilists and what with communards i really don know what the world is coming to ost unchristian conduct i call it said lady exmoor who went in for being mildly and decorously religious really can understand how people can believe such wicked doctrines as these communistic notions that are coming over people in these latter days o better than downright robbery lord connemara answered haking the very foundations of society i think it all done so recklessly too without any care or any consideration ernest thought of old max schurz with his lifelong economical studies and wondered when lord connemara had found time to turn his own attention from foxes and fishing to economical problems but by a perfect miracle he said nothing ou wouldn believe the straits wee put to lady exmoor the irish earl went on hrough this horrid noent business absolute poverty i assure you bsolute downright poverty ie had to sell the maid of garunda this week you know and three others of the best horses in my stable just to raise money for immediate necessities wanted to buy a most interesting missal quite unique in its way offered me by menotti and cicolari dirt cheap for three thousand guineas it quite a gem of late miniaturist art ellum folio with borders and headieces by giulio clovio a marvellous bargain iulio clovio said lord exmoor doubtfully ho was he never heard of him in my life before ever heard of giulio clovio cried lord connemara seizing the opportunity with wellffected surprise ou really astonish me he was a croatian i believe or an illyrian forget which nd he studied at rome under giulio romano wonderful draughtsman in the nude and fine colourist took hints from raphael and michael angelo so much he had picked up from menotti and cicolari and being a distinguished connoisseur had made a mental note of the facts at once for future reproduction upon a fitting occasion ell this missal was executed for cardinal farnese as a companion volume to the famous vita christi in the towneley collection you know it of course lady exmoor f course lady exmoor answered faintly with a devout hope that lord connemara wouldn question her any further upon the subject in which case she thought it would probably be the safest guess to say that she had seen it at the british museum or in the hamilton library but lord connemara luckily didn care to press his advantage he towneley volume you see he went on fluently e was primed to the muzzle with information on that subject as given by the cardinal to the pope of that time aul the third wasn it mr le breton nd so got into the possession of old christopher towneley the antiquary but this companion folio it seems the cardinal wouldn let go out of his own possession and so it been handed down in his own family with a bar sinister of course exmoor ou remember the story of beatrice malatesta to the present time it very existence wasn suspected till cicolari onderfully smart fellow cicolari nearthed it the other day from a descendant of the malatestas in a little village in the campagna he offered it to me quite as an act of friendship for three thousand guineas indeed he begged me not to let menotti know how cheap he was selling it for fear he might interfere and ask a higher price for it well i naturally couldn let such a chance slip me or the credit of the family it ought to be in the collection nd the consequence was though i was awfully sorry to part with her i was absolutely obliged to sell the maid for pocketoney lady hilda assure you for pocketoney my tenants won pay up and nothing will make them theye got the cash actually in the bank but they keep it there waiting for a set of sentimentalists in the house of commons to interfere between us and make them a present of my property rolling in money some of them are i can tell you one man i know as a positive fact sold a pig last week and yet pretends he can pay me all the fault of these horrid communists that you were speaking of lady exmoor the fault of these horrid communists oue rather a communist yourself aren you mr le breton asked lady hilda boldly from across the table remember you told me something once about cutting the throats of all the landlords lady exmoor looked as though a bombhell had dropped into the drawingoom y dear hilda she said sure you must have misunderstood mr le breton you can have meant anything so dreadful as that mr le breton can you ertainly not ernest answered with a clear conscience ady hilda has put her own interpretation upon my casual words i haven the least desire to cut anybody throat even metaphorically hilda looked a little disappointed she had hoped for a good rattling discussion in which ernest was to shock the whole table t does people such a lot of good you know to have a nice round shocking but ernest was evidently not inclined to show fight for her sole gratification and so she proceeded to her alternative amusement of getting lord connemara to display the full force of his own inanity this was an easy and unending source of innocent enjoyment to lady hilda enhanced by the fact that she knew her father and mother were anxious to see her countess of connemara and that they would be annoyed by her public exposition of that eligible young man intense selfishness and emptyeadedness altogether ernest did not enjoy his first week at the exmoors nor did he enjoy the second or the third or the fourth week much better the society was profoundly distasteful to him the world was not his world nor the talk his talk and he grew so sick of the perpetual discussion of horses dogs pheasants dances and lawn tennis with occasional digressions on giulio clovio and the connemara gallery that he found even a chat with lady hilda who knew and cared for nothing but liked to chat with him because he was o original a pleasant relief by comparison from the eternal round of lord exmoor anecdotes about famous racers or celebrated actresses but worst of all he did not like his work he felt that useless as he considered it he was not successfully performing even the useless function he was paid to fulfil lynmouth couldn learn wouldn learn and wasn going to learn ernest might as well have tried to din the necessary three plays of euripides into the nearest lampost nobody encouraged him to learn in any way indeed lord exmoor remembered that he himself had scraped through somehow at christ church with the aid of a private tutor and the magic of his title and he hadn the least doubt that lynmouth would scrape through in his turn in like manner and so though most young men would have found the dunbude tutorship the very acme of their wishes lenty of amusements and nothing to do for them rnest le breton found it to the last degree irksome and unsatisfactory not that he had ever to complain of any unkindliness on the part of the exmoor family they were really in their own way very kindearted friendly sort of people hat is to say towards all members of their own circle and as they considered ernest one of themselves in virtue of their acquaintance with his mother they really did their best to make him as happy and comfortable as was in their power but then he was such a very strange young man or what on earth can you do as lord exmoor justly asked ith a young fellow who won shoot and who won fish and who won hunt and who won even play lansquenet such a case was clearly hopeless he would have liked to see more of miss merivale little lady sybil governess for there were three children in the famil but miss merivale was a timid sensitive girl and she did not often encourage his advances lest my lady should say she was setting her cap at the tutor the consequence was that he was necessarily thrown much upon lady hilda society and as lady hilda was laudably eager to instruct him in billiards lawn tennis and sketching he rapidly grew to be quite an adept at those relatively moral and innocuous amusements under her constant instruction and supervision t seems to me said that acute observer lord lynmouth to his special friend and confidante the ladyaid hat hilda makes a doocid sight too free with that fellow le breton don you think so euphemia should hope my lord euphemia answered demurely hat lady hilda would know her own place too well to demean herself with such as your lordship tutor if i didn feel sure of that i should have to mention the matter seriously to my lady nevertheless the ladyaid immediately stored up a mental note on the subject in the lasting tablets of her memory and did not fail gently to insinuate her views upon the question to lady exmoor as she arranged the pearls in the false plaits for dinner that very evening chapter the women of the land r le breton mr le breton papa says lynmouth may go out troutishing with him this afternoon come up with me to the clatter i going to sketch there ery well lady hilda if you want my criticism i don mind if i do let me carry your things it rather a pull up even for you with your box and easel hilda gave him her sketchook and colours and they turned together up the cleave behind the castle a clatter is a peculiar devonshire feature composed of long loose tumbled granite blocks piled in wild disorder along the narrow summit of a saddleacked hill it differs from a tor in being less high and castellated as well as in its longer and narrower contour ernest and hilda followed the rough path up through the gorse and heather to the top of the ridge and then scrambled over the grey lichenovered rooks together to the big logantone whose evenlyoised and tilted mass crowned the actual summit the granite blocks were very high and rather slippery in places for it was rainy april weather so that ernest had to take his companion hand more than once in his to help her over the tallest boulders it was a small delicate hand though hilda was a tall wellrown woman ungloved too for the sake of the sketching and hilda didn seem by any means unwilling to accept ernest proffered help though if it had been lord connemara who was with her instead she would have scorned assistance and scaled the great mossy masses by herself like a mountain antelope lightooted and lithe of limb was lady hilda as befitted a devonshire lass accustomed to following the exmoor stagounds across their wild country on her own hunter yet she seemed to find a great deal of difficulty in clambering up the clatter on that particular april morning and move than once ernest half fancied to himself that she leaned on his arm longer than was absolutely necessary for support or assistance over the stiffest places ere by the logan mr le breton she said motioning him where to put her camptool and papers hat a good point of view for the rocks yonder you can lie down on the rug and give me the benefit of your advice and assistance y advice is not worth taking said ernest a regular duffer at painting and sketching you should ask lord connemara he knows all about art and that sort of thing ord connemara echoed hilda contemptuously e has a lot of pictures in his gallery at home and he been told by sensible men what the right thing for him to say about them but he knows no more about art really than he knows about fiddlesticks oesn he indeed ernest answered languidly not feeling any burning desire to discuss lord connemara artistic attainments or deficiencies o he doesn hilda went on rather defiantly as though ernest had been lady exmoor nd most of these people that come here don either they have galleries and they get artists and people who understand about pictures to talk with them and so they learn what considered the proper thing to say of each of them but as to saying anything spontaneous or original of their own about a picture or any other earthly thing hy you know mr le breton they couldn possibly do it to save their lives ell there i should think you do them as a class a great injustice said ernest quietly oue evidently prejudiced against your own people i should think that if there any subject on which our old families really do know anything it art look at their great advantages onsense hilda answered decisively iddlesticks for their advantages what the good of advantages without a head on your shoulders i should like to know and they haven got heads on their shoulders mr le breton you know they haven hy surely said ernest in his simple fashion looking the question straight in the face as a matter of abstract truth here must be a great deal of ability among peers and peers sons all history shows it and it would be absurd if it weren so for the mass of peers have got their peerages by conspicuous abilities of one sort or another as barristers or soldiers or politicians or diplomatists and they would naturally hand on their powers to their different descendants h yes there are some of them with brains i suppose hilda answered as one who makes a great concession here herbert alderney who member for somewhere or other hurch stretton i think nd makes speeches in the house he clever they say but such a conceited fellow to talk to and there wilfrid faunthorp who writes poems and gets them printed in the magazines too because he knows the editors and there randolph hastings who goes in for painting and has little red and blue daubs at the grosvenor by special invitation of the director but somehow they none of them strike me as being really original whenever i meet anybody worth talking to anywhere n a railway train or so on feel sure at once he an ordinary commoner not even honourable and he is invariably you may depend upon it hat would naturally happen on the average of instances ernest put in smiling onsidering the relative frequency of peers and commoners in this realm of england peers you know or even honourables are not common objects of the country numerically speaking hey are to me unfortunately hilda replied looking at him inquiringly hardly ever meet anybody else you know and i positively bored to death by them and that the truth really it most unlucky under the circumstances that i should happen to be the daughter of one peer and be offered promiscuously as wife to the highest bidder among half a dozen others if only i would have them but i won mr le breton i really won i not going to marry a fool
