of man first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore us and regain the blissful

pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer before all temples th upright heart and pure instruct me for thou knowt thou from the first wast present and with mighty wings outspread doveike satt brooding on the vast abyss and madt it pregnant what in me is dark illumine what is low raise and support that to the height of this great argument i may assert eternal providence and justify the ways of god to men say first or heaven hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell ay first what cause moved our grand parents in that happy state favoured of heaven so highly to fall off from their creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world besides who first seduced them to that foul revolt th infernal serpent he it was whose guile stirred up with envy and revenge deceived the mother of mankind what time his pride had cast him out from heaven with all his host of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring to set himself in glory above his peers he trusted to have equalled the most high if he opposed and with ambitious aim against the throne and monarchy of god raised impious war in heaven and battle proud with vain attempt him the almighty power hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy th omnipotent to arms nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men he with his horrid crew lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf confounded though immortal but his doom reserved him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witnessed huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate at once as far as angels ken he views the dismal situation waste and wild a dungeon horrible on all sides round as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames no light but rather darkness visible served only to discover sights of woe regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all but torture without end still urges and a fiery deluge fed with everurning sulphur unconsumed such place eternal justice has prepared for those rebellious here their prison ordained in utter darkness and their portion set as far removed from god and light of heaven as from the centre thrice to th utmost pole oh how unlike the place from whence they fell there the companions of his fall orwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltering by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine and named beelzebub to whom th archnemy and thence in heaven called satan with bold words breaking the horrid silence thus began if thou beest he ut o how fallen how changed from him who in the happy realms of light clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine myriads though bright f he whom mutual league united thoughts and counsels equal hope and hazard in the glorious enterprise joined with me once now misery hath joined in equal ruin into what pit thou seest from what height fallen so much the stronger proved he with his thunder and till then who knew the force of those dire arms yet not for those nor what the potent victor in his rage can else inflict do i repent or change though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind and high disdain from sense of injured merit that with the mightiest raised me to contend and to the fierce contentions brought along innumerable force of spirits armed that durst dislike his reign and me preferring his utmost power with adverse power opposed in dubious battle on the plains of heaven and shook his throne what though the field be lost all is not lost he unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me to bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify his power who from the terror of this arm so late doubted his empire hat were low indeed that were an ignominy and shame beneath this downfall since by fate the strength of gods and this empyreal substance cannot fail since through experience of this great event in arms not worse in foresight much advanced we may with more successful hope resolve to wage by force or guile eternal war irreconcilable to our grand foe who now triumphs and in th excess of joy sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven so spake th apostate angel though in pain vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair and him thus answered soon his bold compeer o prince o chief of many throned powers that led th embattled seraphim to war under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds fearless endangered heaven perpetual king and put to proof his high supremacy whether upheld by strength or chance or fate too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defeat hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low as far as gods and heavenly essences can perish for the mind and spirit remains invincible and vigour soon returns though all our glory extinct and happy state here swallowed up in endless misery but what if he our conqueror whom i now of force believe almighty since no less than such could have orpowered such force as our have left us this our spirit and strength entire strongly to suffer and support our pains that we may so suffice his vengeful ire or do him mightier service as his thralls by right of war whater his business be here in the heart of hell to work in fire or do his errands in the gloomy deep what can it the avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment whereto with speedy words th archiend replied fallen cherub to be weak is miserable doing or suffering but of this be sure to do aught good never will be our task but ever to do ill our sole delight as being the contrary to his high will whom we resist if then his providence out of our evil seek to bring forth good our labour must be to pervert that end and out of good still to find means of evil which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb his inmost counsels from their destined aim but see the angry victor hath recalled his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm orblown hath laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven received us falling and the thunder winged with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep let us not slip th occasion whether scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild the seat of desolation void of light save what the glimmering of these livid flames casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend from off the tossing of these fiery waves there rest if any rest can harbour there and ressembling our afflicted powers consult how we may henceforth most offend our enemy our own loss how repair how overcome this dire calamity what reinforcement we may gain from hope if not what resolution from despair thus satan talking to his nearest mate with head uplift above the wave and eyes that sparkling blazed his other parts besides prone on the flood extended long and large lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge as whom the fables name of monstrous size titanian or earthorn that warred on jove briareos or typhon whom the den by ancient tarsus held or that seaeast leviathan which god of all his works created hugest that swim th oceantream him haply slumbering on the norway foam the pilot of some small nightoundered skiff deeming some island oft as seamen tell with fixed anchor in his scaly rind moors by his side under the lee while night invests the sea and wished morn delays so stretched out huge in length the archiend lay chained on the burning lake nor ever thence had risen or heaved his head but that the will and high permission of alluling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation while he sought evil to others and enraged might see how all his malice served but to bring forth infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn on man by him seduced but on himself treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature on each hand the flames driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled in billows leave i th midst a horrid vale then with expanded wings he steers his flight aloft incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight till on dry land he lights f it were land that ever burned with solid as the lake with liquid fire and such appeared in hue as when the force of subterranean wind transports a hill torn from pelorus or the shattered side of thundering etna whose combustible and fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds and leave a singed bottom all involved with stench and smoke such resting found the sole of unblest feet him followed his next mate both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood as gods and by their own recovered strength not by the sufferance of supernal power is this the region this the soil the clime said then the lost archangel this the seat that we must change for heaven his mournful gloom for that celestial light be it so since he who now is sovereign can dispose and bid what shall be right farthest from him is best whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme above his equals farewell happy fields where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail infernal world and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor ne who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven what matter where if i be still the same and what i should be all but less than he whom thunder hath made greater here at least we shall be free th almighty hath not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell than serve in heaven but wherefore let we then our faithful friends th associates and coartners of our loss lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool and call them not to share with us their part in this unhappy mansion or once more with rallied arms to try what may be yet regained in heaven or what more lost in hell so satan spake and him beelzebub thus answered leader of those armies bright which but th omnipotent none could have foiled if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge of hope in fears and dangers eard so oft in worst extremes and on the perilous edge of battle when it raged in all assaults their surest signal hey will soon resume new courage and revive though now they lie grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire as we erewhile astounded and amazed no wonder fallen such a pernicious height he scarce had ceased when the superior fiend was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield ethereal temper massy large and round behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb through optic glass the tuscan artist views at evening from the top of fesole or in valdarno to descry new lands rivers or mountains in her spotty globe his spear o equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great ammiral were but a wand he walked with to support uneasy steps over the burning marl not like those steps on heaven azure and the torrid clime smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire nathless he so endured till on the beach of that inflamed sea he stood and called his legions ngel forms who lay entranced thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades high overrched embower or scattered sedge afloat when with fierce winds orion armed hath vexed the redea coast whose waves orthrew busiris and his memphian chivalry while with perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners of goshen who beheld from the safe shore their floating carcases and broken chariotheels so thick bestrown abject and lost lay these covering the flood under amazement of their hideous change he called so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resounded princes potentates warriors the flower of heaven nce yours now lost if such astonishment as this can seize eternal spirits or have ye chosen this place after the toil of battle to repose your wearied virtue for the ease you find to slumber here as in the vales of heaven or in this abject posture have ye sworn to adore the conqueror who now beholds cherub and seraph rolling in the flood with scattered arms and ensigns till anon his swift pursuers from heavenates discern th advantage and descending tread us down thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts transfix us to the bottom of this gulf awake arise or be for ever fallen they heard and were abashed and up they sprung upon the wing as when men wont to watch on duty sleeping found by whom they dread rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake nor did they not perceive the evil plight in which they were or the fierce pains not feel yet to their general voice they soon obeyed innumerable as when the potent rod of amram son in egypt evil day waved round the coast upalled a pitchy cloud of locusts warping on the eastern wind that or the realm of impious pharaoh hung like night and darkened all the land of nile so numberless were those bad angels seen hovering on wing under the cope of hell wixt upper nether and surrounding fires till as a signal given th uplifted spear of their great sultan waving to direct their course in even balance down they light on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain a multitude like which the populous north poured never from her frozen loins to pass rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons came like a deluge on the south and spread beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands forthwith form every squadron and each band the heads and leaders thither haste where stood their great commander odlike shapes and forms excelling human princely dignities and powers that erst in heaven sat on thrones though on their names in heavenly records now be no memorial blotted out and rased by their rebellion from the books of life nor had they yet among the sons of eve got them new names till wandering or the earth through god high sufferance for the trial of man by falsities and lies the greatest part of mankind they corrupted to forsake god their creator and th invisible glory of him that made them to transform oft to the image of a brute adorned with gay religions full of pomp and gold and devils to adore for deities then were they known to men by various names and various idols through the heathen world say muse their names then known who first who last roused from the slumber on that fiery couch at their great emperor call as next in worth came singly where he stood on the bare strand while the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof the chief were those who from the pit of hell roaming to seek their prey on earth durst fix their seats long after next the seat of god their altars by his altar gods adored among the nations round and durst abide jehovah thundering out of sion throned between the cherubim yea often placed within his sanctuary itself their shrines abominations and with cursed things his holy rites and solemn feasts profaned and with their darkness durst affront his light first moloch horrid king besmeared with blood of human sacrifice and parents tears though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud their children cries unheard that passed through fire to his grim idol him the ammonite worshiped in rabba and her watery plain in argob and in basan to the stream of utmost arnon nor content with such audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart of solomon he led by fraud to build his temple right against the temple of god on that opprobrious hill and made his grove the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence and black gehenna called the type of hell next chemos th obscene dread of moab sons from aroar to nebo and the wild of southmost abarim in hesebon and horonaim seon real beyond the flowery dale of sibma clad with vines and eleale to th asphaltic pool peor his other name when he enticed israel in sittim on their march from nile to do him wanton rites which cost them woe yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged even to that hill of scandal by the grove of moloch homicide lust hard by hate till good josiah drove them thence to hell with these came they who from the bordering flood of old euphrates to the brook that parts egypt from syrian ground had general names of baalim and ashtaroth hose male these feminine for spirits when they please can either sex assume or both so soft and uncompounded is their essence pure not tried or manacled with joint or limb nor founded on the brittle strength of bones like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose dilated or condensed bright or obscure can execute their airy purposes and works of love or enmity fulfil for those the race of israel oft forsook their living strength and unfrequented left his righteous altar bowing lowly down to bestial gods for which their heads as low bowed down in battle sunk before the spear of despicable foes with these in troop came astoreth whom the phoenicians called astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns to whose bright image nightly by the moon sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs in sion also not unsung where stood her temple on th offensive mountain built by that uxorious king whose heart though large beguiled by fair idolatresses fell to idols foul thammuz came next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summer day while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded the loveale infected sion daughters with like heat whose wanton passions in the sacred porch ezekiel saw when by the vision led his eye surveyed the dark idolatries of alienated judah next came one who mourned in earnest when the captive ark maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off in his own temple on the grunseldge where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers dagon his name seaonster upward man and downward fish yet had his temple high reared in azotus dreaded through the coast of palestine in gath and ascalon and accaron and gaza frontier bounds him followed rimmon whose delightful seat was fair damascus on the fertile banks of abbana and pharphar lucid streams he also against the house of god was bold a leper once he lost and gained a king ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew god altar to disparage and displace for one of syrian mode whereon to burn his odious offerings and adore the gods whom he had vanquished after these appeared a crew who under names of old renown osiris isis orus and their train with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused fanatic egypt and her priests to seek their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms rather than human nor did israel scape th infection when their borrowed gold composed the calf in oreb and the rebel king doubled that sin in bethel and in dan likening his maker to the grazed ox jehovah who in one night when he passed from egypt marching equalled with one stroke both her firstorn and all her bleating gods belial came last than whom a spirit more lewd fell not from heaven or more gross to love vice for itself to him no temple stood or altar smoked yet who more oft than he in temples and at altars when the priest turns atheist as did eli sons who filled with lust and violence the house of god in courts and palaces he also reigns and in luxurious cities where the noise of riot ascends above their loftiest towers and injury and outrage and when night darkens the streets then wander forth the sons of belial flown with insolence and wine witness the streets of sodom and that night in gibeah when the hospitable door exposed a matron to avoid worse rape these were the prime in order and in might the rest were long to tell though far renowned th ionian gods f javan issue held gods yet confessed later than heaven and earth their boasted parents itan heaven firstorn with his enormous brood and birthright seized by younger saturn he from mightier jove his own and rhea son like measure found so jove usurping reigned these first in crete and ida known thence on the snowy top of cold olympus ruled the middle air their highest heaven or on the delphian cliff or in dodona and through all the bounds of doric land or who with saturn old fled over adria to th hesperian fields and or the celtic roamed the utmost isles all these and more came flocking but with looks downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their chief not in despair to have found themselves not lost in loss itself which on his countenance cast like doubtful hue but he his wonted pride soon recollecting with high words that bore semblance of worth not substance gently raised their fainting courage and dispelled their fears then straight commands that at the warlike sound of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared his mighty standard that proud honour claimed azazel as his right a cherub tall who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled th imperial ensign which full high advanced shone like a meteor streaming to the wind with gems and golden lustre rich emblazed seraphic arms and trophies all the while sonorous metal blowing martial sounds at which the universal host upent a shout that tore hell concave and beyond frighted the reign of chaos and old night all in a moment through the gloom were seen ten thousand banners rise into the air with orient colours waving with them rose a forest huge of spears and thronging helms appeared and serried shields in thick array of depth immeasurable anon they move in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood of flutes and soft recorders uch as raised to height of noblest temper heroes old arming to battle and instead of rage deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved with dread of death to flight or foul retreat nor wanting power to mitigate and swage with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain from mortal or immortal minds thus they breathing united force with fixed thought moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed their painful steps or the burnt soil and now advanced in view they stand horrid front of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise of warriors old with ordered spear and shield awaiting what command their mighty chief had to impose he through the armed files darts his experienced eye and soon traverse the whole battalion views heir order due their visages and stature as of gods their number last he sums and now his heart distends with pride and hardening in his strength glories for never since created man met such embodied force as named with these could merit more than that small infantry warred on by cranes hough all the giant brood of phlegra with th heroic race were joined that fought at thebes and ilium on each side mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds in fable or romance of uther son begirt with british and armoric knights and all who since baptized or infidel jousted in aspramont or montalban damasco or marocco or trebisond or whom biserta sent from afric shore when charlemain with all his peerage fell by fontarabbia thus far these beyond compare of mortal prowess yet observed their dread commander he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower his form had yet not lost all her original brightness nor appeared less than archangel ruined and th excess of glory obscured as when the sun newisen looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone above them all th archangel but his face deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care sat on his faded cheek but under brows of dauntless courage and considerate pride waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast signs of remorse and passion to behold the fellows of his crime the followers rather far other once beheld in blis condemned for ever now to have their lot in pain millions of spirits for his fault amerced of heaven and from eternal splendours flung for his revolt et faithful how they stood their glory withered as when heaven fire hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines with singed top their stately growth though bare stands on the blasted heath he now prepared to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend from wing to wing and half enclose him round with all his peers attention held them mute thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn tears such as angels weep burst forth at last words interwove with sighs found out their way o myriads of immortal spirits o powers matchless but with th almighty nd that strife was not inglorious though th event was dire as this place testifies and this dire change hateful to utter but what power of mind forseeing or presaging from the depth of knowledge past or present could have feared how such united force of gods how such as stood like these could ever know repulse for who can yet believe though after loss that all these puissant legions whose exile hath emptied heaven shall fail to rescend selfaised and repossess their native seat for me be witness all the host of heaven if counsels different or danger shunned by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne upheld by old repute consent or custom and his regal state put forth at full but still his strength concealed which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall henceforth his might we know and know our own so as not either to provoke or dread new war provoked our better part remains to work in close design by fraud or guile what force effected not that he no less at length from us may find who overcomes by force hath overcome but half his foe space may produce new worlds whereof so rife there went a fame in heaven that he ere long intended to create and therein plant a generation whom his choice regard should favour equal to the sons of heaven thither if but to pry shall be perhaps our first eruption hither or elsewhere for this infernal pit shall never hold celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss long under darkness cover but these thoughts full counsel must mature peace is despaired for who can think submission war then war open or understood must be resolved he spake and to confirm his words outflew millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze far round illumined hell highly they raged against the highest and fierce with grasped arms clashed on their sounding shields the din of war hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven there stood a hill not far whose grisly top belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire shone with a glossy scurf ndoubted sign that in his womb was hid metallic ore the work of sulphur thither winged with speed a numerous brigade hastened as when bands of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed forerun the royal camp to trench a field or cast a rampart mammon led them on mammon the least erected spirit that fell from heaven for even in heaven his looks and thoughts were always downward bent admiring more the riches of heaven pavement trodden gold than aught divine or holy else enjoyed in vision beatific by him first men also and by his suggestion taught ransacked the centre and with impious hands rifled the bowels of their mother earth for treasures better hid soon had his crew opened into the hill a spacious wound and digged out ribs of gold let none admire that riches grow in hell that soil may best deserve the precious bane and here let those who boast in mortal things and wondering tell of babel and the works of memphian kings learn how their greatest monuments of fame and strength and art are easily outdone by spirits reprobate and in an hour what in an age they with incessant toil and hands innumerable scarce perform nigh on the plain in many cells prepared that underneath had veins of liquid fire sluiced from the lake a second multitude with wondrous art founded the massy ore severing each kind and scummed the bullionross a third as soon had formed within the ground a various mould and from the boiling cells by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook as in an organ from one blast of wind to many a row of pipes the soundoard breathes anon out of the earth a fabric huge rose like an exhalation with the sound of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet built like a temple where pilasters round were set and doric pillars overlaid with golden architrave nor did there want cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven the roof was fretted gold not babylon nor great alcairo such magnificence equalled in all their glories to enshrine belus or serapis their gods or seat their kings when egypt with assyria strove in wealth and luxury th ascending pile stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors opening their brazen folds discover wide within her ample spaces or the smooth and level pavement from the arched roof pendent by subtle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naptha and asphaltus yielded light as from a sky the hasty multitude admiring entered and the work some praise and some the architect his hand was known in heaven by many a towered structure high where sceptred angels held their residence and sat as princes whom the supreme king exalted to such power and gave to rule each in his hierarchy the orders bright nor was his name unheard or unadored in ancient greece and in ausonian land men called him mulciber and how he fell from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove sheer or the crystal battlements from morn to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve a summer day and with the setting sun dropt from the zenith like a falling star on lemnos th aegaean isle thus they relate erring for he with this rebellious rout fell long before nor aught availed him now to have built in heaven high towers nor did he scape by all his engines but was headlong sent with his industrious crew to build in hell meanwhile the winged heralds by command of sovereign power with awful ceremony and trumpet sound throughout the host proclaim a solemn council forthwith to be held at pandemonium the high capital of satan and his peers their summons called from every band and squared regiment by place or choice the worthiest they anon with hundreds and with thousands trooping came attended all access was thronged the gates and porches wide but chief the spacious hall though like a covered field where champions bold wont ride in armed and at the soldan chair defied the best of paynim chivalry to mortal combat or career with lanc thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air brushed with the hiss of rustling wings as bees in springime when the sun with taurus rides pour forth their populous youth about the hive in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank the suburb of their strawuilt citadel new rubbed with balm expatiate and confer their stateffairs so thick the airy crowd swarmed and were straitened till the signal given behold a wonder they but now who seemed in bigness to surpass earth giant sons now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room throng numberless ike that pygmean race beyond the indian mount or faery elves whose midnight revels by a forestide or fountain some belated peasant sees or dreams he sees while overhead the moon sits arbitress and nearer to the earth wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance intent with jocund music charm his ear at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large though without number still amidst the hall of that infernal court but far within and in their own dimensions like themselves the great seraphic lords and cherubim in close recess and secret conclave sat a thousand demiods on golden seats frequent and full after short silence then and summons read the great consult began book high on a throne of royal state which far outshone the wealth of ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit raised to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires beyond thus high insatiate to pursue vain war with heaven and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displayed powers and dominions deities of heaven for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen i give not heaven for lost from this descent celestial virtues rising will appear more glorious and more dread than from no fall and trust themselves to fear no second fate me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven did first create your leader ext free choice with what besides in council or in fight hath been achieved of merit et this loss thus far at least recovered hath much more established in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent the happier state in heaven which follows dignity might draw envy from each inferior but who here will envy whom the highest place exposes foremost to stand against the thunderer aim your bulwark and condemns to greatest share of endless pain where there is then no good for which to strive no strife can grow up there from faction for none sure will claim in hell precedence none whose portion is so small of present pain that with ambitious mind will covet more with this advantage then to union and firm faith and firm accord more than can be in heaven we now return to claim our just inheritance of old surer to prosper than prosperity could have assured us and by what best way whether of open war or covert guile we now debate who can advise may speak he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king stood up he strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair his trust was with th eternal to be deemed equal in strength and rather than be less cared not to be at all with that care lost went all his fear of god or hell or worse he recked not and these words thereafter spake my sentence is for open war of wiles more unexpert i boast not them let those contrive who need or when they need not now for while they sit contriving shall the rest millions that stand in arms and longing wait the signal to ascend it lingering here heaven fugitives and for their dwellinglace accept this dark opprobrious den of shame the prison of his tyranny who reigns by our delay no let us rather choose armed with helllames and fury all at once or heaven high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne itself mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments but perhaps the way seems difficult and steep to scale with upright wing against a higher foe let such bethink them if the sleepy drench of that forgetful lake benumb not still that in our proper motion we ascend up to our native seat descent and fall to us is adverse who but felt of late when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear insulting and pursued us through the deep with what compulsion and laborious flight we sunk thus low th ascent is easy then th event is feared should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned in this abhorred deep to utter woe where pain of unextinguishable fire must exercise us without hope of end the vassals of his anger when the scourge inexorably and the torturing hour calls us to penance more destroyed than thus we should be quite abolished and expire what fear we then what doubt we to incense his utmost ire which to the height enraged will either quite consume us and reduce to nothing this essential appier far than miserable to have eternal being or if our substance be indeed divine and cannot cease to be we are at worst on this side nothing and by proof we feel our power sufficient to disturb his heaven and with perpetual inroads to alarm though inaccessible his fatal throne which if not victory is yet revenge he ended frowning and his look denounced desperate revenge and battle dangerous to less than gods on th other side up rose belial in act more graceful and humane a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed for dignity composed and high exploit but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear and with persuasive accent thus began i should be much for open war o peers as not behind in hate if what was urged main reason to persuade immediate war did not dissuade me most and seem to cast ominous conjecture on the whole success when he who most excels in fact of arms in what he counsels and in what excels mistrustful grounds his courage on despair and utter dissolution as the scope of all his aim after some dire revenge first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled with armed watch that render all access impregnable oft on the bordering deep encamp their legions or with obscure wing scout far and wide into the realm of night scorning surprise or could we break our way by force and at our heels all hell should rise with blackest insurrection to confound heaven purest light yet our great enemy all incorruptible would on his throne sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould incapable of stain would soon expel her mischief and purge off the baser fire victorious thus repulsed our final hope is flat despair we must exasperate th almighty victor to spend all his rage and that must end us that must be our cure to be no more sad cure for who would lose though full of pain this intellectual being those thoughts that wander through eternity to perish rather swallowed up and lost in the wide womb of uncreated night devoid of sense and motion and who knows let this be good whether our angry foe can give it or will ever how he can is doubtful that he never will is sure will he so wise let loose at once his ire belike through impotence or unaware to give his enemies their wish and end them in his anger whom his anger saves to punish endless wherefore cease we then say they who counsel war we are decreed reserved and destined to eternal woe whatever doing what can we suffer more what can we suffer worse is this then worst thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms what when we fled amain pursued and struck with heaven afflicting thunder and besought the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed a refuge from those wounds or when we lay chained on the burning lake that sure was worse what if the breath that kindled those grim fires awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage and plunge us in the flames or from above should intermitted vengeance arm again his red right hand to plague us what if all her stores were opened and this firmament of hell should spout her cataracts of fire impendent horrors threatening hideous fall one day upon our heads while we perhaps designing or exhorting glorious war caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains there to converse with everlasting groans unrespited unpitied unreprieved ages of hopeless end this would be worse war therefore open or concealed alike my voice dissuades for what can force or guile with him or who deceive his mind whose eye views all things at one view he from heaven height all these our motions vain sees and derides not more almighty to resist our might than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles shall we then live thus vile he race of heaven thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here chains and these torments better these than worse by my advice since fate inevitable subdues us and omnipotent decree the victor will to suffer as to do our strength is equal nor the law unjust that so ordains this was at first resolved if we were wise against so great a foe contending and so doubtful what might fall i laugh when those who at the spear are bold and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear what yet they know must follow o endure exile or ignominy or bonds or pain the sentence of their conqueror this is now our doom which if we can sustain and bear our supreme foe in time may much remit his anger and perhaps thus far removed not mind us not offending satisfied with what is punished whence these raging fires will slacken if his breath stir not their flames our purer essence then will overcome their noxious vapour or inured not feel or changed at length and to the place conformed in temper and in nature will receive familiar the fierce heat and void of pain this horror will grow mild this darkness light besides what hope the nevernding flight of future days may bring what chance what change worth waiting ince our present lot appears for happy though but ill for ill not worst if we procure not to ourselves more woe thus belial with words clothed in reason garb counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth not peace and after him thus mammon spake either to disenthrone the king of heaven we war if war be best or to regain our own right lost him to unthrone we then may hope when everlasting fate shall yield to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife the former vain to hope argues as vain the latter for what place can be for us within heaven bound unless heaven lord supreme we overpower suppose he should relent and publish grace to all on promise made of new subjection with what eyes could we stand in his presence humble and receive strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits our envied sovereign and his altar breathes ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers our servile offerings this must be our task in heaven this our delight how wearisome eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate let us not then pursue by force impossible by leave obtained unacceptable though in heaven our state of splendid vassalage but rather seek our own good from ourselves and from our own live to ourselves though in this vast recess free and to none accountable preferring hard liberty before the easy yoke of servile pomp our greatness will appear then most conspicuous when great things of small useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse we can create and in what place soer thrive under evil and work ease out of pain through labour and endurance this deep world of darkness do we dread how oft amidst thick clouds and dark doth heaven alluling sire choose to reside his glory unobscured and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell as he our darkness cannot we his light imitate when we please this desert soil wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heaven show more our torments also may in length of time become our elements these piercing fires as soft as now severe our temper changed into their temper which must needs remove the sensible of pain all things invite to peaceful counsels and the settled state of order how in safety best we may compose our present evils with regard of what we are and where dismissing quite all thoughts of war ye have what i advise he scarce had finished when such murmur filled th assembly as when hollow rocks retain the sound of blustering winds which all night long had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull seafaring men orwatched whose bark by chance or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay after the tempest such applause was heard as mammon ended and his sentence pleased advising peace for such another field they dreaded worse than hell so much the fear of thunder and the sword of michael wrought still within them and no less desire to found this nether empire which might rise by policy and long process of time in emulation opposite to heaven which when beelzebub perceived han whom satan except none higher sat ith grave aspect he rose and in his rising seemed a pillar of state deep on his front engraven deliberation sat and public care and princely counsel in his face yet shone majestic though in ruin sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies his look drew audience and attention still as night or summer noontide air while thus he spake thrones and imperial powers offspring of heaven ethereal virtues or these titles now must we renounce and changing style be called princes of hell for so the popular vote inclines ere to continue and build up here a growing empire doubtless while we dream and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed this place our dungeon not our safe retreat beyond his potent arm to live exempt from heaven high jurisdiction in new league banded against his throne but to remain in strictest bondage though thus far removed under th inevitable curb reserved his captive multitude for he to be sure in height or depth still first and last will reign sole king and of his kingdom lose no part by our revolt but over hell extend his empire and with iron sceptre rule us here as with his golden those in heaven what sit we then projecting peace and war war hath determined us and foiled with loss irreparable terms of peace yet none vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given to us enslaved but custody severe and stripes and arbitrary punishment inflicted and what peace can we return but to our power hostility and hate untamed reluctance and revenge though slow yet ever plotting how the conqueror least may reap his conquest and may least rejoice in doing what we most in suffering feel nor will occasion want nor shall we need with dangerous expedition to invade heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege or ambush from the deep what if we find some easier enterprise there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven err no nother world the happy seat of some new race called man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favoured more of him who rules above so was his will pronounced among the gods and by an oath that shook heaven whole circumference confirmed thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn what creatures there inhabit of what mould or substance how endued and what their power and where their weakness how attempted best by force of subtlety though heaven be shut and heaven high arbitrator sit secure in his own strength this place may lie exposed the utmost border of his kingdom left to their defence who hold it here perhaps some advantageous act may be achieved by sudden onset ither with hellire to waste his whole creation or possess all as our own and drive as we were driven the puny habitants or if not drive seduce them to our party that their god may prove their foe and with repenting hand abolish his own works this would surpass common revenge and interrupt his joy in our confusion and our joy upraise in his disturbance when his darling sons hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse their frail original and faded bliss faded so soon advise if this be worth attempting or to sit in darkness here hatching vain empires thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel irst devised by satan and in part proposed for whence but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice to confound the race of mankind in one root and earth with hell to mingle and involve done all to spite the great creator but their spite still serves his glory to augment the bold design pleased highly those infernal states and joy sparkled in all their eyes with full assent they vote whereat his speech he thus renews well have ye judged well ended long debate synod of gods and like to what ye are great things resolved which from the lowest deep will once more lift us up in spite of fate nearer our ancient seat erhaps in view of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms and opportune excursion we may chance renter heaven or else in some mild zone dwell not unvisited of heaven fair light secure and at the brightening orient beam purge off this gloom the soft delicious air to heal the scar of these corrosive fires shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send in search of this new world whom shall we find sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomed infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his airy flight upborne with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt ere he arrive the happy isle what strength what art can then suffice or what evasion bear him safe through the strict senteries and stations thick of angels watching round here he had need all circumspection and we now no less choice in our suffrage for on whom we send the weight of all and our last hope relies this said he sat and expectation held his look suspense awaiting who appeared to second or oppose or undertake the perilous attempt but all sat mute pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each in other countenance read his own dismay astonished none among the choice and prime of those heavenarring champions could be found so hardy as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage till at last satan whom now transcendent glory raised above his fellows with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake o progeny of heaven empyreal thrones with reason hath deep silence and demur seized us though undismayed long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light our prison strong this huge convex of fire outrageous to devour immures us round ninefold and gates of burning adamant barred over us prohibit all egress these passed if any pass the void profound of unessential night receives him next wideaping and with utter loss of being threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf if thence he scape into whatever world or unknown region what remains him less than unknown dangers and as hard escape but i should ill become this throne o peers and this imperial sovereignty adorned with splendour armed with power if aught proposed and judged of public moment in the shape of difficulty or danger could deter me from attempting wherefore do i assume these royalties and not refuse to reign refusing to accept as great a share of hazard as of honour due alike to him who reigns and so much to him due of hazard more as he above the rest high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers terror of heaven though fallen intend at home while here shall be our home what best may ease the present misery and render hell more tolerable if there be cure or charm to respite or deceive or slack the pain of this ill mansion intermit no watch against a wakeful foe while i abroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek deliverance for us all this enterprise none shall partake with me thus saying rose the monarch and prevented all reply prudent lest from his resolution raised others among the chief might offer now certain to be refused what erst they feared and so refused might in opinion stand his rivals winning cheap the high repute which he through hazard huge must earn but they dreaded not more th adventure than his voice forbidding and at once with him they rose their rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote towards him they bend with awful reverence prone and as a god extol him equal to the highest in heaven nor failed they to express how much they praised that for the general safety he despised his own for neither do the spirits damned lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast their specious deeds on earth which glory excites or close ambition varnished or with zeal thus they their doubtful consultations dark ended rejoicing in their matchless chief as when from mountainops the dusky clouds ascending while the north wind sleeps orspread heaven cheerful face the louring element scowls or the darkened landscape snow or shower if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet extend his evening beam the fields revive the birds their notes renew and bleating herds attest their joy that hill and valley rings o shame to men devil with devil damned firm concord holds men only disagree of creatures rational though under hope of heavenly grace and god proclaiming peace yet live in hatred enmity and strife among themselves and levy cruel wars wasting the earth each other to destroy as if which might induce us to accor man had not hellish foes enow besides that day and night for his destruction wait the stygian council thus dissolved and forth in order came the grand infernal peers midst came their mighty paramount and seemed alone th antagonist of heaven nor less than hell dread emperor with pomp supreme and godike imitated state him round a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed with bright emblazonry and horrent arms then of their session ended they bid cry with trumpet regal sound the great result toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to their mouths the sounding alchemy by herald voice explained the hollow abyss heard far and wide and all the host of hell with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised by false presumptuous hope the ranged powers disband and wandering each his several way pursues as inclination or sad choice leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find truce to his restless thoughts and entertain the irksome hours till his great chief return part on the plain or in the air sublime upon the wing or in swift race contend as at th olympian games or pythian fields part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form as when to warn proud cities war appears waged in the troubled sky and armies rush to battle in the clouds before each van prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears till thickest legions close with feats of arms from either end of heaven the welkin burns others with vast typhoean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar as when alcides from oechalia crowned with conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore through pain up by the roots thessalian pines and lichas from the top of oeta threw into th euboic sea others more mild retreated in a silent valley sing with notes angelical to many a harp their own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battle and complain that fate free virtue should enthrall to force or chance their song was partial but the harmony what could it less when spirits immortal sing suspended hell and took with ravishment the thronging audience in discourse more sweet for eloquence the soul song charms the sens others apart sat on a hill retired in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high of providence foreknowledge will and fate fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandering mazes lost of good and evil much they argued then of happiness and final misery passion and apathy and glory and shame vain wisdom all and false philosophy yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm pain for a while or anguish and excite fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel another part in squadrons and gross bands on bold adventure to discover wide that dismal world if any clime perhaps might yield them easier habitation bend four ways their flying march along the banks of four infernal rivers that disgorge into the burning lake their baleful streams abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate sad acheron of sorrow black and deep cocytus named of lamentation loud heard on the rueful stream fierce phlegeton whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage far off from these a slow and silent stream lethe the river of oblivion rolls her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks forthwith his former state and being forgets forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain beyond this flood a frozen continent lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice a gulf profound as that serbonian bog betwixt damiata and mount casius old where armies whole have sunk the parching air burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire thither by harpyooted furies haled at certain revolutions all the damned are brought and feel by turns the bitter change of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce from beds of raging fire to starve in ice their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine immovable infixed and frozen round periods of time hence hurried back to fire they ferry over this lethean sound both to and fro their sorrow to augment and wish and struggle as they pass to reach the tempting stream with one small drop to lose in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe all in one moment and so near the brink but fate withstands and to oppose th attempt medusa with gorgonian terror guards the ford and of itself the water flies all taste of living wight as once it fled the lip of tantalus thus roving on in confused march forlorn th adventurous bands with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast viewed first their lamentable lot and found no rest through many a dark and dreary vale they passed and many a region dolorous or many a frozen many a fiery alp rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death a universe of death which god by curse created evil for evil only good where all life dies death lives and nature breeds perverse all monstrous all prodigious things obominable inutterable and worse than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire meanwhile the adversary of god and man satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design puts on swift wings and toward the gates of hell explores his solitary flight sometimes he scours the right hand coast sometimes the left now shaves with level wing the deep then soars up to the fiery concave towering high as when far off at sea a fleet descried hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds close sailing from bengala or the isles of ternate and tidore whence merchants bring their spicy drugs they on the trading flood through the wide ethiopian to the cape ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed far off the flying fiend at last appear hellounds high reaching to the horrid roof and thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass three iron three of adamantine rock impenetrable impaled with circling fire yet unconsumed before the gates there sat on either side a formidable shape the one seemed woman to the waist and fair but ended foul in many a scaly fold voluminous and vast serpent armed with mortal sting about her middle round a cry of hellounds nevereasing barked with wide cerberean mouths full loud and rung a hideous peal yet when they list would creep if aught disturbed their noise into her womb and kennel there yet there still barked and howled within unseen far less abhorred than these vexed scylla bathing in the sea that parts calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore nor uglier follow the nightag when called in secret riding through the air she comes lured with the smell of infant blood to dance with lapland witches while the labouring moon eclipses at their charms the other shape if shape it might be called that shape had none distinguishable in member joint or limb or substance might be called that shadow seemed for each seemed either lack it stood as night fierce as ten furies terrible as hell and shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on satan was now at hand and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode th undaunted fiend what this might be admired admired not feared god and his son except created thing naught valued he nor shunne and with disdainful look thus first began whence and what art thou execrable shape that dart though grim and terrible advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates through them i mean to pass that be assured without leave asked of thee retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof hellorn not to contend with spirits of heaven to whom the goblin full of wrath replied art thou that traitor angel art thou he who first broke peace in heaven and faith till then unbroken and in proud rebellious arms drew after him the third part of heaven sons conjured against the highest or which both thou and they outcast from god are here condemned to waste eternal days in woe and pain and reckont thou thyself with spirits of heaven helloomed and breatht defiance here and scorn where i reign king and to enrage thee more thy king and lord back to thy punishment false fugitive and to thy speed add wings lest with a whip of scorpions i pursue thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before so spake the grisly terror and in shape so speaking and so threatening grew tenfold more dreadful and deform on th other side incensed with indignation satan stood unterrified and like a comet burned that fires the length of ophiuchus huge in th arctic sky and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and war each at the head levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands no second stroke intend and such a frown each cast at th other as when two black clouds with heaven artillery fraught came rattling on over the caspian hen stand front to front hovering a space till winds the signal blow to join their dark encounter in midir so frowned the mighty combatants that hell grew darker at their frown so matched they stood for never but once more was wither like to meet so great a foe and now great deeds had been achieved whereof all hell had rung had not the snaky sorceress that sat fast by hellate and kept the fatal key risen and with hideous outcry rushed between o father what intends thy hand she cried against thy only son what fury o son possesses thee to bend that mortal dart against thy father head and knowt for whom for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordained his drudge to execute whater his wrath which he calls justice bids his wrath which one day will destroy ye both she spake and at her words the hellish pest forbore then these to her satan returned so strange thy outcry and thy words so strange thou interposest that my sudden hand prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds what it intends till first i know of thee what thing thou art thus doubleormed and why in this infernal vale first met thou callt me father and that phantasm callt my son i know thee not nor ever saw till now sight more detestable than him and thee t whom thus the portress of hellate replied hast thou forgot me then and do i seem now in thine eye so foul nce deemed so fair in heaven when at th assembly and in sight of all the seraphim with thee combined in bold conspiracy against heaven king all on a sudden miserable pain surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum in darkness while thy head flames thick and fast threw forth till on the left side opening wide likest to thee in shape and countenance bright then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed out of thy head i sprung amazement seized all th host of heaven back they recoiled afraid at first and called me sin and for a sign portentous held me but familiar grown i pleased and with attractive graces won the most averse hee chiefly who full oft thyself in me thy perfect image viewing becamt enamoured and such joy thou tookt with me in secret that my womb conceived a growing burden meanwhile war arose and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained for what could else to our almighty foe clear victory to our part loss and rout through all the empyrean down they fell driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down into this deep and in the general fall i also at which time this powerful key into my hands was given with charge to keep these gates for ever shut which none can pass without my opening pensive here i sat alone but long i sat not till my womb pregnant by thee and now excessive grown prodigious motion felt and rueful throes at last this odious offspring whom thou seest thine own begotten breaking violent way tore through my entrails that with fear and pain distorted all my nether shape thus grew transformed but he my inbred enemy forth issued brandishing his fatal dart made to destroy i fled and cried out death hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed from all her caves and back resounded death i fled but he pursued though more it seems inflamed with lust than rag and swifter far me overtook his mother all dismayed and in embraces forcible and foul engendering with me of that rape begot these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry surround me as thou sawt ourly conceived and hourly born with sorrow infinite to me for when they list into the womb that bred them they return and howl and gnaw my bowels their repast then bursting forth afresh with conscious terrors vex me round that rest or intermission none i find before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death my son and foe who set them on and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey but that he knows his end with mine involved and knows that i should prove a bitter morsel and his bane whenever that shall be so fate pronounced but thou o father i forewarn thee shun his deadly arrow neither vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint save he who reigns above none can resist she finished and the subtle fiend his lore soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth dear daughter ince thou claimt me for thy sire and my fair son here showt me the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys then sweet now sad to mention through dire change befallen us unforeseen unthoughtf now i come no enemy but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain both him and thee and all the heavenly host of spirits that in our just pretences armed fell with us from on high from them i go this uncouth errand sole and one for all myself expose with lonely steps to tread th unfounded deep and through the void immense to search with wandering quest a place foretold should be nd by concurring signs ere now created vast and round place of bliss in the purlieus of heaven and therein placed a race of upstart creatures to supply perhaps our vacant room though more removed lest heaven surcharged with potent multitude might hap to move new broils be this or aught than this more secret now designed i haste to know and this once known shall soon return and bring ye to the place where thou and death shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen wing silently the buxom air embalmed with odours there ye shall be fed and filled immeasurably all things shall be your prey he ceased for both seemed highly pleased and death grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear his famine should be filled and blessed his maw destined to that good hour no less rejoiced his mother bad and thus bespake her sire the key of this infernal pit by due and by command of heaven allowerful king i keep by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart fearless to be ormatched by living might but what owe i to his commands above who hates me and hath hither thrust me down into this gloom of tartarus profound to sit in hateful office here confined inhabitant of heaven and heavenly born here in perpetual agony and pain with terrors and with clamours compassed round of mine own brood that on my bowels feed thou art my father thou my author thou my being gavt me whom should i obey but thee whom follow thou wilt bring me soon to that new world of light and bliss among the gods who live at ease where i shall reign at thy right hand voluptuous as beseems thy daughter and thy darling without end thus saying from her side the fatal key sad instrument of all our woe she took and towards the gate rolling her bestial train forthwith the huge portcullis high uprew which but herself not all the stygian powers could once have moved then

ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots ranked in loose array so wide they stood and like a furnaceouth cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame before their eyes in sudden view

hold eternal anarchy amidst the noise of endless wars and by confusion stand for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce strive here for mastery and to battle bring their embryon atoms they

unless th almighty maker them ordain his dark materials to create more worlds into this wild abyss the wary fiend stood on the brink of hell and looked a while pondering his voyage for no narrow frith he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed with noises loud and ruinous to compare great things with smal than when bellona storms with all her battering engines bent to rase some capital city or less than if this frame of heaven were falling and these elements in mutiny had from her axle torn the steadfast earth at last his sailroad vans he spread for flight and in the surging smoke uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league as in a cloudy chair ascending rides audacious but that seat soon failing meets a vast vacuity all unawares fluttering his pennons vain plumbown he drops ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour down had been falling had not by ill chance the strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and nitre hurried him as many miles aloft that fury stayed quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea nor good dry land igh foundered on he fares treading the crude consistence half on foot half flying behoves him now both oar and sail as when a gryphon through the wilderness with winged course or hill or moory dale pursues the arimaspian who by stealth had from his wakeful custody purloined the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend or bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare with head hands wings or feet pursues his way and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies at length a universal hubbub wild of stunning sounds and voices all confused borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear with loudest vehemence thither he plies undaunted to meet there whatever power or spirit of the nethermost abyss might in that noise reside of whom to ask which way the nearest coast of darkness lies bordering on light when straight behold the throne of chaos and his dark pavilion spread wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned sat sableested night eldest of things the consort of his reign and by them stood orcus and ades and the dreaded name of demogorgon rumour next and chance and tumult and confusion all embroiled and discord with a thousand various mouths t whom satan turning boldly thus ye powers and spirits of this nethermost abyss chaos and ancient night i come no spy with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm but by constraint wandering this darksome desert as my way lies through your spacious empire up to light alone and without guide half lost i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds confine with heaven or if some other place from your dominion won th ethereal king possesses lately thither to arrive i travel this profound direct my course directed no mean recompense it brings to your behoof if i that region lost all usurpation thence expelled reduce to her original darkness and your sway which is my present journe and once more erect the standard there of ancient

who of late made head against heaven king though overthrown i saw and heard for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin rout on rout confusion worse confounded and heavenates poured out by millions her victorious bands pursuing i upon my frontiers here keep residence if all i can will serve that little which is left so to defend encroached on

golden chain to that side heaven from whence your legions fell if that way be your walk you have not far so much the nearer danger go and speed havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain he ceased and satan stayed not to reply but glad that now his sea should find a shore with fresh alacrity and force renewed springs upward like a pyramid of fire into the wild expanse and through the shock of fighting elements on all sides round environed wins his way harder beset and more endangered than when argo passed through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks or when ulysses on the larboard shunned charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered so he with difficulty and labour hard moved on with difficulty and labour he but he once passed soon after when man fell strange alteration sin and death amain following his track such was the will of heave paved after him a broad and beaten way over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length from hell continued reaching th utmost orb of this frail world by which the spirits perverse with easy intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals except whom god and good angels guard by special grace but now at last the sacred influence of light appears and from the walls of heaven shoots far into the bosom of dim night a glimmering dawn here nature first begins her farthest verge and chaos to retire as from her outmost works a broken foe with tumult less and with less hostile din that satan with less toil and now with ease wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light and like a weathereaten vessel holds gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn or in the emptier waste resembling air weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold far off th empyreal heaven extended wide in circuit undetermined square or round with opal towers and battlements adorned of living sapphire once his native seat and fast by hanging in a golden chain this pendent world in bigness as a star of smallest magnitude close by the moon thither full fraught with mischievous revenge accursed and in a cursed hour he hies book hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn or of the eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblam

revisitt not these eyes that roll in vain to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn so thick a drop serene hath quench their orbs or dim suffusion veil yet not the more cease i to wander where the muses haunt clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill smit with the love of sacred song but chief thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath that wash thy hallow feet and warbling flow nightly i visit

the pure empyrean where he sits high thron above all highth bent down his eye his own works and their works at once to view about him all the sanctities of heaven stood thick as stars and from his sight receiv beatitude past utterance on his right the radiant image of his glory sat his only son on earth he first beheld our two first parents yet the only two of mankind in the happy garden plac reaping immortal fruits of joy and love uninterrupted joy unrivall love in blissful solitude he then survey hell and the gulf between and satan there coasting the wall of heaven on this side night in the dun air sublime and ready now to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet on the bare outside of this world that seem firm land imbosom without firmament uncertain which in ocean or in air him god beholding from his prospect high wherein past present future he beholds thus to his only son foreseeing spake only begotten son seest thou what rage transports our adversary whom no bounds prescrib no bars of hell nor all the chains heap on him there nor yet the main abyss wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems on desperate revenge that shall redound upon his own rebellious head and now through all restraint broke loose he wings his way not far off heaven in the precincts of light directly towards the new created world and man there plac with purpose to assay if him by force he can destroy or worse by some false guile pervert and shall pervert for man will hearken to his glozing lies and easily transgress the sole command sole pledge of his obedience so will fall he and his faithless progeny whose fault whose but his own ingrate he had of me all he could have i made him just and right sufficient to have stood though free to fall such i created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who fail freely they stood who stood and fell who fell not free what proof could they have given sincere of true allegiance constant faith or love where only what they needs must do appear not what they would what praise could they receive what pleasure i from such obedience paid when will and reason reason also is choic useless and vain of freedom both despoil made passive both had serv necessity not me they therefore as to right belong so were created nor can justly accuse their maker or their making or their fate as if predestination overul their will dispos by absolute decree or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed their own revolt not i if i foreknew foreknowledge had no influence on their fault which had no less proved certain unforeknown so without least impulse or shadow of fate or aught by me immutably foreseen they trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for so i form them free and free they must remain till they enthrall themselves i else must change their nature and revoke the high decree unchangeable eternal which ordain their freedom they themselves ordain their fall the first sort by their own suggestion fell selfempted selfeprav man falls deceiv by the other first man therefore shall find grace the other none in mercy and justice both through heaven and earth so shall my glory excel but mercy first and last shall brightest shine thus while god spake ambrosial fragrance fill all heaven and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffus beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious in him all his father shone substantially express and in his face divine compassion visibly appear love without end and without measure grace which uttering thus he to his father spake o father gracious was that word which clos thy sovran command that man should find grace for which both heaven and earth shall high extol thy praises with the innumerable sound of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne encompass shall resound thee ever blest for should man finally be lost should man thy creature late so lov thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud though join with his own folly that be from thee far that far be from thee father who art judge of all things made and judgest only right or shall the adversary thus obtain his end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill his malice and thy goodness bring to nought or proud return though to his heavier doom yet with revenge accomplish and to hell draw after him the whole race of mankind by him corrupted or wilt thou thyself abolish thy creation and unmake for him what for thy glory thou hast made so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be question and blasphem without defence to whom the great creator thus replied o son in whom my soul hath chief delight son of my bosom son who art alone my word my wisdom and effectual might all hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all as my eternal purpose hath decreed man shall not quite be lost but sav who will yet not of will in him but grace in me freely vouchsaf once more i will renew his lapsed powers though forfeit and enthrall by sin to foul exorbitant desires upheld by me yet once more he shall stand on even ground against his mortal foe by me upheld that he may know how frail his fallen condition is and to me owe all his deliverance and to none but me some i have chosen of peculiar grace elect above the rest so is my will the rest shall hear me call and oft be warn their sinful state and to appease betimes the incensed deity while offer grace invites for i will clear their senses dark what may suffice and soften stony hearts to pray repent and bring obedience due to prayer repentance and obedience due though but endeavour with sincere intent mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut and i will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience whom if they will hear light after light well us they shall attain and to the end persisting safe arrive this my long sufferance and my day of grace they who neglect and scorn shall never taste but hard be harden blind be blinded more that they may stumble on and deeper fall and none but such from mercy i exclude but yet all is not done man disobeying disloyal breaks his fealty and sins against the high supremacy of heaven affecting godead and so losing all to expiate his treason hath nought left but to destruction sacred and devote he with his whole posterity must die die he or justice must unless for him some other able and as willing pay the rigid satisfaction death for death say heavenly powers where shall we find such love which of you will be mortal to redeem man mortal crime and just the unjust to save dwells in all heaven charity so dear he ask but all the heavenly quire stood mute and silence was in heaven on man behalf patron or intercessour none appear much less that durst upon his own head draw the deadly forfeiture and ransom set and now without redemption all mankind must have been lost adjudg to death and hell by doom severe had not the son of god in whom the fulness dwells of love divine his dearest mediation thus renew father thy word is past man shall find grace and shall grace not find means that finds her way the speediest of thy winged messengers to visit all thy creatures and to all comes unprevented unimplor unsought happy for man so coming he her aid can never seek once dead in sins and lost atonement for himself or offering meet indebted and undone hath none to bring behold me then me for him life for life i offer on me let thine anger fall account me man i for his sake will leave thy bosom and this glory next to thee freely put off and for him lastly die well pleased on me let death wreak all his rage under his gloomy power i shall not long lie vanquished thou hast given me to possess life in myself for ever by thee i live though now to death i yield and am his due all that of me can die yet that debt paid thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave his prey nor suffer my unspotted soul for ever with corruption there to dwell but i shall rise victorious and subdue my vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil death his death wound shall then receive and stoop inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed i through the ample air in triumph high shall lead hell captive maugre hell and show the powers of darkness bound thou at the sight pleased out of heaven shalt look down and smile while by thee raised i ruin all my foes death last and with his carcase glut the grave then with the multitude of my redeemed shall enter heaven long absent and return father to see thy face wherein no cloud of anger shall remain but peace assured and reconcilement wrath shall be no more thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire his words here ended but his meek aspect silent yet spake and breathed immortal love to mortal men above which only shone filial obedience as a sacrifice glad to be offered he attends the will of his great father admiration seized all heaven what this might mean and whither tend wondering but soon th almighty thus replied o thou in heaven and earth the only peace found out for mankind under wrath o thou my sole complacence well thou knowt how dear to me are all my works nor man the least though last created that for him i spare thee from my bosom and right hand to save by losing thee a while the whole race lost thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem their nature also to thy nature join and be thyself man among men on earth made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed by wondrous birth be thou in adam room the head of all mankind though adam son as in him perish all men so in thee as from a second root shall be restored as many as are restored without thee none his crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit imputed shall absolve them who renounce their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds and live in thee transplanted and from thee receive new life so man as is most just shall satisfy for man be judged and die and dying rise and rising with him raise his brethren ransomed with his own dear life so heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate giving to death and dying to redeem so dearly to redeem what hellish hate so easily destroyed and still destroys in those who when they may accept not grace nor shalt thou by descending to assume man nature lessen or degrade thine own because thou hast though throned in highest bliss equal to god and equally enjoying godike fruition quitted all to save a world from utter loss and hast been found by merit more than birthright son of god found worthiest to be so by being good far more than great or high because in thee love hath abounded more than glory abounds therefore thy humiliation shall exalt with thee thy manhood also to this throne here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign both god and man son both of god and man anointed universal king all power i give thee reign for ever and assume thy merits under thee as head supreme thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide in heaven or earth or under earth in hell when thou attended gloriously from heaven shalt in the sky appear and from thee send the summoning archngels to proclaim thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds the living and forthwith the cited dead of all past ages to the general doom shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge bad men and angels they arraigned shall sink beneath thy sentence hell her numbers full thenceforth shall be for ever shut mean while the world shall burn and from her ashes spring new heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell and after all their tribulations long see golden days fruitful of golden deeds with joy and peace triumphing and fair truth then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by for regal scepter then no more shall need god shall be all in all but all ye gods adore him who to compass all this dies adore the son and honour him as me no sooner had the almighty ceased but all the multitude of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number sweet as from blest voices uttering joy heaven rung with jubilee and loud hosannas filled the eternal regions lowly reverent towards either throne they bow and to the ground with solemn adoration down they cast their crowns inwove with amarant and gold immortal amarant a flower which once in paradise fast by the tree of life began to bloom but soon for man offence to heaven removed where first it grew there grows and flowers aloft shading the fount of life and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven rolls or elysian flowers her amber stream with these that never fade the spirits elect bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright pavement that like a sea of jasper shone impurpled with celestial roses smiled then crowned again their golden harps they took harps ever tuned that glittering by their side like quivers hung and with preamble sweet of charming symphony they introduce their sacred song and waken raptures high no voice exempt no voice but well could join melodious part such concord is in heaven thee father first they sung omnipotent immutable immortal infinite eternal king the author of all being fountain of light thyself invisible amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitt throned inaccessible but when thou shadest the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim approach not but with both wings veil their eyes thee next they sang of all creation first begotten son divine similitude in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud made visible the almighty father shines whom else no creature can behold on thee impressed the effulgence of his glory abides transfused on thee his ample spirit rests he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created and by thee threw down the aspiring dominations thou that day thy father dreadful thunder didst not spare nor stop thy flaming chariotheels that shook heaven everlasting frame while or the necks thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim thee only extolled son of thy father might to execute fierce vengeance on his foes not so on man him through their malice fallen father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom so strictly but much more to pity incline no sooner did thy dear and only son perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man so strictly but much more to pity inclined he to appease thy wrath and end the strife of mercy and justice in thy face discerned regardless of the bliss wherein he sat second to thee offered himself to die for man offence o unexampled love love no where to be found less than divine hail son of god saviour of men thy name shall be the copious matter of my song henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise forget nor from thy father praise disjoin thus they in heaven above the starry sphere their happy hours in joy and hymning spent mean while upon the firm opacous globe of this round world whose first convex divides the luminous inferiour orbs enclosed from chaos and the inroad of darkness old satan alighted walks a globe far off it seemed now seems a boundless continent dark waste and wild under the frown of night starless exposed and everhreatening storms of chaos blustering round inclement sky save on that side which from the wall of heaven though distant far some small reflection gains of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud here walked the fiend at large in spacious field as when a vultur on imaus bred whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds dislodging from a region scarce of prey to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs of ganges or hydaspes indian streams but in his way lights on the barren plains of sericana where chineses drive with sails and wind their cany waggons light so on this windy sea of land the fiend walked up and down alone bent on his prey alone for other creature in this place living or lifeless to be found was none none yet but store hereafter from the earth up hither like aereal vapours flew of all things transitory and vain when sin with vanity had filled the works of men both all things vain and all who in vain things built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame or happiness in this or the other life all who have their reward on earth the fruits of painful superstition and blind zeal nought seeking but the praise of men here find fit retribution empty as their deeds all the unaccomplished works of nature hand abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain till final dissolution wander here not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed those argent fields more likely habitants translated saints or middle spirits hold betwixt the angelical and human kind hither of illoined sons and daughters born first from the ancient world those giants came with many a vain exploit though then renowned the builders next of babel on the plain of sennaar and still with vain design new babels had they wherewithal would build others came single he who to be deemed a god leaped fondly into aetna flames empedocles and he who to enjoy plato elysium leaped into the sea cleombrotus and many more too long embryos and idiots eremites and friars white black and gray with all their trumpery here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven and they who to be sure of paradise dying put on the weeds of dominick or in franciscan think to pass disguised they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed and that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation talked and that first moved and now saint peter at heaven wicket seems to wait them with his keys and now at foot of heaven ascent they lift their feet when lo a violent cross wind from either coast blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry into the devious air then might ye see cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost and fluttered into rags then reliques beads indulgences dispenses pardons bulls the sport of winds all these upwhirled aloft fly or the backside of the world far off into a limbo large and broad since called the paradise of fools to few unknown long after now unpeopled and untrod all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed and long he wandered till at last a gleam of dawning light turned thitherard in haste his travelled steps far distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high at top whereof but far more rich appeared the work as of a kingly palaceate with frontispiece of diamond and gold embellished thick with sparkling orient gems the portal shone inimitable on earth by model or by shading pencil drawn these stairs were such as whereon jacob saw angels ascending and descending bands of guardians bright when he from esau fled to padanram in the field of luz dreaming by night under the open sky and waking cried this is the gate of heaven each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon who after came from earth failing arrived wafted by angels or flew or the lake rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds the stairs were then let down whether to dare the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate his sad exclusion from the doors of bliss direct against which opened from beneath just or the blissful seat of paradise a passage down to the earth a passage wide wider by far than that of afterimes over mount sion and though that were large over the promised land to god so dear by which to visit oft those happy tribes on high behests his angels to and fro passed frequent and his eye with choice regard from paneas the fount of jordan flood to beersaba where the holy land borders on egypt and the arabian shore so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set to darkness such as bound the ocean wave satan from hence now on the lower stair that scaled by steps of gold to heavenate looks down with wonder at the sudden view of all this world at once as when a scout through dark and desert ways with peril gone all night at last by break of cheerful dawn obtains the brow of some highlimbing hill which to his eye discovers unaware the goodly prospect of some foreign land first seen or some renowned metropolis with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned which now the rising sun gilds with his beams such wonder seised though after heaven seen the spirit malign but much more envy seised at sight of all this world beheld so fair round he surveys and well might where he stood so high above the circling canopy of night extended shade from eastern point of libra to the fleecy star that bears andromeda far off atlantick seas beyond the horizon then from pole to pole he views in breadth and without longer pause down right into the world first region throws his flight precipitant and winds with ease through the pure marble air his oblique way amongst innumerable stars that shone stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds or other worlds they seemed or happy isles like those hesperian gardens famed of old fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there he staid not to inquire above them all the golden sun in splendour likest heaven allured his eye thither his course he bends through the calm firmament but up or down by center or eccentrick hard to tell or longitude where the great luminary aloof the vulgar constellations thick that from his lordly eye keep distance due dispenses light from far they as they move their starry dance in numbers that compute days months and years towards his allheering lamp turn swift their various motions or are turned by his magnetick beam that gently warms the universe and to each inward part with gentle penetration though unseen shoots invisible virtue even to the deep so wonderously was set his station bright there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps astronomer in the sun lucent orb through his glazed optick tube yet never saw the place he found beyond expression bright compared with aught on earth metal or stone not all parts like but all alike informed with radiant light as glowing iron with fire if metal part seemed gold part silver clear if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone in breastlate and a stone besides imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen that stone or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought in vain though by their powerful art they bind volatile hermes and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea drained through a limbeck to his native form what wonder then if fields and regions here breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run potable gold when with one virtuous touch the archhemick sun so far from us remote produces with terrestrial humour mixed here in the dark so many precious things of colour glorious and effect so rare here matter new to gaze the devil met undazzled far and wide his eye commands for sight no obstacle found here nor shade but all sunhine as when his beams at noon culminate from the equator as they now shot upward still direct whence no way round shadow from body opaque can fall and the air no where so clear sharpened his visual ray to objects distant far whereby he soon saw within ken a glorious angel stand the same whom john saw also in the sun his back was turned but not his brightness hid of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar circled his head nor less his locks behind illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings lay waving round on some great charge employed he seemed or fixed in cogitation deep glad was the spirit impure as now in hope to find who might direct his wandering flight to paradise the happy seat of man his journey end and our beginning woe but first he casts to change his proper shape which else might work him danger or delay and now a stripling cherub he appears not of the prime yet such as in his face youth smiled celestial and to every limb suitable grace diffused so well he feigned under a coronet his flowing hair in curls on either cheek played wings he wore of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold his habit fit for speed succinct and held before his decent steps a silver wand he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned admonished by his ear and straight was known the archngel uriel one of the seven who in god presence nearest to his throne stand ready at command and are his eyes that run through all the heavens or down to the earth bear his swift errands over moist and dry or sea and land him satan thus accosts uriel for thou of those seven spirits that stand in sight of god high throne gloriously bright the first art wont his great authentick will interpreter through highest heaven to bring where all his sons thy embassy attend and here art likeliest by supreme decree like honour to obtain and as his eye to visit oft this new creation round unspeakable desire to see and know all these his wonderous works but chiefly man his chief delight and favour him for whom all these his works so wonderous he ordained hath brought me from the quires of cherubim alone thus wandering brightest seraph tell in which of all these shining orbs hath man his fixed seat or fixed seat hath none but all these shining orbs his choice to dwell that i may find him and with secret gaze or open admiration him behold on whom the great creator hath bestowed worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured that both in him and all things as is meet the universal maker we may praise who justly hath driven out his rebel foes to deepest hell and to repair that loss created this new happy race of men to serve him better wise are all his ways so spake the false dissembler unperceived for neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible except to god alone by his permissive will through heaven and earth and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps at wisdom gate and to simplicity resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill where no ill seems which now for once beguiled uriel though regent of the sun and held the sharpestighted spirit of all in heaven who to the fraudulent impostor foul in his uprightness answer thus returned fair angel thy desire which tends to know the works of god thereby to glorify the great workaster leads to no excess that reaches blame but rather merits praise the more it seems excess that led thee hither from thy empyreal mansion thus alone to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps contented with report hear only in heaven for wonderful indeed are all his works pleasant to know and worthiest to be all had in remembrance always with delight but what created mind can comprehend their number or the wisdom infinite that brought them forth but hid their causes deep i saw when at his word the formless mass this world material mould came to a heap confusion heard his voice and wild uproar stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined till at his second bidding darkness fled light shone and order from disorder sprung swift to their several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire and this ethereal quintessence of heaven flew upward spirited with various forms that rolled orbicular and turned to stars numberless as thou seest and how they move each had his place appointed each his course the rest in circuit walls this universe look downward on that globe whose hither side with light from hence though but reflected shines that place is earth the seat of man that light his day which else as the other hemisphere night would invade but there the neighbouring moon so call that opposite fair sta her aid timely interposes and her monthly round still ending still renewing through mid heaven with borrowed light her countenance triform hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth and in her pale dominion checks the night that spot to which i point is paradise adam abode those lofty shades his bower thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires thus said he turned and satan bowing low as to superiour spirits is wont in heaven where honour due and reverence none neglects took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel nor staid till on niphates top he lights book o for that warning voice which he who saw the apocalypse heard cry in heaven aloud then when the dragon put to second rout came furious down to be revenged on men woe to the inhabitants on earth that now while time was our first parents had been warned the coming of their secret foe and caped haply so caped his mortal snare for now satan now first inflamed with rage came down the tempter ere the accuser of mankind to wreak on innocent frail man his loss of that first battle and his flight to hell yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold far off and fearless nor with cause to boast begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast and like a devilish engine back recoils upon himself horrour and doubt distract his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir the hell within him for within him hell he brings and round about him nor from hell one step no more than from himself can fly by change of place now conscience wakes despair that slumbered wakes the bitter memory of what he was what is and what must be worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue sometimes towards eden which now in his view lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad sometimes towards heaven and the fulllazing sun which now sat high in his meridian tower then much revolving thus in sighs began o thou that with surpassing glory crowned lookest from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the stars hide their diminished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name of sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy sphere till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heaven against heaven matchless king ah wherefore he deserved no such return from me whom he created what i was in that bright eminence and with his good upbraided none nor was his service hard what could be less than to afford him praise the easiest recompence and pay him thanks how due yet all his good proved ill in me and wrought but malice lifted up so high i deined subjection and thought one step higher would set me highest and in a moment quit the debt immense of endless gratitude so burdensome still paying still to owe forgetful what from him i still received and understood not that a grateful mind by owing owes not but still pays at once indebted and discharged what burden then o had his powerful destiny ordained me some inferiour angel i had stood then happy no unbounded hope had raised ambition yet why not some other power as great might have aspired and me though mean drawn to his part but other powers as great fell not but stand unshaken from within or from without to all temptations armed hadst thou the same free will and power to stand thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse but heaven free love dealt equally to all be then his love accursed since love or hate to me alike it deals eternal woe nay cursed be thou since against his thy will chose freely what it now so justly rues me miserable which way shall i fly infinite wrath and infinite despair which way i fly is hell myself am hell and in the lowest deep a lower deep still threatening to devour me opens wide to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven o then at last relent is there no place left for repentance none for pardon left none left but by submission and that word disdain forbids me and my dread of shame among the spirits beneath whom i seduced with other promises and other vaunts than to submit boasting i could subdue the omnipotent ay me they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vain under what torments inwardly i groan while they adore me on the throne of hell with diadem and scepter high advanced the lower still i fall only supreme in misery such joy ambition finds but say i could repent and could obtain by act of grace my former state how soon would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay what feigned submission swore ease would recant vows made in pain as violent and void for never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep which would but lead me to a worse relapse and heavier fall so should i purchase dear short intermission bought with double smart this knows my punisher therefore as far from granting he as i from begging peace all hope excluded thus behold instead of us outast exil his new delight mankind created and for him this world so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear farewell remorse all good to me is lost evil be thou my good by thee at least divided empire with heaven king i hold by thee and more than half perhaps will reign as man ere long and this new world shall know thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed him counterfeit if any eye beheld for heavenly minds from such distempers foul are ever clear whereof he soon aware each perturbation smoothed with outward calm artificer of fraud and was the first that practised falsehood under saintly show deep malice to conceal couched with revenge yet not enough had practised to deceive uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down the way he went and on the assyrian mount saw him disfigured more than could befall spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce he marked and mad demeanour then alone as he supposed all unobserved unseen so on he fares and to the border comes of eden where delicious paradise now nearer crowns with her enclosure green as with a rural mound the champaign head of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides with thicket overgrown grotesque and wild access denied and overhead upgrew insuperable height of loftiest shade cedar and pine and fir and branching palm a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend shade above shade a woody theatre of stateliest view yet higher than their tops the verdurous wall of paradise upsprung which to our general sire gave prospect large into his nether empire neighbouring round and higher than that wall a circling row of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed on which the sun more glad impressed his beams than in fair evening cloud or humid bow when god hath showered the earth so lovely seemed that landskip and of pure now purer air meets his approach and to the heart inspires vernal delight and joy able to drive all sadness but despair now gentle gales fanning their odoriferous wings dispense native perfumes and whisper whence they stole those balmy spoils as when to them who fail beyond the cape of hope and now are past mozambick off at sea northast winds blow sabean odours from the spicy shore of araby the blest with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend who came their bane though with them better pleased than asmodeus with the fishy fume that drove him though enamoured from the spouse of tobit son and with a vengeance sent from media post to egypt there fast bound now to the ascent of that steep savage hill satan had journeyed on pensive and slow but further way found none so thick entwined as one continued brake the undergrowth of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed all path of man or beast that passed that way one gate there only was and that looked east on the other side which when the archelon saw due entrance he disdained and in contempt at one flight bound high overeaped all bound of hill or highest wall and sheer within lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve in hurdled cotes amid the field secure leaps or the fence with ease into the fold or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash of some rich burgher whose substantial doors crossarred and bolted fast fear no assault in at the window climbs or or the tiles so clomb this first grand thief into god fold so since into his church lewd hirelings climb thence up he flew and on the tree of life the middle tree and highest there that grew sat like a cormorant yet not true life thereby regained but sat devising death to them who lived nor on the virtue thought of that lifeiving plant but only used for prospect what well used had been the pledge of immortality so little knows any but god alone to value right the good before him but perverts best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use beneath him with new wonder now he views to all delight of human sense exposed in narrow room nature whole wealth yea more a heaven on earth for blissful paradise of god the garden was by him in the east of eden planted eden stretched her line from auran eastward to the royal towers of great seleucia built by grecian kings or where the sons of eden long before dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soil his far more pleasant garden god ordained out of the fertile ground he caused to grow all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste and all amid them stood the tree of life high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit of vegetable gold and next to life our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill southward through eden went a river large nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill passed underneath ingulfed for god had thrown that mountain as his gardenould high raised upon the rapid current which through veins of porous earth with kindly thirst uprawn rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill watered the garden thence united fell down the steep glade and met the nether flood which from his darksome passage now appears and now divided into four main streams runs diverse wandering many a famous realm and country whereof here needs no account but rather to tell how if art could tell how from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold with mazy errour under pendant shades ran nectar visiting each plant and fed flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art in beds and curious knots but nature boon poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain both where the morning sun first warmly smote the open field and where the unpierced shade imbrowned the noontide bowers thus was this place a happy rural seat of various view groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm others whose fruit burnished with golden rind hung amiable hesperian fables true if true here only and of delicious taste betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks grazing the tender herb were interposed or palmy hillock or the flowery lap of some irriguous valley spread her store flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose another side umbrageous grots and caves of cool recess or which the mantling vine lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake that to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams the birds their quire apply airs vernal airs breathing the smell of field and grove attune the trembling leaves while universal pan knit with the graces and the hours in dance led on the eternal spring not that fair field of enna where proserpine gathering flowers herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis was gathered which cost ceres all that pain to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove of daphne by orontes and the inspired castalian spring might with this paradise of eden strive nor that nyseian isle girt with the river triton where old cham whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame rhea eye nor where abassin kings their issue guard mount amara though this by some supposed true paradise under the ethiop line by nilus head enclosed with shining rock a whole day journey high but wide remote from this assyrian garden where the fiend saw undelighted all delight all kind of living creatures new to sight and strange two of far nobler shape erect and tall godlike erect with native honour clad in naked majesty seemed lords of all and worthy seemed for in their looks divine the image of their glorious maker shone truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom placed whence true authority in men though both not equal as their sex not equal seemed for contemplation he and valour formed for softness she and sweet attractive grace he for god only she for god in him his fair large front and eye sublime declared absolute rule and hyacinthine locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad she as a veil down to the slender waist her unadorned golden tresses wore dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved as the vine curls her tendrils which implied subjection but required with gentle sway and by her yielded by him best received yielded with coy submission modest pride and sweet reluctant amorous delay nor those mysterious parts were then concealed then was not guilty shame dishonest shame of nature works honour dishonourable sinred how have ye troubled all mankind with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure and banished from man life his happiest life simplicity and spotless innocence so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight of god or angel for they thought no ill so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair that ever since in love embraces met adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve under a tuft of shade that on a green stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side they sat them down and after no more toil of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed to recommend cool zephyr and made ease more easy wholesome thirst and appetite more grateful to their supperruits they fell nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs yielded them sideong as they sat recline on the soft downy bank damasked with flowers the savoury pulp they chew and in the rind still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems fair couple linked in happy nuptial league alone as they about them frisking played all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase in wood or wilderness forest or den sporting the lion ramped and in his paw dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant to make them mirth used all his might and wreathed his lithe proboscis close the serpent sly insinuating wove with gordian twine his braided train and of his fatal guile gave proof unheeded others on the grass couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat or bedward ruminating for the sun declined was hasting now with prone career to the ocean isles and in the ascending scale of heaven the stars that usher evening rose when satan still in gaze as first he stood scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold into our room of bliss thus high advanced creatures of other mould earthorn perhaps not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue with wonder and could love so lively shines in them divine resemblance and such grace the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh your change approaches when all these delights will vanish and deliver ye to woe more woe the more your taste is now of joy happy but for so happy ill secured long to continue and this high seat your heaven ill fenced for heaven to keep out such a foe as now is entered yet no purposed foe to you whom i could pity thus forlorn though i unpitied league with you i seek and mutual amity so strait so close that i with you must dwell or you with me henceforth my dwelling haply may not please like this fair paradise your sense yet such accept your maker work he gave it me which i as freely give hell shall unfold to entertain you two her widest gates and send forth all her kings there will be room not like these narrow limits to receive your numerous offspring if no better place thank him who puts me loth to this revenge on you who wrong me not for him who wronged and should i at your harmless innocence melt as i do yet publick reason just honour and empire with revenge enlarged by conquering this new world compels me now to do what else though damned i should abhor so spake the fiend and with necessity the tyrant plea excused his devilish deeds then from his lofty stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those fourooted kinds himself now one now other as their shape served best his end nearer to view his prey and unespied to mark what of their state he more might learn by word or action marked about them round a lion now he stalks with fiery glare then as a tiger who by chance hath spied in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play straight couches close then rising changes oft his couchant watch as one who chose his ground whence rushing he might surest seize them both griped in each paw when adam first of men to first of women eve thus moving speech turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow sole partner and sole part of all these joys dearer thyself than all needs must the power that made us and for us this ample world be infinitely good and of his good as liberal and free as infinite that raised us from the dust and placed us here in all this happiness who at his hand have nothing merited nor can perform aught whereof he hath need he who requires from us no other service than to keep this one this easy charge of all the trees in paradise that bear delicious fruit so various not to taste that only tree of knowledge planted by the tree of life so near grows death to life whater death is some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree the only sign of our obedience left among so many signs of power and rule conferred upon us and dominion given over all other creatures that possess earth air and sea then let us not think hard one easy prohibition who enjoy free leave so large to all things else and choice unlimited of manifold delights but let us ever praise him and extol his bounty following our delightful task to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head what thou hast said is just and right for we to him indeed all praises owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so far the happier lot enjoying thee preminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thyself canst no where find that day i oft remember when from sleep i first awaked and found myself reposed under a shade on flowers much wondering where and what i was whence thither brought and how not distant far from thence a murmuring sound of waters issued from a cave and spread into a liquid plain then stood unmoved pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went with unexperienced thought and laid me down on the green bank to look into the clear smooth lake that to me seemed another sky as i bent down to look just opposite a shape within the watery gleam appeared bending to look on me i started back it started back but pleased i soon returned pleased it returned as soon with answering looks of sympathy and love there i had fixed mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest what there thou seest fair creature is thyself with thee it came and goes but follow me and i will bring thee where no shadow stays thy coming and thy soft embraces he whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy inseparably thine to him shalt bear multitudes like thyself and thence be called mother of human race what could i do but follow straight invisibly thus led till i espied thee fair indeed and tall under a platane yet methought less fair less winning soft less amiably mild than that smooth watery image back i turned thou following cryedst aloud return fair eve whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent out of my side to thee nearest my heart substantial life to have thee by my side henceforth an individual solace dear part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim my other half with that thy gentle hand seised mine i yielded and from that time see how beauty is excelled by manly grace and wisdom which alone is truly fair so spake our general mother and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreproved and meek surrender halfmbracing leaned on our first father half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smiled with superiour love as jupiter on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds that shed mayflowers and pressed her matron lip with kisses pure aside the devil turned for envy yet with jealous leer malign eyed them askance and to himself thus plained sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two imparadised in one another arms the happier eden shall enjoy their fill of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust where neither joy nor love but fierce desire among our other torments not the least still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines yet let me not forget what i have gained from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden suspicious reasonless why should their lord envy them that can it be sin to know can it be death and do they only stand by ignorance is that their happy state the proof of their obedience and their faith o fair foundation laid whereon to build their ruin hence i will excite their minds with more desire to know and to reject envious commands invented with design to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt equal with gods aspiring to be such they taste and die what likelier can ensue but first with narrow search i must walk round this garden and no corner leave unspied a chance but chance may lead where i may meet some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side or in thick shade retired from him to draw what further would be learned live while ye may yet happy pair enjoy till i return short pleasures for long woes are to succeed so saying his proud step he scornful turned but with sly circumspection and began through wood through waste or hill or dale his roam mean while in utmost longitude where heaven with earth and ocean meets the setting sun slowly descended and with right aspect against the eastern gate of paradise levelled his evening rays it was a rock of alabaster piled up to the clouds conspicuous far winding with one ascent accessible from earth one entrance high the rest was craggy cliff that overhung still as it rose impossible to climb betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat chief of the angelick guards awaiting night about him exercised heroick games the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand celestial armoury shields helms and spears hung high with diamond flaming and with gold thither came uriel gliding through the even on a suneam swift as a shooting star in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired impress the air and shows the mariner from what point of his compass to beware impetuous winds he thus began in haste gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given charge and strict watch that to this happy place no evil thing approach or enter in this day at highth of noon came to my sphere a spirit zealous as he seemed to know more of the almighty works and chiefly man god latest image i described his way bent all on speed and marked his aery gait but in the mount that lies from eden north where he first lighted soon discerned his looks alien from heaven with passions foul obscured mine eye pursued him still but under shade lost sight of him one of the banished crew i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise new troubles him thy care must be to find to whom the winged warriour thus returned uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight amid the sun bright circle where thou sitst see far and wide in at this gate none pass the vigilance here placed but such as come well known from heaven and since meridian hour no creature thence if spirit of other sort so minded have oreaped these earthly bounds on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude spiritual substance with corporeal bar but if within the circuit of these walks in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know so promised he and uriel to his charge returned on that bright beam whose point now raised bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen beneath the azores whether the prime orb incredible how swift had thither rolled diurnal or this less volubil earth by shorter flight to the east had left him there arraying with reflected purple and gold the clouds that on his western throne attend now came still evening on and twilight gray had in her sober livery all things clad silence accompanied for beast and bird they to their grassy couch these to their nests were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale she all night long her amorous descant sung silence was pleased now glowed the firmament with living sapphires hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and or the dark her silver mantle threw when adam thus to eve fair consort the hour of night and all things now retired to rest mind us of like repose since god hath set labour and rest as day and night to men successive and the timely dew of sleep now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines our eyeids other creatures all day long rove idle unemployed and less need rest man hath his daily work of body or mind appointed which declares his dignity and the regard of heaven on all his ways while other animals unactive range and of their doings god takes no account toorrow ere fresh morning streak the east with first approach of light we must be risen and at our pleasant labour to reform yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green our walk at noon with branches overgrown that mock our scant manuring and require more hands than ours to lop their wanton growth those blossoms also and those dropping gums that lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease mean while as nature wills night bids us rest to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorned my author and disposer what thou bidst unargued i obey so god ordains god is thy law thou mine to know no more is woman happiest knowledge and her praise with thee conversing i forget all time all seasons and their change all please alike sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth after soft showers and sweet the coming on of grateful evening mild then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon and these the gems of heaven her starry train but neither breath of morn when she ascends with charm of earliest birds nor rising sun on this delightful land nor herb fruit flower glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers nor grateful evening mild nor silent night with this her solemn bird nor walk by moon or glittering staright without thee is sweet but wherefore all night long shine these for whom this glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes to whom our general ancestor replied daughter of god and man accomplished eve these have their course to finish round the earth by morrow evening and from land to land in order though to nations yet unborn ministring light prepared they set and rise lest total darkness should by night regain her old possession and extinguish life in nature and all things which these soft fires not only enlighten but with kindly heat of various influence foment and warm temper or nourish or in part shed down their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow on earth made hereby apter to receive perfection from the sun more potent ray these then though unbeheld in deep of night shine not in vain nor think though men were none that heaven would want spectators god want praise millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen both when we wake and when we sleep all these with ceaseless praise his works behold both day and night how often from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air sole or responsive each to others note singing their great creator oft in bands while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds in full harmonick number joined their songs divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven thus talking hand in hand alone they passed on to their blissful bower it was a place chosen by the sovran planter when he framed all things to man delightful use the roof of thickest covert was inwoven shade laurel and myrtle and what higher grew of firm and fragrant leaf on either side acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower iris all hues roses and jessamin reared high their flourished heads between and wrought mosaick underfoot the violet crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broidered the ground more coloured than with stone of costliest emblem other creature here bird beast insect or worm durst enter none such was their awe of man in shadier bower more sacred and sequestered though but feigned pan or sylvanus never slept nor nymph nor faunus haunted here in close recess with flowers garlands and sweetmelling herbs espoused eve decked first her nuptial bed and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorned more lovely than pandora whom the gods endowed with all their gifts and o too like in sad event when to the unwiser son of japhet brought by hermes she ensnared mankind with her fair looks to be avenged on him who had stole jove authentick fire thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood both turned and under open sky adored the god that made both sky air earth and heaven which they beheld the moon resplendent globe and starry pole thou also madest the night maker omnipotent and thou the day which we in our appointed work employed have finished happy in our mutual help and mutual love the crown of all our bliss ordained by thee and this delicious place for us too large where thy abundance wants partakers and uncropt falls to the ground but thou hast promised from us two a race to fill the earth who shall with us extol thy goodness infinite both when we wake and when we seek as now thy gift of sleep this said unanimous and other rites observing none but adoration pure which god likes best into their inmost bower handed they went and eased the putting off these troublesome disguises which we wear straight side by side were laid nor turned i ween adam from his fair spouse nor eve the rites mysterious of connubial love refused whatever hypocrites austerely talk of purity and place and innocence defaming as impure what god declares pure and commands to some leaves free to all our maker bids encrease who bids abstain but our destroyer foe to god and man hail wedded love mysterious law true source of human offspring sole propriety in paradise of all things common else by thee adulterous lust was driven from men among the bestial herds to range by thee founded in reason loyal just and pure relations dear and all the charities of father son and brother first were known far be it that i should write thee sin or blame or think thee unbefitting holiest place perpetual fountain of domestick sweets whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced present or past as saints and patriarchs used here love his golden shafts employs here lights his constant lamp and waves his purple wings reigns here and revels not in the bought smile of harlots loveless joyless unendeared casual fruition nor in courtmours mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball or serenate which the starved lover sings to his proud fair best quitted with disdain these lulled by nightingales embracing slept and on their naked limbs the flowery roof showered roses which the morn repaired sleep on blest pair and o yet happiest if ye seek no happier state and know to know no more now had night measured with her shadowy cone half way up hill this vast sublunar vault and from their ivory port the cherubim forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed to their night watches in warlike parade when gabriel to his next in power thus spake uzziel half these draw off and coast the south with strictest watch these other wheel the north our circuit meets full west as flame they part half wheeling to the shield half to the spear from these two strong and subtle spirits he called that near him stood and gave them thus in charge ithuriel and zephon with winged speed search through this garden leave unsearched no nook but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm this evening from the sun decline arrived who tells of some infernal spirit seen hitherward bent who could have thought escaped the bars of hell on errand bad no doubt such where ye find seise fast and hither bring so saying on he led his radiant files dazzling the moon these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought him there they found squat like a toad close at the ear of eve assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancy and with them forge illusions as he list phantasms and dreams or if inspiring venom he might taint the animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise at least distempered discontented thoughts vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires blown up with high conceits ingendering pride him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to its own likeness up he starts discovered and surprised as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid fit for the tun some magazine to store against a rumoured war the smutty grain with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air so started up in his own shape the fiend back stept those two fair angels half amazed so sudden to behold the grisly king yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed why satt thou like an enemy in wait here watching at the head of these that sleep know ye not then said satan filled with scorn know ye not me ye knew me once no mate for you there sitting where ye durst not soar not to know me argues yourselves unknown the lowest of your throng or if ye know why ask ye and superfluous begin your message like to end as much in vain to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn think not revolted spirit thy shape the same or undiminished brightness to be known as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure that glory then when thou no more wast good departed from thee and thou resemblest now thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul but come for thou be sure shalt give account to him who sent us whose charge is to keep this place inviolable and these from harm so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beauty added grace invincible abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined his loss but chiefly to find here observed his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed undaunted if i must contend said he best with the best the sender not the sent or all at once more glory will be won or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold will save us trial what the least can do single against thee wicked and thence weak the fiend replied not overcome with rage but like a proud steed reined went haughty on champing his iron curb to strive or fly he held it vain awe from above had quelled his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh the western point where those halfounding guards just met and closing stood in squadron joined a waiting next command to whom their chief gabriel from the front thus called aloud o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet hasting this way and now by glimpse discern ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with them comes a third of regal port but faded splendour wan who by his gait and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest stand firm for in his look defiance lours he scarce had ended when those two approached and brief related whom they brought where found how busied in what form and posture couched to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge of others who approve not to transgress by thy example but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place employed it seems to violate sleep and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise and such i held thee but this question asked puts me in doubt lives there who loves his pain who would not finding way break loose from hell though thither doomed thou wouldst thyself no doubt and boldly venture to whatever place farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change torment with ease and soonest recompense dole with delight which in this place i sought to thee no reason who knowest only good but evil hast not tried and wilt object his will who bounds us let him surer bar his iron gates if he intends our stay in that dark durance thus much what was asked the rest is true they found me where they say but that implies not violence or harm thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved disdainfully half smiling thus replied o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise since satan fell whom folly overthrew and now returns him from his prison caped gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise or not who ask what boldness brought him hither unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed so wise he judges it to fly from pain however and to cape his punishment so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell which taught thee yet no better that no pain can equal anger infinite provoked but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose or thou than they less hardy to endure courageous chief the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged to thy deserted host this cause of flight thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern not that i less endure or shrink from pain insulting angel well thou knowest i stood thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid the blasting vollied thunder made all speed and seconded thy else not dreaded spear but still thy words at random as before argue thy inexperience what behoves from hard assays and ill successes past a faithful leader not to hazard all through ways of danger by himself untried i therefore i alone first undertook to wing the desolate abyss and spy this new created world whereof in hell fame is not silent here in hope to find better abode and my afflicted powers to settle here on earth or in mid air though for possession put to try once more what thou and thy gay legions dare against whose easier business were to serve their lord high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne and practised distances to cringe not fight to whom the warriour angel soon replied to say and straight unsay pretending first wise to fly pain professing next the spy argues no leader but a liar traced satan and couldst thou faithful add o name o sacred name of faithfulness profaned faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew army of fiends fit body to fit head was this your discipline and faith engaged your military obedience to dissolve allegiance to the acknowledged power supreme and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem patron of liberty who more than thou once fawned and cringed and servilely adored heaven awful monarch wherefore but in hope to dispossess him and thyself to reign but mark what i arreed thee now avant fly neither whence thou fledst if from this hour within these hallowed limits thou appear back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained and seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn the facile gates of hell too slightly barred so threatened he but satan to no threats gave heed but waxing more in rage replied then when i am thy captive talk of chains proud limitary cherub but ere then far heavier load thyself expect to feel from my prevailing arm though heaven king ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers us to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels in progress through the road of heaven staraved while thus he spake the angelick squadron bright turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns their phalanx and began to hem him round with ported spears as thick as when a field of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends her bearded grove of ears which way the wind sways them the careful plowman doubting stands left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremoved his stature reached the sky and on his crest sat horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds might have ensued nor only paradise in this commotion but the starry cope of heaven perhaps or all the elements at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn with violence of this conflict had not soon the eternal to prevent such horrid fray hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign wherein all things created first he weighed the pendulous round earth with balanced air in counterpoise now ponders all events battles and realms in these he put two weights the sequel each of parting and of fight the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine neither our own but given what folly then to boast what arms can do since thine no more than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now to trample thee as mire for proof look up and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled murmuring and with him fled the shades of night book now morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl when adam waked so customed for his sleep was aeryight from pure digestion bred and temperate vapours bland which the only sound of leaves and fuming rills aurora fan lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song of birds on every bough so much the more his wonder was to find unwakened eve with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest he on his side leaning half raised with looks of cordial love hung over her enamoured and beheld beauty which whether waking or asleep shot forth peculiar graces then with voice mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes her hand soft touching whispered thus awake my fairest my espoused my latest found heaven last best gift my ever new delight awake the morning shines and the fresh field calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring our tender plants how blows the citron grove what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed how nature paints her colours how the bee sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet such whispering waked her but with startled eye on adam whom embracing thus she spake o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose my glory my perfection glad i see thy face and morn returned for i this night such night till this i never passe have dreamed if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee works of day past or morrow next design but of offence and trouble which my mind knew never till this irksome night methought close at mine ear one called me forth to walk with gentle voice i thought it thine it said why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time the cool the silent save where silence yields to the nightarbling bird that now awake tunes sweetest his loveaboured song now reigns fullrbed the moon and with more pleasing light shadowy sets off the face of things in vain if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes whom to behold but thee nature desire in whose sight all things joy with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze i rose as at thy call but found thee not to find thee i directed then my walk and on methought alone i passed through ways that brought me on a sudden to the tree of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed much fairer to my fancy than by day and as i wondering looked beside it stood one shaped and winged like one of those from heaven by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled ambrosia on that tree he also gazed and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharged deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet nor god nor man is knowledge so despised or envy or what reserve forbids to taste forbid who will none shall from me withhold longer thy offered good why else set here this said he paused not but with venturous arm he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold but he thus overjoyed o fruit divine sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt forbidden here it seems as only fit for gods yet able to make gods of men and why not gods of men since good the more communicated more abundant grows the author not impaired but honoured more here happy creature fair angelick eve partake thou also happy though thou art happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be taste this and be henceforth among the gods thyself a goddess not to earth confined but sometimes in the air as we sometimes ascend to heaven by merit thine and see what life the gods live there and such live thou so saying he drew nigh and to me held even to my mouth of that same fruit held part which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell so quickened appetite that i methought could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds with him i flew and underneath beheld the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide and various wondering at my flight and change to this high exaltation suddenly my guide was gone and i methought sunk down and fell asleep but o how glad i waked to find this but a dream thus eve her night related and thus adam answered sad best image of myself and dearer half the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep affects me equally nor can i like this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear yet evil whence in thee can harbour none created pure but know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations aery shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion then retires into her private cell when nature rests oft in her absence mimick fancy wakes to imitate her but misjoining shapes wild work produces oft and most in dreams ill matching words and deeds long past or late some such resemblances methinks i find of our last evening talk in this thy dream but with addition strange yet be not sad evil into the mind of god or man may come and go so unreproved and leave no spot or blame behind which gives me hope that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream waking thou never will consent to do be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks that wont to be more cheerful and serene than when fair morning first smiles on the world and let us to our fresh employments rise among the groves the fountains and the flowers that open now their choisest bosomed smells reserved from night and kept for thee in store so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered but silently a gentle tear let fall from either eye and wiped them with her hair two other precious drops that ready stood each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse and pious awe that feared to have offended so all was cleared and to the field they haste but first from under shady arborous roof soon as they forth were come to open sight of daypring and the sun who scarce upisen with wheels yet hovering or the oceanrim shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray discovering in wide landskip all the east of paradise and eden happy plains lowly they bowed adoring and began their orisons each morning duly paid in various style for neither various style nor holy rapture wanted they to praise their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung unmeditated such prompt eloquence flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse more tuneable than needed lute or harp to add more sweetness and they thus began these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame thus wonderous fair thyself how wonderous then unspeakable who sitst above these heavens to us invisible or dimly seen in these thy lowest works yet these declare thy goodness beyond thought and power divine speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light angels for ye behold him and with songs and choral symphonies day without night circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven on earth join all ye creatures to extol him first him last him midst and without end fairest of stars last in the train of night if better thou belong not to the dawn sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere while day arises that sweet hour of prime thou sun of this great world both eye and soul acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise in thy eternal course both when thou climbest and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies and ye five other wandering fires that move in mystick dance not without song resound his praise who out of darkness called up light air and ye elements the eldest birth of nature womb that in quaternion run perpetual circle multiform and and nourish all things let your ceaseless change vary to our great maker still new praise ye mists and exhalations that now rise from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold in honour to the world great author rise whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers rising or falling still advance his praise his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines with every plant in sign of worship wave fountains and ye that warble as ye flow melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise join voices all ye living souls ye birds that singing up to heavenate ascend bear on your wings and in your notes his praise ye that in waters glide and ye that walk the earth

give us only good and if the night have gathered aught of evil or concealed disperse it as now light dispels the dark so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm on to their morning rural work they haste among sweet dews and flowers where any row of fruitrees overoody reached too far their pampered boughs and needed hands to check fruitless embraces or they led the vine to wed her elm she spoused about him twines her marriageable arms and with him brings her dower the adopted clusters to adorn his barren leaves them thus employed beheld with pity heaven high king and to him called raphael the sociable spirit that deigned to travel with tobias and secured his marriage with the seventimesedded maid raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth satan from hell caped through the darksome gulf hath raised in paradise and how disturbed this night the human pair how he designs in them at once to ruin all mankind go therefore half this day as friend with friend converse with adam in what bower or shade thou findest him from the heat of noon retired to respite his dayabour with repast or with repose and such discourse bring on as may advise him of his happy state happiness in his power left free to will left to his own free will his will though free yet mutable whence warn him to beware he swerve not too secure tell him withal his danger and from whom what enemy late fallen himself from heaven is plotting now the fall of others from like state of bliss by violence no for that shall be withstood but by deceit and lies this let him know lest wilfully transgressing he pretend surprisal unadmonished unforewarned so spake the eternal father and fulfilled all justice nor delayed the winged saint after his charge received but from among thousand celestial ardours where he stood veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light flew through the midst of heaven the angelick quires on each hand parting to his speed gave way through all the empyreal road till at the gate of heaven arrived the gate selfpened wide on golden hinges turning as by work divine the sovran architect had framed from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight star interposed however small he sees not unconformed to other shining globes earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned above all hills as when by night the glass of galileo less assured observes imagined lands and regions in the moon or pilot from amidst the cyclades delos or samos first appearing kens a cloudy spot down thither prone in flight he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing now on the polar winds then with quick fan winnows the buxom air till within soar of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird when to enshrine his reliques in the sun bright temple to egyptian thebes he flies at once on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade his lineaments divine the pair that clad each shoulder broad came mantling or his breast with regal ornament the middle pair girt like a starry zone his waist and round skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold and colours dipt in heaven the third his feet shadowed from either heel with feathered mail skyinctured grain like maia son he stood and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled the circuit wide straight knew him all the bands of angels under watch and to his state and to his message high in honour rise for on some message high they guessed him bound their glittering tents he passed and now is come into the blissful field through groves of myrrh and flowering odours cassia nard and balm a wilderness of sweets for nature here wantoned as in her prime and played at will her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet wild above rule or art enormous bliss him through the spicy forest onward come adam discerned as in the door he sat of his cool bower while now the mounted sun shot down direct his fervid rays to warm earth inmost womb more warmth than adam needs and eve within due at her hour prepared for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please true appetite and not disrelish thirst of nectarous draughts between from milky stream berry or grape to whom thus adam called haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold eastward among those trees what glorious shape comes this way moving seems another morn risen on midoon some great behest from heaven to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe this day to be our guest but go with speed and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour abundance fit to honour and receive our heavenly stranger well we may afford our givers their own gifts and large bestow from large bestowed where nature multiplies her fertile growth and by disburthening grows more fruitful which instructs us not to spare to whom thus eve adam earth hallowed mould of god inspired small store will serve where store all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk save what by frugal storing firmness gains to nourish and superfluous moist consumes but i will haste and from each bough and brake each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice to entertain our angeluest as he beholding shall confess that here on earth god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven so saying with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change bestirs her then and from each tender stalk whatever earth allearing mother yields in india east or west or middle shore in pontus or the punick coast or where alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell she gathers tribute large and on the board heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape she crushes inoffensive must and meaths from many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed mean while our primitive great sire to meet his godike guest walks forth without more train accompanied than with his own complete perfections in himself was all his state more solemn than the tedious pomp that waits on princes when their rich retinue long of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold dazzles the croud and sets them all agape nearer his presence adam though not awed yet with submiss approach and reverence meek as to a superiour nature bowing low thus said native of heaven for other place none can than heaven such glorious shape contain since by descending from the thrones above those happy places thou hast deigned a while to want and honour these vouchsafe with us two only who yet by sovran gift possess this spacious ground in yonder shady bower to rest and what the garden choicest bears to sit and taste till this meridian heat be over and the sun more cool decline whom thus the angelick virtue answered mild adam i therefore came nor art thou such created or such place hast here to dwell as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven to visit thee lead on then where thy bower orshades for these midours till evening rise i have at will so to the sylvan lodge they came that like pomona arbour smiled with flowerets decked and fragrant smells but eve undecked save with herself more lovely fair than woodymph or the fairest goddess feigned of three that in mount ida naked strove stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil she needed virtueroof no thought infirm altered her cheek on whom the angel hail bestowed the holy salutation used long after to blest mary second eve hail mother of mankind whose fruitful womb shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons than with these various fruits the trees of god have heaped this table aised of grassy turf their table was and mossy seats had round and on her ample square from side to side all autumn piled though spring and autumn here danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold no fear lest dinner cool when thus began our author heavenly stranger please to taste these bounties which our nourisher from whom all perfect good unmeasured out descends to us for food and for delight hath caused the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps to spiritual natures only this i know that one celestial father gives to all to whom the angel therefore what he gives whose praise be ever sun to man in part spiritual may of purest spirits be found no ingrateful food and food alike those pure intelligential substances require as doth your rational and both contain within them every lower faculty of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste tasting concoct digest assimilate and corporeal to incorporeal turn for know whatever was created needs to be sustained and fed of elements the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea earth and the sea feed air the air those fires ethereal and as lowest first the moon whence in her visage round those spots unpurged vapours not yet into her substance turned nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale from her moist continent to higher orbs the sun that light imparts to all receives from all his alimental recompence in humid exhalations and at even sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground covered with pearly grain yet god hath here varied his bounty so with new delights as may compare with heaven and to taste think not i shall be nice so down they sat and to their viands fell nor seemingly the angel nor in mist the common gloss of theologians but with keen dispatch of real hunger and concoctive heat to transubstantiate what redounds transpires through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire of sooty coal the empirick alchemist can turn or holds it possible to turn metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold as from the mine mean while at table eve ministered naked and their flowing cups with pleasant liquours crowned o innocence deserving paradise if ever then then had the sons of god excuse to have been enamoured at that sight but in those hearts love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy was understood the injured lover hell thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed not burdened nature sudden mind arose in adam not to let the occasion pass given him by this great conference to know of things above his world and of their being who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw transcend his own so far whose radiant forms divine effulgence whose high power so far exceeded human and his wary speech thus to the empyreal minister he framed inhabitant with god now know i well thy favour in this honour done to man under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed to enter and these earthly fruits to taste food not of angels yet accepted so as that more willingly thou couldst not seem at heaven high feasts to have fed yet what compare to whom the winged hierarch replied o adam one almighty is from whom all things proceed and up to him return if not depraved from good created all such to perfection one first matter all endued with various forms various degrees of substance and in things that live of life but more refined more spiritous and pure as nearer to him placed or nearer tending each in their several active spheres assigned till body up to spirit work in bounds proportioned to each kind so from the root springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves more aery last the bright consummate flower spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit man nourishment by gradual scale sublimed to vital spirits aspire to animal to intellectual give both life and sense fancy and understanding whence the soul reason receives and reason is her being discursive or intuitive discourse is oftest yours the latter most is ours differing but in degree of kind the same wonder not then what god for you saw good if i refuse not but convert as you to proper substance time may come when men with angels may participate and find no inconvenient diet nor too light fare and from these corporal nutriments perhaps your bodies may at last turn all to spirit improved by tract of time and winged ascend ethereal as we or may at choice here or in heavenly paradises dwell if ye be found obedient and retain unalterably firm his love entire whose progeny you are mean while enjoy your fill what happiness this happy state can comprehend incapable of more to whom the patriarch of mankind replied o favourable spirit propitious guest well hast thou taught the way that might direct our knowledge and the scale of nature set from center to circumference whereon in contemplation of created things by steps we may ascend to god but say what meant that caution joined if ye be found obedient can we want obedience then to him or possibly his love desert who formed us from the dust and placed us here full to the utmost measure of what bliss human desires can seek or apprehend to whom the angel son of heaven and earth attend that thou art happy owe to god that thou continuest such owe to thyself that is to thy obedience therein stand this was that caution given thee be advised god made thee perfect not immutable and good he made thee but to persevere he left it in thy power ordained thy will by nature free not overuled by fate inextricable or strict necessity our voluntary service he requires not our necessitated such with him finds no acceptance nor can find for how can hearts not free be tried whether they serve willing or no who will but what they must by destiny and can no other choose myself and all the angelick host that stand in sight of god enthroned our happy state hold as you yours while our obedience holds on other surety none freely we serve because we freely love as in our will to love or not in this we stand or fall and some are fallen to disobedience fallen and so from heaven to deepest hell o fall from what high state of bliss into what woe to whom our great progenitor thy words attentive and with more delighted ear divine instructer i have heard than when cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills aereal musick send nor knew i not to be both will and deed created free yet that we never shall forget to love our maker and obey him whose command single is yet so just my constant thoughts assured me and still assure though what thou tellest hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move but more desire to hear if thou consent the full relation which must needs be strange worthy of sacred silence to be heard and we have yet large day for scarce the sun hath finished half his journey and scarce begins his other half in the great zone of heaven thus adam made request and raphael after short pause assenting thus began high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men sad task and hard for how shall i relate to human sense the invisible exploits of warring spirits how without remorse the ruin of so many glorious once and perfect while they stood how last unfold the secrets of another world perhaps not lawful to reveal yet for thy good this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach of human sense i shall delineate so by likening spiritual to corporal forms as may express them best though what if earth be but a shadow of heaven and things therein each to other like more than on earth is thought as yet this world was not and chaos wild reigned where these heavens now roll where earth now rests upon her center poised when on a day for time though in eternity applied to motion measures all things durable by present past and future on such day as heaven great year brings forth the empyreal host of angels by imperial summons called innumerable before the almighty throne forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared under their hierarchs in orders bright ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced standards and gonfalons wixt van and rear stream in the air and for distinction serve of hierarchies of orders and degrees or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed holy memorials acts of zeal and love recorded eminent thus when in orbs of circuit inexpressible they stood orb within orb the father infinite by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son amidst as from a flaming mount whose top brightness had made invisible thus spake hear all ye angels progeny of light thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand this day i have begot whom i declare my only son and on this holy hill him have anointed whom ye now behold at my right hand your head i him appoint and by myself have sworn to him shall bow all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord under his great viceerent reign abide united as one individual soul for ever happy him who disobeys me disobeys breaks union and that day cast out from god and blessed vision falls into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place ordained without redemption without end so spake the omnipotent and with his words all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all that day as other solemn days they spent in song and dance about the sacred hill mystical dance which yonder starry sphere of planets and of fixed in all her wheels resembles nearest mazes intricate eccentrick intervolved yet regular then most when most irregular they seem and in their motions harmony divine so smooths her charming tones that god own ear listens delighted evening now approached for we have also our evening and our morn we ours for change delectable not need forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn desirous all in circles as they stood tables are set and on a sudden piled with angels food and rubied nectar flows in pearl in diamond and massy gold fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven on flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned they eat they drink and in communion sweet quaff immortality and joy secure of surfeit where full measure only bounds excess before the allounteous king who showered with copious hand rejoicing in their joy now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled from that high mount of god whence light and shade spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed to grateful twilight for night comes not there in darker vei and roseate dews disposed all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest wide over all the plain and wider far than all this globous earth in plain outspread such are the courts of go the angelick throng dispersed in bands and files their camp extend by living streams among the trees of life pavilions numberless and sudden reared celestial tabernacles where they slept fanned with cool winds save those who in their course melodious hymns about the sovran throne alternate all night long but not so waked satan so call him now his former name is heard no more in heaven he of the first if not the first archngel great in power in favour and preminence yet fraught with envy against the son of god that day honoured by his great father and proclaimed messiah king anointed could not bear through pride that sight and thought himself impaired deep malice thence conceiving and disdain soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved with all his legions to dislodge and leave unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme contemptuous and his next subordinate awakening thus to him in secret spake sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close thy eyeids and rememberest what decree of yesterday so late hath passed the lips of heaven almighty thou to me thy thoughts wast wont i mine to thee was wont to impart both waking we were one how then can now thy sleep dissent new laws thou seest imposed new laws from him who reigns new minds may raise in us who serve new counsels to debate what doubtful may ensue more in this place to utter is not safe assemble thou of all those myriads which we lead the chief tell them that by command ere yet dim night her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste and all who under me their banners wave homeward with flying march where we possess the quarters of the north there to prepare fit entertainment to receive our king the great messiah and his new commands who speedily through all the hierarchies intends to pass triumphant and give laws so spake the false archngel and infused bad influence into the unwary breast of his associate he together calls or several one by one the regent powers under him regent tells as he was taught that the most high commanding now ere night now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven the great hierarchal standard was to move tells the suggested cause and casts between ambiguous words and jealousies to sound or taint integrity but all obeyed the wonted signal and superiour voice of their great potentate for great indeed his name and high was his degree in heaven his countenance as the morningtar that guides the starry flock allured them and with lies drew after him the third part of heaven host mean while the eternal eye whose sight discerns abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount and from within the golden lamps that burn nightly before him saw without their light rebellion rising saw in whom how spread among the sons of morn what multitudes were banded to oppose his high decree and smiling to his only son thus said son thou in whom my glory i behold in full resplendence heir of all my might nearly it now concerns us to be sure of our omnipotence and with what arms we mean to hold what anciently we claim of deity or empire such a foe is rising who intends to erect his throne equal to ours throughout the spacious north nor so content hath in his thought to try in battle what our power is or our right let us advise and to this hazard draw with speed what force is left and all employ in our defence lest unawares we lose this our high place our sanctuary our hill to whom the son with calm aspect and clear lightning divine ineffable serene made answer mighty father thou thy foes justly hast in derision and secure laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain matter to me of glory whom their hate illustrates when they see all regal power given me to quell their pride and in event know whether i be dextrous to subdue thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven so spake the son but satan with his powers far was advanced on winged speed an host innumerable as the stars of night or stars of morning dewrops which the sun impearls on every leaf and every flower regions they passed the mighty regencies of seraphim and potentates and thrones in their triple degrees regions to which all thy dominion adam is no more than what this garden is to all the earth and all the sea from one entire globose stretched into longitude which having passed at length into the limits of the north they came and satan to his royal seat high on a hill far blazing as a mount raised on a mount with pyramids and towers from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold the palace of great lucifer so call that structure in the dialect of men interpreted which not long after he affecting all equality with god in imitation of that mount whereon messiah was declared in sight of heaven the mountain of the congregation called for thither he assembled all his train pretending so commanded to consult about the great reception of their king thither to come and with calumnious art of counterfeited truth thus held their ears thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers if these magnifick titles yet remain not merely titular since by decree another now hath to himself engrossed all power and us eclipsed under the name of king anointed for whom all this haste of midnightarch and hurried meeting here this only to consult how we may best with what may be devised of honours new receive him coming to receive from us kneeribute yet unpaid prostration vile too much to one but double how endured to one and to his image now proclaimed but what if better counsels might erect our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke will ye submit your necks and choose to bend the supple knee ye will not if i trust to know ye right or if ye know yourselves natives and sons of heaven possessed before by none and if not equal all yet free equally free for orders and degrees jar not with liberty but well consist who can in reason then or right assume monarchy over such as live by right his equals if in power and splendour less in freedom equal or can introduce law and edict on us who without law err not much less for this to be our lord and look for adoration to the abuse of those imperial titles which assert our being ordained to govern not to serve thus far his bold discourse without controul had audience when among the seraphim abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored the deity and divine commands obeyed stood up and in a flame of zeal severe the current of his fury thus opposed o argument blasphemous false and proud words which no ear ever to hear in heaven expected least of all from thee ingrate in place thyself so high above thy peers canst thou with impious obloquy condemn the just decree of god pronounced and sworn that to his only son by right endued with regal scepter every soul in heaven shall bend the knee and in that honour due confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest flatly unjust to bind with laws the free and equal over equals to let reign one over all with unsucceeded power shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute with him the points of liberty who made thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven such as he pleased and circumscribed their being yet by experience taught we know how good and of our good and of our dignity how provident he is how far from thought to make us less bent rather to exalt our happy state under one head more near united but to grant it thee unjust that equal over equals monarch reign thyself though great and glorious dost thou count or all angelick nature joined in one equal to him begotten son by whom as by his word the mighty father made all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven by him created in their bright degrees crowned them with glory and to their glory named thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers essential powers nor by his reign obscured but more illustrious made since he the head one of our number thus reduced becomes his laws our laws all honour to him done returns our own cease then this impious rage and tempt not these but hasten to appease the incensed father and the incensed son while pardon may be found in time besought so spake the fervent angel but his zeal none seconded as out of season judged or singular and rash whereat rejoiced the apostate and more haughty thus replied that we were formed then sayest thou and the work of secondary hands by task transferred from father to his son strange point and new doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw when this creation was rememberest thou thy making while the maker gave thee being we know no time when we were not as now know none before us selfegot selfaised by our own quickening power when fatal course had circled his full orb the birth mature of this our native heaven ethereal sons our puissance is our own our own right hand shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try who is our equal then thou shalt behold whether by supplication we intend address and to begirt the almighty throne beseeching or besieging this report these tidings carry to the anointed king and fly ere evil intercept thy flight he said and as the sound of waters deep hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause through the infinite host nor less for that the flaming seraph fearless though alone encompassed round with foes thus answered bold o alienate from god o spirit accursed forsaken of all good i see thy fall determined and thy hapless crew involved in this perfidious fraud contagion spread both of thy crime and punishment henceforth no more be troubled how to quit the yoke of god messiah those indulgent laws will not be now vouchsafed other decrees against thee are gone forth without recall that golden scepter which thou didst reject is now an iron rod to bruise and break thy disobedience well thou didst advise yet not for thy advice or threats i fly these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath impendent raging into sudden flame distinguish not for soon expect to feel his thunder on thy head devouring fire then who created thee lamenting learn when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know so spake the seraph abdiel faithful found among the faithless faithful only he among innumerable false unmoved unshaken unseduced unterrified his loyalty he kept his love his zeal nor number nor example with him wrought to swerve from truth or change his constant mind though single from amidst them forth he passed long way through hostile scorn which he sustained superiour nor of violence feared aught and with retorted scorn his back he turned on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed book all night the dreadless angel unpursued through heaven wide champain held his way till morn waked by the circling hours with rosy hand unbarred the gates of light there is a cave within the mount of god fast by his throne where light and darkness in perpetual round lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven grateful vicissitude like day and night light issues forth and at the other door obsequious darkness enters till her hour to veil the heaven though darkness there might well seem twilight here and now went forth the morn such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold empyreal from before her vanished night shot through with orient beams when all the plain covered with thick embattled squadrons bright chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view war he perceived war in procinct and found already known what he for news had thought to have reported gladly then he mixed among those friendly powers who him received with joy and acclamations loud that one that of so many myriads fallen yet one returned not lost on to the sacred hill they led him high applauded and present before the seat supreme from whence a voice from midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard servant of god well done well hast thou fought the better fight who single hast maintained against revolted multitudes the cause of truth in word mightier than they in arms and for the testimony of truth hast borne universal reproach far worse to bear than violence for this was all thy care to stand approved in sight of god though worlds judged thee perverse the easier conquest now remains thee aided by this host of friends back on thy foes more glorious to return than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue by force who reason for their law refuse right reason for their law and for their king messiah who by right of merit reigns go michael of celestial armies prince and thou in military prowess next gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons invincible lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions ranged for fight equal in number to that godless crew rebellious them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault and to the brow of heaven pursuing drive them out from god and bliss into their place of punishment the gulf of tartarus which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receive their fall so spake the sovran voice and clouds began to darken all the hill and smoke to roll in dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud ethereal trumpet from on high an blow at which command the powers militant that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined of union irresistible moved on in silence their bright legions to the sound of instrumental harmony that breathed heroick ardour to adventurous deeds under their godike leaders in the cause of god and his messiah on they move indissolubly firm nor obvious hill nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides their perfect ranks for high above the ground their march was and the passive air upbore their nimble tread as when the total kind of birds in orderly array on wing came summoned over eden to receive their names of thee so over many a tract of heaven they marched and many a province wide tenfold the length of this terrene at last far in the horizon to the north appeared from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched in battailous aspect and nearer view bristled with upright beams innumerable of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields various with boastful argument portrayed the banded powers of satan hasting on with furious expedition for they weened that selfame day by fight or by surprise to win the mount of god and on his throne to set the envier of his state the proud aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain in the mid way though strange to us it seemed at first that angel should with angel war and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet so oft in festivals of joy and love unanimous as sons of one great sire hymning the eternal father but the shout of battle now began and rushing sound of onset ended soon each milder thought high in the midst exalted as a god the apostate in his sunright chariot sat idol of majesty divine enclosed with flaming cherubim and golden shields then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now wixt host and host but narrow space was left a dreadful interval and front to front presented stood in terrible array of hideous length before the cloudy van on the rough edge of battle ere it joined satan with vast and haughty strides advanced came towering armed in adamant and gold abdiel that sight endured not where he stood among the mightiest bent on highest deeds and thus his own undaunted heart explores o heaven that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realty remain not wherefore should not strength and might there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove where boldest though to fight unconquerable his puissance trusting in the almighty aid i mean to try whose reason i have tried unsound and false nor is it aught but just that he who in debate of truth hath won should win in arms in both disputes alike victor though brutish that contest and foul when reason hath to deal with force yet so most reason is that reason overcome so pondering and from his armed peers forth stepping opposite halfay he met his daring foe at this prevention more incensed and thus securely him defied proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached the highth of thy aspiring unopposed the throne of god unguarded and his side abandoned at the terrour of thy power or potent tongue fool not to think how vain against the omnipotent to rise in arms who out of smallest things could without end have raised incessant armies to defeat thy folly or with solitary hand reaching beyond all limit at one blow unaided could have finished thee and whelmed thy legions under darkness but thou seest all are not of thy train there be who faith prefer and piety to god though then to thee not visible when i alone seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent from all my sect thou seest now learn too late how few sometimes may know when thousands err whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour of my revenge first sought for thou returnest from flight seditious angel to receive thy merited reward the first assay of this right hand provoked since first that tongue inspired with contradiction durst oppose a third part of the gods in synod met their deities to assert who while they feel vigour divine within them can allow omnipotence to none but well thou comest before thy fellows ambitious to win from me some plume that thy success may show destruction to the rest this pause between unanswered lest thou boas to let thee know at first i thought that liberty and heaven to heavenly souls had been all one but now i see that most through sloth had rather serve ministring spirits trained up in feast and song such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of heaven servility with freedom to contend as both their deeds compared this day shall prove to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find of erring from the path of truth remote unjustly thou depravest it with the name of servitude to serve whom god ordains or nature god and nature bid the same when he who rules is worthiest and excels them whom he governs this is servitude to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled against his worthier as thine now serve thee thyself not free but to thyself enthralled yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve in heaven god ever blest and his divine behests obey worthiest to be obeyed yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight this greeting on thy impious crest receive so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sight nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee his massy spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines amazement seised the rebel thrones but greater rage to see thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout presage of victory and fierce desire of battle whereat michael bid sound the archngel trumpet through the vast of heaven it sounded and the faithful armies rung hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze the adverse legions nor less hideous joined the horrid shock now storming fury rose and clamour such as heard in heaven till now was never arms on armour clashing brayed horrible discord and the madding wheels of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise of conflict over head the dismal hiss of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew and flying vaulted either host with fire so under fiery cope together rushed both battles main with ruinous assault and inextinguishable rage all heaven resounded and had earth been then all earth had to her center shook what wonder when millions of fierce encountering angels fought on either side the least of whom could wield these elements and arm him with the force of all their regions how much more of power army against army numberless to raise dreadful combustion warring and disturb though not destroy their happy native seat had not the eternal king omnipotent from his strong hold of heaven high overuled and limited their might though numbered such as each divided legion might have seemed a numerous host in strength each armed hand a legion led in fight yet leader seemed each warriour single as in chief expert when to advance or stand or turn the sway of battle open when and when to close the ridges of grim war no thought of flight none of retreat no unbecoming deed that argued fear each on himself relied as only in his arm the moment lay of victory deeds of eternal fame were done but infinite for wide was spread that war and various sometimes on firm ground a standing fight then soaring on main wing tormented all the air all air seemed then conflicting fire long time in even scale the battle hung till satan who that day prodigious power had shown and met in arms no equal ranging through the dire attack of fighting seraphim confused at length saw where the sword of michael smote and felled squadrons at once with huge twoanded sway brandished aloft the horrid edge came down wideasting such destruction to withstand he hasted and opposed the rocky orb of tenfold adamant his ample shield a vast circumference at his approach the great archngel from his warlike toil surceased and glad as hoping here to end intestine war in heaven the archoe subdued or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown and visage all inflamed first thus began author of evil unknown till thy revolt unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest these acts of hateful strife hateful to all though heaviest by just measure on thyself and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed heaven blessed peace and into nature brought misery uncreated till the crime of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled thy malice into thousands once upright and faithful now proved false but think not here to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss brooks not the works of violence and war hence then and evil go with thee along thy offspring to the place of evil hell thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils ere this avenging sword begin thy doom or some more sudden vengeance winged from god precipitate thee with augmented pain so spake the prince of angels to whom thus the adversary nor think thou with wind of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these to flight or if to fall but that they rise unvanquished easier to transact with me that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats to chase me hence err not that so shall end the strife which thou callest evil but we style the strife of glory which we mean to win or turn this heaven itself into the hell thou fablest here however to dwell free if not to reign mean while thy utmost force and join him named almighty to thy aid i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh they ended parle and both addressed for fight unspeakable for who though with the tongue of angels can relate or to what things liken on earth conspicuous that may lift human imagination to such highth of godlike power for likest gods they seemed stood they or moved in stature motion arms fit to decide the empire of great heaven now waved their fiery swords and in the air made horrid circles two broad suns their shields blazed opposite while expectation stood in horrour from each hand with speed retired where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng and left large field unsafe within the wind of such commotion such as to set forth great things by small if nature concord broke among the constellations war were sprung two planets rushing from aspect malign of fiercest opposition in mid sky should combat and their jarring spheres confound together both with next to almighty arm upifted imminent one stroke they aimed that might determine and not need repeat as not of power at once nor odds appeared in might or swift prevention but the sword of michael from the armoury of god was given him tempered so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending and in half cut sheer nor staid but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared all his right side then satan first knew pain and writhed him to and fro convolved so sore the griding sword with discontinuous wound passed through him but the ethereal substance closed not long divisible and from the gash a stream of necturous humour issuing flowed sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed and all his armour stained ere while so bright forthwith on all sides to his aid was run by angels many and strong who interposed defence while others bore him on their shields back to his chariot where it stood retired from off the files of war there they him laid gnashing for anguish and despite and shame to find himself not matchless and his pride humbled by such rebuke so far beneath his confidence to equal god in power yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout vital in every part not as frail man in entrails heart of head liver or reins cannot but by annihilating die nor in their liquid texture mortal wound receive no more than can the fluid air all heart they live all head all eye all ear all intellect all sense and as they please they limb themselves and colour shape or size assume as likes them best condense or rare mean

him bound threatened nor from the holy one of heaven refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon down cloven to the waist with shattered arms and uncouth pain fled bellowing on each wing uriel and raphael his vaunting foe though huge and in a rock of diamond armed vanquished adramelech and asmadai two potent thrones that to be less than gods disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy the atheist crew but with redoubled blow ariel and arioch and the violence of ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew i might relate of thousands and their names eternize here on earth but those elect angels contented with their fame in heaven seek not the praise of men the other sort in might though wonderous and in acts of war nor of renown less eager yet by doom cancelled from heaven and sacred memory nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell for strength from truth divided and from just illaudable nought merits but dispraise and ignominy yet to glory aspires vainlorious and through infamy seeks fame therefore eternal silence be their doom and now their mightiest quelled the battle
