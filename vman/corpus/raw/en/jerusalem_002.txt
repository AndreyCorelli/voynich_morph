syria and assigned that of jerusalem and palestine to a turkish chief named urtuk ibn eksek who remained in authority until a urtuk was succeeded by his two sons elgh z and sukm n who ruled jerusalem until the assassination of tutush at damascus in a taking advantage of the disturbances which followed upon this event the fatimite caliph of egypt el most a la billah sent his general afdhal el jem with a large force into syria damascus yielded without a blow in the month of july and syria and palestine remained for some time afterwards in the hands of the egyptian government chapter the christian pilgrims dulce mihi cruciari parva vis doloris est malo mori quam f dari major vis amoris est hymn attributed to st augustine at what period in the history of christianity began the practice of going on pilgrimage it is difficult to decide probably the first places held sacred were those of local martyrs and confessors to the faith every part of the civilised world had these in abundance there was not a village where some saint had not fallen a victim to persecution not a town which could not boast of its roll of martyrs when the day of persecution was over and stories of miracles and wonderful cures at holy shrines began to grow it was natural that the minds of a credulous age should turn to the holiest place of all the city of jerusalem it had so turned even before the invention of the holy cross for helena herself was on a pilgrimage when she made her discovery but the story noised abroad the building by constantine of the church of the martyrdom and the immediate fixing without any hesitation of all the sacred sites recorded in the new testament were the causes of a vast increase in the number of pilgrims who every year flocked to jerusalem and then flames which burst from the foundations of the temple when julian made his vain attempt to rebuild it were reported throughout christendom and added to the general enthusiasm for the feeble faith of the nations had to be supported by miracles ever new moreover the dangers of the way were diminished more countries day by day became christian the pagans who had formerly intercepted and killed the pilgrims on the road were now themselves in hiding the christians destroyed the old shrines and temples wherever they found them and all the roads were open to the pious worshipper who only desired to pray at the sacred places but the passion for pilgrimages grew to so great an extent and was accompanied by so many dangers to virtue and good manners that attempts were made from time to time to check it augustine teaches that god is approached better by love than by long travel gregory of nyssa points out that pilgrimage of itself avails nothing and jerome declares that heaven may be reached as easily from britain as from jerusalem that an innumerable throng of saints never saw the city and that the sacred places themselves have been polluted by the images of idols but this teaching was in vain going on pilgrimage served too many ends and gratified too many desires piety no doubt in greater or less degree had always something to do with a resolve to undertake a long and painful journey but there were other motives the curious man by becoming a pilgrim was enabled to see the world the lazy man to escape work the adventurous man to find adventures the credulous and imaginative man to fill his mind with stories the vain man to gratify his vanity and procure lifeong honour at the cost of some peril and fatigue the sincere to wipe off his sins and all alike believed that they were doing an act meritorious in itself and pleasing in the sight of heaven the doctors of the church protested but in vain indeed they often went themselves st porphyry afterwards bishop of gaza was one of those who went he had betaken himself to the thebaid at the age of twenty to become a hermit there after five years of austerities he became seized with an irresistible desire to see jerusalem afflicted with a painful disorder and hardly able to hold himself upright he managed to crawl across the deserts to the city as soon as he arrived there he sent his companion back to thessalonica his native place with injunctions to sell all that he had and distribute the proceeds among the faithful and then he laid himself down to die mark departed what was his astonishment on returning his mission accomplished to find his friend restored to health porphyry went no more to the thebaid probably but a dull place at best even for a hermit and betaking himself to a handicraft he preached the gospel and became a bishop st jerome himself in spite of his protests went to palestine accompanied by eusebius of cremona the voice of calumny had attacked jerome in revenge for his exposure of the sins and follies of the day and he was pleased to leave rome the two future saints landed at antioch and after seeing jerusalem went on to bethlehem and thence to the thebaid where they solaced themselves with admiring the austerities of the selformentors the hermits there returning thence to bethlehem they resolved on selling their property and forming a monastery in that town this they accomplished by the assistance of paula and eudoxia two noble ladies mother and daughter who followed them to palestine and passed their lives like jerome himself under a rigid rule of prayer and labour paula died in bethlehem her daughter and jerome less happy were turned out of their peaceful retreat by a band of arabs bribed we are told by the heretics in jerusalem who burned and pillaged the monastic houses dispersed the monks and nuns and drove the venerable jerome then past the age of seventy years to a bed from which he never rose again the story of the pilgrimage of paula is useful because it shows that the multiplication of the sacred sites was not due entirely to the invention of later times at sarea she saw the house of cornelius the centurion turned into a church and here also was the house of saint philip and the chambers of his four virgin daughters prophetesses on mount zion she saw the column where our lord was scourged still stained with his blood and supporting the gallery of a church she saw too the place where the holy spirit descended on the apostles at bethphage they showed her the sepulchre of lazarus and the house of mary and martha on mount ephraim she saw the tombs of joshua and eleazar at shechem the well of jacob and the tombs of the twelve patriarchs and at samaria the tombs of elisha and john the baptist hither were brought those possessed with devils that they might be exorcised and paula herself was an eyeitness of the miraculous cure effected with regard to miracles indeed antoninus martyr to whose testimony on the site of the church of the holy sepulchre we have referred in another place relates many which he himself pretends to have seen if you bring oil near the true cross he says it will boil of its own accord and must be quickly removed or it will all escape at certain times a star from heaven rests on the cross he tells us too that there is on sinai an idol fixed there by the infidels in white marble which on days of ceremony changes colour and becomes quite black footnote see appendix the impending fall of the empire and the invasion of the hordes of barbarians proved but a slight check to the swarms of pilgrims for the barbarians finding that these unarmed men and women were completely harmless respected their helplessness and allowed them to pass unmolested when as happened shortly after their settlement in italy and the west they were gradually themselves brought within the pale of the christian faith they made laws which enforced the protection and privileges of pilgrims these laws were not it is true always obeyed the route was carefully laid down for the pilgrims by numerous itineraries the most important of which is that called the itinerary of the bordeaux pilgrim the author starts from bordeaux perhaps because it is his own city perhaps because it was then the most considerable town in the west of europe he passes through france by auch toulouse narbonne thence to beziers n mes and arles at arles he turns northwards and passes through avignon orange and valence when he again turns eastwards to diez embrun and brian on thence he crosses the alps and stops at susa in italy he passes through the towns of turin pavia milan not because milan was on his way but because it would be a pity to lose the opportunity of seeing this splendid cit to brescia verona and aquileia a town subsequently destroyed by attila at the head of the gulf of trieste crossing the italian alps he arrives at the frontiers of the empire of the east his course lies next through illyria styria and along the northern banks of the river drave which he leaves after a time and follows the course of the save to its confluence with the danube at belgrade he now follows the danube until he comes to the great roman road which leads him to nissa thence still by the road to philippopolis heraclia and constantinople across asia minor he passes through nicomedia nic a across what is now anatolia to ancyra thence to tyana and tarsus from tarsus he goes to iskanderoon thence to antioch tortosa tripoli along the roman road which lay by the syrian seaoar beyrout sidon tyre acre and sarea here he leaves the direct and shortest way to jerusalem in order first to visit the jordan and other places it is instructive to follow the route of the pilgrim because this was doubtless the road taken by the hundreds who every year flocked to jerusalem and because as we shall see nearly the same road was subsequently taken by the crusaders palestine during some centuries enjoyed a period of profound peace during which the sword was sheathed and no voice of war save that of a foray of arabs was heard in the land thither retreated all those who like saint jerome were indisposed altogether to quit the world like the hermits of egypt but yet sought to find some quiet spot where they could study and worship undisturbed thither came the monks turned out of africa by genseric and when belisarius in his turn overcame the barbarians thither were brought back the spoils of the temple which titus had taken from jerusalem nor was the repose of the country seriously disturbed during the long interval between the revolt of barcochebas and the invasion of the persians under chosroes but after heraclius had restored their city to the christians a worse enemy even than chosroes was at hand and when caliph omar became the master of jerusalem the quiet old days were gone for ever the mohammedans were better masters than the persians they reverenced the name of jesus they spared the church of the sepulchre they even promised to protect the christians but promises made by the caliph were not always observed by his fanatic soldiers the christians were pillaged and robbed they were insulted and abused they were forced to pay a heavy tribute forbidden to appear on horseback or to wear arms obliged to wear a leathern girdle to denote their nation nor were they even permitted to elect their own bishops and clergy the pilgrims did not in consequence of these persecutions become fewer to the other excitements which called them to the holy land was now added the chance of martyrdom and the records of the next two centuries are filled with stories of their sufferings which appear to have been grossly exaggerated at the hands of the muslim masters of the city if the pilgrim returned safely to his home there was some comfort for his relations deprived of the glory of having a martyr in the family in being able to relate how he had been buffeted and spat upon to this period belong the pilgrimages of arnulphus and antoninus that of the former is valuable inasmuch as not only his own account has been preserved but even the map which he drew up from memory bede made use of his narrative which was taken down by the abbot adamnanus who gave arnulphus hospitality when he was shipwrecked in the hebrides on his return so extensive was the desire to pilgrimize so many people deserted their towns and villages leaving their work undone and their families neglected while disorders multiplied on the road and virtue was subjected to so many more temptations on the way to the holy land than were encountered at home that the church about the ninth century interfered and assumed the power to grant or to withhold the privilege of pilgrimage the candidate had first to satisfy the bishop of his diocese of his moral character that he went away with the full consent of his friends and relations and that he was actuated by no motives of curiosity indolence or a desire to obtain in other lands a greater licence and freedom of action if these points were not answered satisfactorily permission was withheld and if the applicant belonged to one of the monastic orders he found it far more difficult to obtain the required authority for it had been only too well proved that in assuming the pilgrim s robe the monks were often only embracing an opportunity to return to the world again but when all was satisfactory and the bishop satisfied as to the personal piety of the applicant the church dismissed him on his journey with a service and a benediction he was solemnly invested with the scrip and staff he put on the long woollen robe which formed the chief part of his dress the clergy and his own friends accompanied him to the boundaries of his parish and there after giving him a letter or a passport which ensured him hospitality so long as he was in christian countries they sent him on his way in the name of god ran the commendatory letter we would have your highness or holiness to know that the bearer of the present letters our brother has asked our permission to go peaceably on pilgrimage to jerusalem either for his own sins or to pray for our preservation thereupon we have given him these present letters in which we salute you and pray you for the love of god and saint peter to receive him as your guest to be useful to him in going and coming back so that he may return in safety to his house and as is your good custom make him pass happy days may god the eternal king protect you and keep you in his kingdom thus provided the pilgrim found hostels open for him and every castle and monastery ready to receive him long and weary his journey may have been but it could not have been tedious to him with eyes to see and observe when every city was a sort of new world when a new country lay beyond every hill and new manners and customs were marked on every day the perils and dangers of the way were not until the mohammedan conquest nor indeed after it until the time of hakem very great true the woods harboured wild beasts but the pilgrims travelled in bands and there were robbers but these did not rob those who had nothing the principal dangers were those of which they knew nothing the diseases due to malaria exposure suntroke fatigue and change of climate these and not the turks were the chief enemies of pilgrims and in spite of these known and unknown dangers there cannot be a doubt that the pilgrimage to syria was a long series of new and continually changing wonders and surprises the church which blessed the pilgrim also celebrated the act of pilgrimage and a service has been preserved which was performed on the second sunday after easter in the cathedral of rouen of this the following is an abridgment in the nave of the church was erected a fort castellum representing that house at emmaus where the two travellers entered and broke bread with christ at the appointed time two priests of the second seats appointed for the day came forth from the vestry singing the hymn which begins jesu nostra redemptio they were to be dressed in tunics et desuper cappis transversum were to have long flowing hair and beards and were each to carry a staff and scrip singing this hymn and slowly marching down the right aisle they came to the western porch when they put themselves at the head of the procession of choristers waiting for them and all began together to sing nos tuo vultu saties then the priest for the day robed in alb and surplice barefooted carrying a cross on his right shoulder advanced to meet them and suddenly standing before them asked what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad to which the two pilgrims replied art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days footnote we take the words of the authorized version what things asked the priest concerning jesus of nazareth they replied with the words which follow oh fools said the priest and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and then feigning to retire the priest would there have left them but they held him back and pointing to the castellum entreated him to enter singing abide with us for it is towards evening and the day is far spent then singing another hymn they led him to the fort of emmaus when they entered and sat down at a table already spread for supper here the priest brake bread sitting between them and being recognised by this act for the lord suddenly vanished out of their sight the pilgrims pretending to be stupefied arose and sung sorrowfully lamentabiliter alleluia with the verse did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures singing this twice they walked to the pulpit where they sang the verse dic nobis maria after this another priest dressed in a dalmatic and surplice with head muffled up like a woman came to them and sang sepulcrum christi angelicos testes he then took up a cloth from one place and a second from another place and threw them before the great door of the choir and then let him sing christ has risen and let the choir chaunt the two other verses which follow and let the women and the pilgrims retire within and the memory of this act being thus recalled let the procession return to the choir and the vespers be finished these ceremonies were not of course designed to meet the case of pilgrimages undertaken by way of penance these were of two kinds minores peregrationes which were pilgrimages on foot to local shrines such as later on that of st thomasecket for instance or majores to rome or jerusalem the latter of which frotmond s pilgrimage which will be described further on is an example were for murder sacrilege or for any other great crime one of the rules as regards a murderer was as follows let a chain be made of the very sword with which the crime was committed and let the neck arms and body of the criminal be bound round with this chain thus let him be driven from his native country and wander whither the pope shall direct him till by long prayer he obtain the divine mercy the roads were crowded with these miserable wretches limping along to their shrines only the more distinguished either in rank or enormity of offence were ordered to go to palestine the custom was carried on to comparatively late times and it was not till the fourteenth century that a law was passed restraining the practice better is it that these criminals should remain all together in one place and there work out the sentence imposed upon them by the church so long was it before justice was taken out of the hands of the church it could not have added greatly to the delights of travelling in these days occasionally to meet bands of these wretches toiling painfully along half naked and dragging the weight of their chains while they implored the prayers and alms of the passersy but the triumph of the pilgrim not the crimina was in coming home again bearing a palm branch in his hands as a sign that he had seen the sacred places he narrated his adventures and gathered those at least that were poor alms in plenty arrived at his native village the palm branch was solemnly offered at the altar and the pilgrim returned to his home to spend the rest of his life in telling of the miracles he had seen wrought not all however came home so long as the pilgrim passed the rough lands where his passport was recognised all was easy enough he got food to eat and a bed to sleep in but he sometimes came to places if he went by way of constantinople where there were no monasteries and where his passport proved useless the ferocious bulgarians or the treacherous croats in theory friendly and by profession christian sometimes proved cuthroats and robbers the mohammedans though they acknowledged the harmlessness of the crowds that flocked about the gates could not avoid showing the contempt they naturally felt for those who refused to think as they thought themselves when the pilgrims arrived at the city they could not enter without payment and often they had no money to pay and if they were able to pay for admission they were not exempt from the insults of the saracens who sometimes pleased themselves with interrupting the sacred office trampling on the vessels of the eucharist and even scourging the priests but these persecutions belong to a somewhat later time than we have yet arrived at about the same time as the pilgrimage of arnulf took place that of willibald willibald afterwards bishop of eichst dt was an englishman by birth he was dedicated at an early age by his father to the monastic life and received a pious and careful education arrived at the period of manhood he persuaded his father his sister walpurga and his brother wunebald accompanied by a large party of servants and followers to undertake a pilgrimage to palestine in italy his father died and his brother and sister left him and returned to england willibald with a few companions went on eastward at emessa they were detained but not harmed by the emir but released through the intercession of a spanish merchant they proceeded to jerusalem willibald visited the city no less than four times he was once we are told miraculously cured of blindness by praying at the church where the cross had been found probably he had contracted an ophthalmia of which he recovered in jerusalem about the year charlemagne conceived the idea of sending a special embassy to the caliph har n er rasch he sent three ambassadors two of whom died on the way the third isaac the jew returned after five years absence bearing the presents of the great caliph and accompanied by his envoys the presents consisted of an elephant which caused huge surprise to the people carved ivory incense a clock and the keys of the church of the holy sepulchre charlemagne sent in return white and green robes and a pack of his best hounds he also astonished the caliph s envoys by the magnificence of his church ceremonials charlemagne established a hostel at jerusalem for the use of pilgrims and continued to cultivate friendly relations with haroun the latter for his part inculcated a toleration far enough indeed from the spirit of his creed and ordered that the christians should not be molested in the exercise of their worship one of the most singular histories of the time is that already alluded to of the pilgrimage of frotmond at the death of their father frotmond and his brothers proceeded to divide the property which he left behind a greatncle an ecclesiastic in some way interfered with the partition of the estates and roused them to so great a fury that they killed him but immediately afterwards struck with horror at the crime they had committed they betook themselves to the court of king lothaire and professed their penitence and resolution to perform any penance in the midst of an assembly of prelates the guilty brothers were bound with chains clothed with hair shirts and with their bodies and hair covered with ashes were enjoined thus to visit the sacred places they went first to rome where benedict received them and gave them letters of recommendation thence they went by sea to palestine and spent four years in jerusalem practising every kind of austerity and mortification thence because their penance was not hard enough they went to the theba in egypt where they remained two years more among hermits the most rigid and selformentors the most cruel they then wandered along the shores of the mediterranean to carthage where was the tomb of saint cyprian after seven years of suffering they returned to rome and begged for the pardon of the church it was in vain they had murdered a churchman they were of noble birth and the example must be striking and once more they set off for a renewal of their weary travels in lands already familiar to them this time after revisiting jerusalem they went north to galilee and thence south to sinai where they remained for three years again they returned to rome and again implored the pardon of the pope again to be refused and then tired we may suppose of sufferings which seemed useless and fatigues without an object they bent their steps homewards at rennes the eldest brother died unforgiven frotmond turned his steps once more towards rome but on the way he was met by an aged man return said he to the sanctuary which thou hast quitted i order thee in the name of the lord it is there that absolution waits thee by the mercy of god he turned back the weight of his chains had bent him double he could not stand upright the sores which the iron had caused were putrefying and the time of his deliverance from the earth seemed to draw nigh in the night the same old man appeared again accompanied by two fair youths master said one it is time to restore health to this pilgrim not yet replied the old man but when the monks shall rise to chant the vigils at the hour of vigils frotmond crawled with the rest into the church there he fell asleep and while he slept the old man appeared again and tore off the chains which fell to the ground and by the noise of their falling awakened frotmond they placed him in a bed and in three days he was well and sound again miraculously cured of his festering sores but he was not yet satisfied and was preparing for a third pilgrimage when he fell ill and died the old man and the dream were they his disguise for a resolution to endure no more the tyranny of the church or were they the invention of a later time and of some bolder spirit than the rest who would not allow that to rome alone belonged the power of binding and of loosing with the passion for pilgrimages grew up the desire to find and to possess relics these towards the end of the tenth century when a general feeling that the end of the world was approaching caused the building of new churches everywhere and the reconstruction of old ones were found in great abundance thanks to certain revelations and some signs says raoul the bald we succeeded in finding holy relics long hidden from human eyes the saints themselves by word of god appeared to the faithful and reclaimed an earthly resurrection the revelations began at sensuronne in burgundy where they still show a goodly collection of holy bones including the finger with which luke wrote his gospel and the chair in which he sat while he was writing it archbishop leuteric was so fortunate as to find a piece of moses rod with this many miracles were wrought almost every returning pilgrim had something which he had either picked up or bought or been instructed in a vision of the night to bring home with him this treasure he deposited in the parish church pious people set it with pearls and precious stones or enclosed it in a golden casket stories grew up about it sick people resorted to the place to be cured and one more legend was added to the innumerable fables of relics it is useful to remember as regards the pilgrimages the finding of relics and the strange heresies of the time that it was a period of great religious excitement as well as of profound ignorance nothing was too wonderful to be believed no one so wise as not to be credulous no one had actually seen a miracle with his own eyes but everybody knew of countless miracles seen by his neighbour s eyes meantime the toleration granted to the christians through the wisdom of har n er rash continued pretty well undisturbed for many years and life at least was tolerably safe though insult might be probable and even certain commerce the great civiliser had its own part too in keeping the peace between christian and infidel on the fifteenth of every september there was held a kind of fair in jerusalem thither flocked merchants from pisa venice genoa and marseilles eager to satisfy at once their desire for gain and their desire to obtain a reputation for piety and for a short time jerusalem seems to have served as the chief emporium whither the east sent her treasures to sell them to the west the objects in demand at this fair were those which were luxuries to the west cloves nutmegs and mace from india pepper ginger and frankincense by way of aden silks from india and china sugar from syria dates cassia and flax from egypt and from the same country quicksilver coral and metals glass from tyre almonds saffron and mastic with rich stuffs and weapons from damascus and dyed stuffs from jerusalem itself when the jews had a monopoly for which they paid a heavy tax for dyeing footnote albert of aix speaks of the crusaders first coming upon the sugarane the people sucked sweet reeds which were found in abundance in the meadows called zucra this reed is grown with the greatest care every year at the time of harvest the natives crush it in mortars and collect the juice in vessels when they leave it till it hardens and becomes white like snow or salt footnote see moires de acad mie des inscriptions de guignes sur tat du commerce des fran ois dans le levant avant les croisades gold in the west was scarce and the trade was carried on either by exchange or by means of silver the chief traders were the italians but the french especially through the port of marseilles were great merchants and we find guy de lusignan king of jerusalem according to french traders singular privileges and immunities solely in reward for their assistance at saint jean acre there can be no doubt that this trade had a great deal to do with pilgrimages the two motives which most of all persuade men cheerfully to incur danger are religion and gain when were the two more closely allied than in those comparatively peaceful times when jerusalem was open both to worshippers and traders with his money bags tied to his girdle the merchant could at once perform the sacred rites which as most believed made him secure of heaven and could purchase those eastern luxuries for which the princes of the west were ready to pay so dearly a state of things however so favourable to the general welfare of the world could not be expected to last very long luxury and sensuality destroyed the abassides and their great kingdom fell to pieces then nicephorus phocas emperor of constantinople saw in the weakness of the mohammedans the opportunity of the christians with wisdom worthy of mohammed he resolved on giving his invasion a religious character and endeavoured to persuade the clergy to proclaim a holy war these however refused to help him religion and the slaughter of the enemy were not to be confounded and the great army of nicephorus which might have been made irresistible was disheartened for want of that spirit which makes every soldier believe himself a possible martyr the greek emperor took antioch but was prevented by death from following up his success while the patriarch of jerusalem was condemned to the flames on suspicion of having corresponded with the greeks but before the taking of antioch troubles had befallen the christians the church of the holy sepulchre was greatly injured by the fanatics who took every opportunity of troubling their victims when it had been restored the patriarch was cast into prison on a charge of having built his church higher than the mosque of omar he got off by a singular artifice an old mohammedan offered for a consideration to show him a way of escape his offer being accepted he simply told the patriarch to deny the fact and call on them to prove it the plan succeeded the charge though perfectly true could not be proved and the patriarch escaped footnote williams s holy city vol i at this period the massacre of an immense number of mohammedan pilgrims on their way to mecca led to the substitution for thirty years of jerusalem for mecca footnote see chap the city thus had two streams of pilgrims one to the holy rock the mosque of omar and the other to the holy cave the sepulchre of christ nicephorus being murdered john zimisces his successor and murderer followed up his victories he easily gained possession of damascus and syria and reduced to submission all the cities of palestine he did not however enter jerusalem to which he sent a garrison death interrupted his victorious career and islam once more began to recover its forces the fatemite caliphs who had succeeded in establishing themselves in egypt made themselves masters of jerusalem and though for a short time the christians were treated rather as allies and friends than as a conquered people the accession of hakem was an event which renewed all former troubles with more than their former weight footnote after having murdered nicephorus he was himself poisoned by basil his grand chamberlain who succeeded him in the greek empire murder seems to have formed the strongest title to the crown he ordered that jews should wear blue robes and christians black and in order to mark them yet more distinctively that both should wear black turbans christians moreover were at first ordered to wear wooden stirrups with crosses round their necks while the jews were compelled to carry round pieces of wood to signify the head of the golden calf which they had worshipped in the desert the destruction of the church of the holy sepulchre by this madman has been already alluded to for another account of the same transaction and of the causes which led to it we are indebted to raoul the bald glabe who describes the excitement produced in europe by this act in the year he says though his date appears to be wrong by one year the church of the sepulchre was entirely destroyed by order of the prince of babylon the devil put it into the heads of the jews to whisper calumnies about the servants of the true religion there were a considerable number of jews in orleans prouder more envious and more audacious than the rest of their nation they suborned a vagabond monk named robert and sent him with secret letters written in the hebrew character and for better preservation enclosed in a stick to the prince of babylon therein they told how if the prince did not make haste to destroy the shrine at which the christians worshipped they would speedily take possession of his kingdom and deprive him of his honours on reading the letter the prince fell into fury and sent to jerusalem soldiers charged with the order to destroy the church from roof to foundation this order was but too well executed and his satellites even tried to break the interior of the sacred sepulchre with their iron hammers but all their efforts were useless a short time after it was known beyond a doubt that the calamity must be imputed to the jews and when their secret was divulged all christendom resolved with one accord to drive out the jews from their territory to the very last they became thus the object of universal execration some were driven out some massacred by the sword some thrown into the sea or given up to different kinds of punishment others devoted themselves to voluntary deaths so that after the just vengeance executed upon them very few could be seen in the roman world these examples of justice were not calculated to inspire a feeling of security in the mind of robert when he came back he began by looking for his accomplices of whom there were still a small number in orleans with them he lived familiarly but he was denounced by a stranger who had made the journey with him and knew perfectly well the object of his mission he is seized scourged and confesses his crime the ministers of the king take him without the city and there in the sight of all the people commit him to the flames nevertheless the fugitive jews began to reappear in the cities and there is no doubt that because some must always exist as a living testimony to their shame and the crime by which they shed the blood of christ god permitted the animosity of the christians to subside however that may be by the divine will maria mother of the emir prince of babylon a very christian princess ordered the church to be rebuilt with square and polished stones the same year and there might have been seen an innumerable crowd of christians running in triumph to jerusalem from all parts of the world and contending with one another in their offerings for the restoration of the house of god footnote if there is any one fact in history which seems absolutely clear and certain it is this that the church of the holy sepulchre was destroyed by command of hakem william of tyre expressly describes the reconstruction of the church raoul as shown above tells how the news of the destruction was received all the arabic historians record the event it was an unlucky day for the jews when robert went on his embassy whatever that was to the east but a renewal of the religious spirit in the west was always attended by a persecution of the jews no story was too incredible to be believed of them no violence and cruelty too much for them when the crusades began almost the first to suffer were the hapless jews and we know how miserable was their situation so long as the crusading spirit lasted even when this was dying out when the christians and the saracens were often firm friends the jews alone shared none of the benefits of toleration to be a descendant of that race by whom christ was crucified was to be subjected to the very wantonness of cruelty and persecution one of the principal sights in jerusalem then as now though the latins have long since given it up was the yearly appearance of the holy fire odolric was witness not only of this but of another and a more unusual miracle for while the people were all waiting for the fire to appear a saracen began to chant in mockery the kyrie eleison and snatching a taper from one of the pilgrims he ran away with it but immediately says raoul he was seized by the devil and began to suffer unimaginable torments the christian who had been robbed regained his taper and the saracen died immediately after in the arms of his friends this example inspired a just terror into the hearts of the infidels and was for the christians a great subject of rejoicing and at that very moment the holy fire burst out from one of the same lamps and ran from one to the other bishop odolric bought the lamp which was first lit for a pound of gold and hung it up in his church at orleans where it cured an infinite number of sick one can easily understand the growth of stories such as that of the stricken saracen an age like the tenth was little disposed to question the truth of a miracle which proved their faith nor was it likely to set against the one saracen who died in torture after insulting the cross the tens of thousands who insulted it with impunity the series of miracles related by raoul and others are told in perfect good faith and believed by those to whom they were related as simply as they were believed by those who told them and we can very well understand how they helped in a time when hardly any other thing would have so helped to maintain the faith of a people coarse rough unlettered and imaginative the destruction of the church of the holy sepulchre the stories spread abroad about the miraculous preservation of the cave and its rebuilding in all served to increase the ardour of pilgrims and there had been another cause already mentioned throughout western christendom a whisper ran that the end of the world was approaching a thousand years had nearly elapsed since the church of christ was founded the second advent of the founder was to happen when this period was accomplished the advent was to take place in palestine happy those who could be present to welcome their lord therefore of all conditions and ranks in life from the lowest to the highest an innumerable multitude of pilgrims thronged to jerusalem and so deep was the feeling that the end of all things was at hand that legal documents were drawn up beginning with the words appropinquante etenim mundi termino et ruinis crebrescentibus jam certa signa manifestantur pertimescens tremendi judicii diem among the best known pilgrims of the last century before the crusades is fulke the black count of anjou he was accused and justly of numerous acts of violence but he had also violated the sanctity of a church and for this pardon was difficult to obtain troubled with phantoms which appeared to him by night the offspring of his own disordered conscience fulke resolved to expiate his sins by a pilgrimage after being nearly shipwrecked on his voyage to syria the tempest appeared to him a special mark of god s displeasure he arrived safely in jerusalem and caused himself to be scourged through the streets crying aloud lord have mercy on a faithless and perjured christian on a sinner wandering far from his own country by a pious fraud he obtained admission to the church of the holy sepulchre and we are told that while praying at the tomb the stone miraculously became soft to his teeth and he bit off a portion of it and brought it triumphantly away returned to his own country fulke built a church at loches in imitation of that at jerusalem tormented still by his conscience he went a second time as a pilgrim to palestine and returning safely again he occupied himself for many years in building monasteries and churches but he could not rest in quiet and resolved for the good of his soul to make a third pilgrimage this he did but died on his way home at metz a very different pilgrim was raymond of plaisance born of poor parents and himself apprenticed to a shoemaker raymond s mind was distracted from the earliest age by the desire to see palestine he disguised his anxiety for a time but it became too strong for him and he fell ill and confessed his thoughts to his mother she a widow resolved to accompany him and they set off together they arrived safely at jerusalem and wept before the sepulchre conceiving we are told a lively desire to end their days there and then this was not to be however they went on to bethlehem thence to jerusalem again and thence homewards on board the ship raymond was seized with an illness and the sailors wanted to throw him overboard thinking according to the usual sailors superstition that a sick man would bring disaster his mother however dissuaded them and he quickly recovered but the mother died herself shortly after landing in italy and raymond went on alone he was met at plaisance by a procession of clergy and choristers and led to the cathedral where he deposited his palm branch sign of successful pilgrimage and then returned to his shoemaking married and lived to a good old age doubtless telling over and over again the stories of his travels and now began those vast pilgrimages when thousands went together the armies of the lord the real precursors of the crusades robert of normandy a like fulke the black anxious to wipe out his sins went accompanied by a great number of barons and knights all barefooted all clothed with the penitential sackcloth all bearing the staff and purse they went by constantinople and through asia minor there robert was seized with an illness and being unable to walk was borne in a litter by saracens tell my people said the duke that you have seen me borne to paradise by devils a speech which shows how far toleration had spread in those days robert found a large number of pilgrims outside the city unable to pay the entrance money he paid for all and after signalizing himself by numerous acts of charity he returned dying on the way in bithynia regretting only that he had not died sooner at the sacred shrine itself to die there indeed was as we have seen in the case of raymond a common prayer the form of words is preserved thou who hast died for us and art buried in this sacred place take pity on our misery and withdraw us from this vale of tears and the christians preserved the story of one lethbald whose prayer was actually answered for he died suddenly in the sight of his companions after crying out three times aloud glory to thee o god sometimes but seldom a sort of missionary spirit would seize a pilgrim and he would try to convert the infidels thus saint macarius of armenia bishop of antioch learned arabic and hebrew and going to jerusalem began to preach to the jews and saracens of course he was beaten and thrown into prison and we need not record the miracles that happened to him therein richard abbot of saint vitou left normandy at the head of seven hundred pilgrims with whom was saint gervinus there are accounts preserved of this pilgrimage which offers little of interest except the miracles which were wrought for richard lietbert in bishop of cambray headed a band of no fewer than three thousand they followed the road which the crusaders were afterwards to take through hungary and bulgaria here many of his men were disheartened and wished to return but be persuaded them to go on they passed into asia minor but only got as far as laodicea where they heard that the church of the sepulchre was finally closed to christians most of the pilgrims set off on their way home lietbert persevered and embarked with a few for jaffa they were shipwrecked on the isle of cyprus again they took ship for jaffa and again they failed being landed again at laodicea after so many disappointments lietbert lost courage and went home again without accomplishing his pilgrimage the most important of all the pilgrimages however was that of the archbishop of mayence accompanied by the bishops of utrecht ramberg and ratisbon and by seven thousand pilgrims of every rank they were not dressed as was the wont of pilgrims in sackcloth but wore their more costly robes the bishops in dress of state and cloth of gold the knights with burnished arms and costly trappings the army for an army it was too well equipped to escape without attack too small to ensure victory in case of attack followed the usual route across asia minor from constantinople it was not however till they were near ramleh almost within sight of jerusalem that the pilgrims were actually attacked and then not by the saracens but by a large troop of arabs whom they attempted at first to repel by blows with their fists many were wounded including the bishop of utrecht they drove off the enemy for the moment with stones and retired to a ruined fort which was fortunately near the spot where they cowered behind the falling walls the arabs came on with shrill cries the christians nearly unarmed rushed out and tore their swords and bucklers from them but they were obliged to fall back and the arabs getting reinforced encamped round the fort to the number of twelve thousand and resolved to starve out the enemy the christians held a hasty council let us urged a priest sacrifice our gold which is all that the infidels want having that they will let us go free this advice was adopted and on a parley being held the chief of the arabs with a small body of seventeen men consented to enter the fort and come to terms the bishop of mayence who was the stateliest and handsomest man among the christians was chosen to speak with him he proposed in return for freedom and safety to hand over to the arabs all the treasure in the hands of the christians it is not for you replied the arab to make terms with your conquerors and taking off his turban as we are told as a modern bedaw would do with his headress under similar circumstances he threw it like a halter round the neck of the bishop the christian prelate was not prepared for a reception so rude and fairly knocked him down with a blow from his fist upon which the knights set upon the whole eighteen arabs and bound them tightly the news of the detention of their chief quickly spreading outside the arab army commenced a furious attack which would have been fatal to the christians but for a stratagem which procured them some little delay for the christians holding swords to the throats of their prisoners promised to fight with their heads if the attack was continued and the chieftain s son in alarm for his father hastened from rank to rank imploring the men to desist and at this juncture arrived the emir of ramleh with troops at sight of whom the arabs turned and fled the arab chieftain remained a prisoner you have delivered us said the emir from our greatest enemies and so with congratulations and in friendship they marched to jerusalem which they entered in a kind of triumph by torchlight with the sound of cymbals and trumpets they were received by the patriarch sophronimus and made the round next day of the sacred places still bearing the marks of the destruction wrought by hakem fifty years before and now approached the period of the first crusade all these pilgrimages were like preparatory and tentative expeditions the final provocations were yet to come which should rouse the christians to unanimous action in the year the city had been taken after holding out till the defenders were in danger of starvation by atsiz the kharesmian and transferred from the fatemite caliph of egypt to the abbaside khalif after the defeat of atsiz at gaza a rebellion was attempted in jerusalem which resulted in the massacre of three thousand of the people atsiz called in tutush brother of melek shah to his assistance tutush came but instead of helping atsiz he arrested and executed him and proceeded to make himself master of syria a turk named ostok was made governor of jerusalem and fresh persecutions began for the christians the turks had now conquered the whole of asia minor too few in numbers to occupy the whole country they held the towns by garrison the effeminate greeks having fallen an easy prey to them but before this event the emperor michael ducas foreseeing the conquest of his country unless the mohammedans were driven back had written to pope gregory imploring the assistance of the western christians and offering to throw down the barriers which separated the two churches gregory quickly matured a complete plan of united action on the part of all the christians the price of the assistance of western europe was to be the submission of the eastern church the conquest of palestine was to be the triumph of rome gerbert had entertained a similar dream but gregory did more than dream he exhorted the christians to unite in the holy war and obtained fifty thousand promises he was himself to head the crusade but other schemes intervened and gregory died without doing anything victor did more than gregory he not only exhorted but persuaded the tuscans venetians and genoese fitted out a fleet fully manned and equipped and sent it against the mohammedans who were now impeding the navigation of the mediterranean a signal triumph was obtained and the conquerors returned laden with spoils from the towns they had captured and burned this was the first united effort of the christians against the saracens and perhaps the most successful of any all then was ripe for the crusade the sword had been already drawn the idea was not a new one letters imploring help had been received from the emperor of the greeks three popes had preached a holy war the sufferings of the christians went on increasing moreover the wickedness of the western church was very great william of tyre declares that virtue and piety were obliged to hide themselves there was no longer any charity any reverence for rank any hesitation at plunging whole countries in war there was no longer any security for property the monasteries themselves were not safe against robbers the very churches were pillaged and the sacred vessels stolen the right of sanctuary was violated the highways were covered with armed brigands chastity economy temperance were regarded as things stupid and worthless the bishops were as dumb dogs who could not bark and the priests were no better than the people the description of william of tyre is vague though heavily charged but there can be no doubt that the times were exceptionally evil crimes common enough in an age distinguished above all by absence of selfestraint and abandonment to unbridled rage would be naturally magnified by a historian who saw in them a reason for the infidel s persecution of pilgrims and an argument for the taking of the cross yet making allowance for every kind of exaggeration it is clear enough that gregory had great mischiefs to contend with and that the awakening of the world s conscience by any means whatever could not but produce a salutary effect the immediate effect of the crusades was the substitution of higher for lower motives the sudden cessation of war the shaming of the clergy into something like purity of life the absorption into the armies of the cross of the men of violence and some temporary alleviation to the sufferings of the poor the hour and the man were both at hand chapter the first crusade the sound as of the assault of an imperial city the shock of crags shot from strange engin ry the clash of wheels and clang of armed hoofs and now more loud the mingled battle cry ha hear i not allahllahllah shelley peter the hermit the preacher and main cause of the first crusade was born about the year of a noble family of picardy he was at first like all men of gentle birth of his time a soldier and fought in some at least of the wars that were going on around him for some cause no one knows why perhaps disgusted with the world perhaps struck with repentance for a criminal or dissolute life he withdrew from his fellowen and became a hermit but it would seem that his turbulent and unquiet spirit could not stand the monotony though it might support the austerities of a hermit s life and he resolved about the year to go as a pilgrim to palestine he found the pilgrims miserable indeed as most of them had been robbed or exorbitantly charged on the road there was not one in a hundred who on arriving before jerusalem found himself able to pay the fee demanded for admittance within the gates the hapless christians starving and helpless lay outside the walls dependent on the small supplies which their brethren within could send them many of them died many more turned away without having been able to enter the city famine thirst nakedness and the sword of the infidel constantly thinned their ranks which were as constantly renewed even if they got within the walls they were not much safer the monasteries could do little for them though they did what they could in the streets they were insulted mocked spat upon and sometimes beaten and in the very churches and during the celebration of services they were liable as we have seen to the attacks of a fanatic crowd who would sometimes break in upon them and outrage the most sacred ceremonies among all the indignant and pious crowd of worshippers none was more indignant or more devout than peter he paid a visit to simeon the aged patriarch and wept with him over the misfortunes of the christians when said simeon the cup of our sufferings is full god will send the christians of the west to the help of the holy city peter pressed him to write urgent letters to the sovereign powers of europe he himself promised to exhort the people to arm for the recovery of jerusalem and to testify to the statements of simeon and then to the fiery imagination of the hermit strange voices began to whisper and strange forms began to be seen arise peter cried our lord himself to him when he was worshipping at the holy sepulchre arise peter hasten to announce the tribulations of my people it is time that my servants were succoured and my sacred places delivered peter arose and departed to obey what he believed to be a divine command the pope urban who certainly saw in this an opportunity for strengthening himself against the antiope received him with ardour real or assumed and authorized him to preach the crusade over the whole of europe he crossed the alps and began first to preach in france his appearance was mean and unprepossessing his stature low he rode on a mule bareeaded and bareooted dressed in a gown of the coarsest stuff and with a long rope for a girdle the fame of his austerity the purity of his life the great purpose he had on hand went before him the irresistible eloquence of his words moved to their deepest depths the hearts of the people he preached in country and in town on the public roads and in the pulpits of churches he reminded his hearers of the profanation of the holy places he spoke of the pilgrims and narrated his own sufferings he read the letters of the venerable simeon and finally he told them how from the very recesses of the holy sepulchre the voice of jesus himself had called aloud to him bidding him go forth and summon the people to the recovery of jerusalem and as he spoke the souls of those that heard were moved with tears with repentant sobs with loud cries of anger and sorrow they vowed to lead better lives and dedicated themselves for the future to the service of god women who had sinned men who had led women astray robbers who lived by plunder murderers rich with the rewards of crime priests burdened with the heavy guilt of long years of hypocrisy all came alike to confess their sins to vow amendment to promise penance by taking the cross peter was reverenced as a saint such homage as never man had before was his they tried to get the smallest rag of his garment they crowded to look upon him or if it might be to touch him never in the history of the world has eloquent man had such an audience or has oratory produced such an effect and in the midst of this agitation confined as yet be it observed to france whose soil has ever been favourable to the birth of new ideas came letters from the emperor alexis comnenus urging on the princes of the west the duty of coming to his help the leader of the infidels was at his very gates were constantinople to fall christendom itself might fall he might survive the loss of his empire he could never survive the shame of seeing it pass under the laws of mohammed and if more were wanted to urge on the enthusiasm of the people constantinople was rich beyond all other cities of the world her riches should be freely lavished upon her defenders her daughters were fairer than the daughters of the west their love should be the reward of those who fought against the infidels the pope received the letters and held a council first at plaisance then at clermont his speech at the latter council has been variously given four or five reports of it remain all evidently written long after the real speech had been delivered all meant to contain what the pope ought to have said and all as appears to us singularly cold and artificial the council began by renewing the peace of god by placing under the protection of the church all widows orphans merchants and labourers by proclaiming the inviolability of the sanctuary and by decreeing that crosses erected by the wayside should be a refuge against violence and at its tenth sitting the council passed to what was its real business the consideration of peter s exhortations and the reading of the letters of the patriarch simeon and the emperor alexis peter spoke first narrating as usual the sufferings of the pilgrims urban followed him and when he had finished with one accord the voices of the assembled council shouted dieu le veut dieu le veut yes answered the pontiff god wills it indeed behold how our lord fulfils his own words that where two or three are gathered together in his name he will be in the midst he it is who has inspired these words let them be for you your only warry adh mar bishop of puy begged to be the first to take the vow of the crusade other bishops followed raymond count of toulouse first of the laity swore to conduct his men to palestine and then the knights and barons followed in rapid succession urban declined himself to lead the host but appointed bishop adh mar as his deputy meantime he promised all crusaders a full and complete remission of their sins he promised their goods and their families the protection of saint peter and the church he placed under anathema all who should do violence to the soldiers of the cross and he threatened with excommunication all who should fail to perform their oaths as if the madness of enthusiasm was not sufficiently kindled already the pope himself went to rouen to angers to tours and to nismes called councils harangued the people and enjoined on the bishops the duty of proclaiming the crusade and the next year was spent in preaching exhorting in maintaining the enthusiasm already kindled and in preparing for the war the kings of europe for their part had good reasons for holding aloof and so took no part in the crusade the king of france because he was under excommunication the emperor of germany because he was also under excommunication william rufus because he was an unbeliever and a scoffer but for the rank and file the first crusade which was instigated by a frenchman was mainly recruited from france here indeed the delirium of enthusiasm grew daily in intensity during the winter of nothing but the sound of preparation was heard throughout the length and breadth of the land it was not enough that knights and mentrms should take upon them the vows of the cross it behoved every man who could carry a pike or wield a sword to join the army of deliverance artisans left their work merchants their shops labourers their tools and the very robbers and brigands came out from their hidinglaces with the intention of atoning for their past sins by fighting in the army of the lord all industry save that of the forging of weapons ceased for six whole months there was no crime for six months an uninterrupted peace of god concluded by tacit consent while the crois s crowded the churches to implore the divine protection and blessing to consecrate their arms and to renew their vows in order to procure horses armour and arms the price of which went up enormously the knights sold their lands at prices far below their real value the lands were in many cases bought up by fareeing abbots and attached to monasteries so that the church at least might be enriched whatever happened no sacrifice however appeared too great in the enthusiasm of departure no loss too heavy to weigh for one moment against the obligation of the sacred oath and strange signs and wonders began to appear in the heavens stars were seen to fall upon the earth these were the kings and chiefs of the saracens unearthly flames were visible at night these betokened the conflagration of the mohammedan strong places blooded clouds stained with the blood of the infidel hovered over the east a swordhaped comet denoting the sword of the lord was in the south and in the sky were seen not once but many times the towers of a mighty city and the legions of a mighty host with the first warm days of early spring the impatience of the people was no longer to be restrained refusing to wait while the chiefs of the crusade organised their forces laid down the line of their march and matured their plans they flocked in thousands to the banks of the meuse and the moselle clamouring for immediate departure most of them were on foot but those who by any means could raise the price of a horse came mounted some travelled in carts drawn by oxen their arms were such as they could afford to buy every one however brandished a weapon of some kind it was either a spear or an axe or sword or even a heavy hammer wives daughters children old men dragged themselves along with the exultant host nothing doubting that they too would be permitted to share the triumph to witness the victory from the far corners of france from brittany from the islands from the pyrenees came troops of men whose language could not be understood and who had but one sign that of the cross to signify their brotherhood whole villages came en masse accompanied by their priests bringing with them their children their cattle their stores of provision their household utensils their all while the poorest came with nothing at all trusting that miracles similar to those which protected the israelites in the desert would protect them also that manna would drop from heaven and the rocks would open to supply them with water and such was their ignorance that as the walls of town after town became visible on their march they pressed forward eagerly demanding if that was jerusalem who should be the leader of the horde of peasants robbers and workmen who came together in the spring of on the banks of the meuse among all this vast host there were found but nine knights gaultier sans avoir walter the penniless and eight others but there was with them better than an army of knights the great preacher of the crusade the holy hermit and worker of miracles peter to him was due the glory of the movement to him should be given the honour of leading the first and it was believed the successful army by common acclamation they elected peter their leader he no less credulous than his followers accepted the charge confident of victory and mounted on his mule the mule which had borne him from town to town to preach the war clothed in his monastic garb with sandals on his feet and a cross in his hand he led the way under his command were a hundred thousand men bearing arms such as they were and an innumerable throng of women old men and children he divided this enormous host into two parts keeping the larger under his own orders and sending on the smaller as an advanceuard under the knight walter walter started first marching down the banks of the rhine he experienced no difficulties with the germans these slow to follow the example of the fiery french and moreover not yet stimulated by the preaching of a peter still sympathised with the object of the army which they doubtless thought was but a larger and a fiercer band of pilgrims like many that had gone before and assisted those who were too poor to buy provisions to the best of their power passing therefore safely through germany the disorderly host among whom all sorts of iniquities were already rife entered hungary the hungarians by this time christianised had yet no kind of enthusiasm for the objects of the crusaders or desire to aid them but their king coloman gave them guides through his vast marshes and across his rivers and permitted them to purchase what they wanted at the public marketlaces and by great fortune no accident happened to them save the beating of a few laggards after the crossing of the river maros judging it idle to avenge an insult which it cost little to endure walter pushed on till he reached belgrade the frontier town of the bulgarians these were even a ruder people than the hungarian christians they refused to recognise the crusaders as their brethren subjects of the greek crown they refused any submission but that which was extorted by arms and living in the midst of inaccessible forests they preserved a wild and savage independence which made them the terror of the pilgrims whom they maltreated and the greeks who tried to reduce them to submission here the first troubles began the governor of belgrade refusing them permission to buy provisions the army found themselves reduced to the greatest straits for want of food and seeing no other way for help they left the camp and dispersed about the country driving in the cattle and laying hands on everything they could find the bulgarians armed in haste and slaughtered vast numbers of the marauders burning alive a hundred and forty who had taken refuge in a chapel walter broke up his camp in haste and pressing on left those to their own fate who refused to obey his order to follow what that fate was may easily be surmised with diminished forces starving and dejected he pushed on through the forests till he found himself before nissa when the governor taking pity on the destitute condition of the pilgrims gave them food clothes and arms these misfortunes fell upon them it will be observed in christian lands and long before they saw the saracens thence the humbled crusaders seeing in these disasters a just punishment for their sins they were at least always ready to repent proceeded with no other enemy than famine through philippopolis and adrianople to constantinople itself here the emperor alexis comnenus gave them permission to encamp outside the town to buy and sell and to wait for the arrival of peter and the second army but if the first expedition was disastrous the second was far worse peter seems to have followed at first a somewhat different route to that of his advanced guard he went through lorraine franconia bavaria and austria and entered hungary some months after walter with an army of forty thousand men permission was readily granted to march through the country on the condition of the maintenance of order and the purchase of provisions nor was it till they arrived at semlin the place where their comrades had been beaten that any disturbance arose here they unfortunately saw suspended the arms and armour which had been stripped from the stragglers of walter s army the soldiers incensed beyond control rushed upon the little town and with the loss of a hundred men massacred every hungarian in the place then they sat down to enjoy themselves for five days the people of belgrade panictricken on hearing of the fate of semlin fled all with one accord headed by their governor and hurriedly carrying away everything portable and peter before the king of hungary had time to collect an army to avenge the taking of his city managed to transport everything to the other side of the danube and pitched his camp under the deserted walls of belgrade there the army laden with spoils of all kinds waited to collect their treasures which they carried with them on their march to nissa they stopped here one night obtaining as walter had done permission to buy and sell and giving hostages for good conduct all went well the camp was raised the hostages returned and the army on its march again when an unhappy quarrel arose between some of the stragglers consisting of about a hundred germans and the townspeople the germans set fire to seven mills and certain buildings outside the town having done this mischief they rejoined their comrades but the indignant bulgarians furious at this return for their hospitality rushed after them arms in hand they attacked the rearuard killed those who resisted and returned to the town driving before them the women and children and loaded with the spoil which remained from the sacking of semlin peter and the main body hastened back on receiving news of the disaster and tried once more to accommodate matters but in the midst of his interview with the governor and when all seemed to promise well a fresh outbreak took place and a second battle began far worse than the first the crusaders were wholly routed and fled in all directions while the carnage was indiscriminate and fearful in the evening the unhappy peter found himself on an adjoining height with five hundred men the scattered fugitives gradually rallied but oneourth of his fighting men were killed on this disastrous day and the army lost all their baggage their treasures and their stores while of the women and children by far the greater number were either killed or taken captive starving and destitute they straggled on through the forests dreading the further vengeance of the bulgarians until they entered thrace here deputies from the emperor met them with reproaches for their disorderly conduct and promises that should they conduct themselves with order his clemency would not be wanting arrived at constantinople and having rejoined walter peter lost no time in obtaining an audience from the emperor alexis heard him patiently and was even moved by his eloquence but he advised him above all things to wait for the arrival of the princes who were to follow advice was the last thing these wild hordes would listen to and eager to be in the country of the infidels to get for themselves the glory of the conquest they crossed the dardanelles and pitched their camp at a place called gemlik or ghio the first effervescence of zeal in europe had not yet however worked off its violence a monk named gotschalk emulating the honours of peter had raised by dint of preaching an army of twenty thousand germans sworn to the capture of the holy land setting out as leader of this band he followed the same road as his predecessors and met with the same disasters it was in early autumn that they passed through hungary the harvest was beginning and the germans pillaged and murdered wherever they went king coloman attacked them but with little success he then tried deceit and persuading the germans to lay down their arms and to join the hungarians as brothers he fell on them and massacred every one of all this vast host only one or two escaped through the forests to their own country to tell the tale one more turbulent band followed to meet the same fate but this was the worst the most undisciplined of all headed by a priest named volkmar and a count emicon they straggled without order or discipline filled with the wildest superstitions before their army was led sometimes a sheoat sometimes a goose which they imagined to be filled with the holy spirit and as all sins were to be expiated by the recovery of the holy land there was a growing feeling that there was no longer any need of avoiding sin consequently the wildest licence was indulged in and this which called itself the army of the lord was a horde of the most abandoned criminals their greatest crime was the slaughter of the jews along the banks of the rhine and moselle why they asked should we who march against the infidels leave behind us the enemies of our lord the bishops of the sees through which they passed vainly interposed their entreaties in cologne and mayence every jew was murdered some of the miserable people tied stones round their own necks and leaped into the river some killed their wives and children and set fire to their houses perishing in the flames the mothers killed the infants at their breasts and the christians themselves fled in all directions at the approach of an army as terrible to its friends as to its foes but their course was of short duration at the town of altenburg on the confines of hungary which they attempted to storm they were seized with a sudden panic and fled in all directions being slaughtered like sheep emicon got together a small band whom he led home again a few others were led by their chiefs southwards and joined the princes of the crusade in italy none of them according to william of tyre found their way to peter the hermit once across the dardanelles peter s troops who amounted it is said in spite of all their losses to no fewer than a hundred thousand fighting men fixed a camp on the shores of the gulf of nicomedia and began to ravage the country in all directions the division of the booty soon caused quarrels and a number of italians and germans deserting the camp went up the country in a body and took possession of a small fortress in the neighbourhood of nic a whose garrison they massacred then they were in their turn besieged and with the exception of their leader renaud or rinaldo who embraced the mahometan faith were slaughtered to a man the news of this disaster roused the christians not to a sense of their danger which they could not yet comprehen but to a vehement desire for revenge they made the luckless walter lead them against nic a and issued forth from their camp en masse a disordered shouting multitude crying for vengeance against the turks but their end was at hand the sultan of nic a placed half his army in ambuscade in the forest keeping the other half in the plain the christians were attacked in the front and in the rear and cooped up together in confusion badly armed offered very slight resistance walter himself fell one of the first the carnage was terrific and of all the hundred thousand whom peter and walter had brought across the dardanelles but three thousand escaped these fled to a fortress by the seahore the bones of their comrades whitened by the eastern sun long stood as a monument of the disaster pointing skeleton fingers on the road to jerusalem the road of death and defeat only three thousand out of all these hordes certainly a quarter of a million in number which flocked after peter on his mule we can hardly believe that all were killed some of the women and children at least might be spared and without doubt their blood yet flows in the veins of many hungarian and bulgarian families but this was only the first instalment of slaughter there remained the mighty armies which were even then upon the road as for peter whose courage was as easily daunted as his enthusiasm was easily roused he fled in dismay and misery back to constantinople having lost all authority even over the few men who remained with him he inveighed against their disorders and their crimes and he declared that these were the causes of their defeat he might have added that his own weakness the vanity which led him to accept the r le offered him by an ignorant crowd of general as well as preacher was no less a cause of disaster than the disorder which it was his business to check and combat day by day his disappointment was such as would be enough to kill a really proud and strong man but peter was not a strong man in the hour of danger he bent like the reed to the storm the violence of the tempest once past however like the reed he lifted up his head again he could preach endurance but he could not himself endure his faith required constant stimulants his courage the fresh fire of continual success peter lifted up his head again when he saw the splendid array of godfrey and raymond but his old authority with the chiefs was gone like a wornut tool he had served his purpose and was cast aside he had no more voice in their councils no more power over their enthusiasm he lapsed into utter insignificance save once when we find him actually trying to desert the army at antioch and endeavouring to run away and once later on when he received the brief ovation from the native christians in the hour of final triumph at jerusalem he returned it may be added in safety to france when the war was over and spent sixteen years more in honourable obscurity the head of a monastery never in the world s history with the exception of mohammed alone has one man produced an effect so great and so immediate and seldom has one man wielded an instrument so potent as peter when he set forth at the head of an army which wanted only discipline to make it invincible but now vexilla regis prodeunt armies of a different character are assembling in the west foremost among them is that headed by godfrey de bouillon duke of lorraine of him and of his brother baldwin who accompanied him we shall have to speak again a word on the other chiefs of the first crusade with the army of godfrey were joined the troops of robert duke of normandy and count robert of flanders robert who had pledged his duchy for five years to his brother for ten thousands marks we all know he was strong brave and generous but he had no other good quality had his prudence his wisdom in council been equal to his courage or had his character for temperance and selfestraint been better he would probably have obtained the crown of jerusalem before godfrey as it was he went out for the purpose of fighting he fought well and came home again no richer than when he went he was joined in syria by the saxon prince edgar atheling the lawful heir to the english crown but the chroniclers are silent as to the prowess of the english contingent the other leaders who followed separately were hugh vermandois hugh le grand the brother to the king of france and stephen count of blois a scholar and a poet he it was who married adela daughter of william the conqueror and was the father of our king stephen both of these chiefs left the crusade at antioch and went home disgusted at their sufferings and illuccess but after the taking of the city popular opinion forced them to go out again count raymond of toulouse who led his own army by an independent route is perhaps the most difficult character to understand he was not pious he was cold and calculating he was old and rich he had already gained distinction by fighting against the moors he loved money why did he go it is impossible to say except that he had vague ambitions of kingdoms in the east more splendid than any in the west he alienated a great part of his territory to get treasure for the war and he was by far the richest of the princes the men he led the proven aux were much less ignorant less superstitious and less smitten with the divine fury of the rest provence which in two more centuries was to be itself the scene of a crusade as bloody as any in palestine was already touched with the heresy which was destined to break out in full violence before very many years the proven aux loved music dancing good cheer but they were indifferent to the church they could plunder better than they could pray and they were more often gathered round the provisions than the pulpits it is singular therefore that the most signal miracle which attended the progress of the christian arms should have been wrought among the proven aux it was so however peter bartholomeus who found the holy lance was a priest of provence adh mar bishop of puy himself a proven al the most cleareaded most prudent and most thoughtful of the army treated the story of peter it is true with disdain nor did raymond believe it as was evident when on there appearing shortly afterwards symptoms that another miracle of which he saw no use was about to happen he suppressed it with a strong hand at the same time he did not disdain to make use of the holy lance and the miracle most certainly contributed very largely as we shall see to the success of the christians the two remaining great chiefs were bohemond and tancred bohemond who was a whole cubit taller than the tallest man in the army was the son of that norman robert guiscard who with a band of some thirty knights managed to wrest the whole of calabria apulia and sicily from the greeks on his father s death he had quarrelled with his brother roger over the inheritance and was actually besieging him in the town of amalfi when the news of the crusades reached him the number of those engaged the rank of the leaders the large share taken by the normans inspired him with the hope that here at last was the chance of humiliating and even conquering his enemy the emperor of constantinople perhaps too some noble impulse actuated him however that may be he began himself to preach a crusade to his own army and with so much success for he preached of glory and plunder as well as of religion that he found himself in a few days at the head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot with these he joined the other chiefs at constantinople his life was a long series of battles he was crafty and sagacious hence his name of guiscard the wise one quite indifferent to the main object of the crusaders in fact he did not go on with them to jerusalem itself and anxious only to do the greeks a mischief and himself some good with him went his cousin tancred the hero of the jerusalem delivered the history of the first crusade contains all his history after the conquest of jerusalem and after displaying extraordinary activity and bravery he was made prince of galilee and his cousin was prince of antioch tancred is a hero of romance apart from his fighting he has no character in every battle he is foremost but when the battle is over we hear nothing about him he appears however to have had a great deal of his cousin s prudence and united with the bravery of the lion some at least of the cunning of the fox he died about the year hugh count of vermandois who was one of the chiefs of the army brought by robert of normandy was the third son of henry i of france he was called le grand not on account of any mental or physical superiority but because by marriage he was the head of the vermandois house he was one of the first to desert the crusade terrified by the misfortunes which overtook the expedition but like stephen of blois he was obliged by the force of popular opinion to go back again as a crusader the second time he was wounded by the turks near nic a and only got as far as tarsus in cilicia where he died like robert of normandy he joined to great bravery and an extreme generosity a certain weakness of character which marred all his finer qualities robert of flanders seems to have been a fighting man pure and simple by the saracens called st george and by his own side the sword and lance of the christians he no more fighting remaining to be done returned quietly to his own states with the comfortable conviction that he had atoned for his former sins by his conduct in the holy war he enjoyed ten years more fighting at home and then got drowned in the river marne an honest singleinded knight who found himself in perfect accord with the spirit of his age with these principal barons and chiefs were a crowd of poorer princes each with his train of knights and mentrms the money for the necessary equipments had been raised in various ways some had sold their lands others their seigneurial rights some had pawned their states while one or two despising these direct and obvious means of raising funds had found a royal road to money by pillaging the villages and towns around them it was not till eight months after the council of clermont that godfrey s army consisting of ten thousand knights and eighty thousand foot was able to begin its march fortunately a good harvest had just been gathered in and food of all kinds was abundant and cheap the army moreover was wellisciplined and no excesses were committed on its way through germany it followed pretty nearly the same line as that taken by walter and peter and must have been troubled along the whole route by news of the extravagances and disasters of those who had preceded them arriving on the frontiers of hungary godfrey sent deputies to king coloman asking permission to march peaceably buying whatever he had need of through his dominions hostages consisting of his brother baldwin and his family were given for the good behaviour of the troops and permission was granted the king of hungary following close on the track of the army in case any breach of faith should be attempted but none took place and at semlin when the last crusader had crossed the river into bulgarian territory king coloman personally and with many expressions of friendship and goodwill delivered over the hostages and parted getting through the land of the bulgarians as quickly as might be godfrey pushed on as far as philippopolis there he learned that count hugh who had been shipwrecked sailing in advance of his army on the shores of epirus was held a prisoner by alexis comnenus very probably as a sort of hostage for the good behaviour of the very host whose help he had implored godfrey sent imperatively to demand the release of the count and being put off with an evasive reply gave his troops liberty to ravage and plunder along the road a privilege which they fully appreciated this practical kind of reply convinced alexis that the barbarians were not at least awed by the greatness of his fame he hastened to give way and assured godfrey that his prisoner should be released directly the army arrived at constantinople footnote august meantime the other armies were all on their way converging to constantinople the route followed by them is not at all times clear some appear to have marched through italy dalmatia and across thessaly while a few went by sea and though the first armies of peter and walter carried off a vast number of pilgrims there can be no doubt that these armies were followed by a great number of priests monks women and persons unable to fight alexis on hearing of bohemond s speedy arrival was greatly alarmed as indeed he had reason to be with his usual duplicity he sent ambassadors to flatter his formidable visitor while he ordered his frontier troops to harass him on his march and bohemond had alternately to receive the assurances of the emperor s friendship and to fight his troops no wonder that he wrote to godfrey at constantinople to be on his guard as he had to do with the most ferocious wild beast and the most wicked man alive but in spite of his hatred the fierce norman found himself constrained to put off his resentment in the presence of greek politeness and the rich gifts with which alexis loaded him if they did not quiet his suspicions at least allayed his wrath alexis got rid of his unwelcome visitors as speedily as he could after going through the ceremony of adopting godfrey as his son and putting the empire under his protection he received the homage of the princes one after the other with the exception alone of tancred and then he sent them all across the straits to meet whatever fortune awaited them on the other side the story of the first crusade is an oftold tale but it is a tale which bears telling often there is nothing in history which may be compared with this extraordinary rising of whole peoples the numbers which came from western europe cannot of course be even approximately stated probably counting the women children and campollowers their number would not be less than a million of these far more than a half probably twohirds came from the provinces of france the germans were but slightly affected by the universal enthusiasm the english not at all edgar atheling brought a band of his countrymen to join robert of normandy but these were probably those who had compromised themselves in former attempts to raise northumbria and other parts of england the italians came from the south but not from the north and nearly the whole of spain was occupied by the caliphate of cordova that all these soldiers were fired with the same ardour were led by the same disinterested hope is not to be supposed but it is certain from every account whether christian or arabic that the main object of their enterprise was a motive power strong enough of itself to enable them to endure hardships and privations almost incredible and to combat with forces numerically at least ten times their superior the way to the holy land lay through a hostile country asia minor overrun by the mohammedans since twenty years was garrisoned rather than settled numerous as were the followers of the crescent they had not been able to do more in their rapid march of conquest than to take strongholds and towns and keep them there were even some towns which had never surrendered while of those which belonged to them many were held by insufficient forces and contained an element of weakness in the large number of christian inhabitants and the first of these towns which came in their way was the town of nic a the miserable remnant of peter s army on the arrival of their friends made haste to show them the places of their own disasters these fugitives had lived hidden in the forest and now on seeing the brassard of the cross emerged barefooted ragged unarmed cowed to tell the story of their sufferings they took the soldiers to see the plain where their great army had been massacred there were the piles of bones the plain white with them they took them to the camp where the women and children had been left these were gone but the remains were left of the old men and those who had tried to defend them their bodies lay in the moat which had been cut round the camp in the centre like a pillar of reproach stood the white stones which had served for the altar of the camp filled with wrath at the sight of these melancholy objects the soldiers cried out to be led against their enemy and the whole army preceded by four thousand pioneers to clear the way was marched in good order towards nic a where the enemy awaited them the crusaders they spoke nineteen different languages were accoutred with some attempt at similarity the barons and knights wore a coat of chainrmour while a helmet set with silver for the princes of steel for knights and of iron for the rest protected their heads round bucklers were carried by the knights long shields by the footoldiers besides the lance the sword the arrow they carried the mace and battleaxe the sling and the terrible crossbow while for a rallyingoint for the soldiers every prince bore painted on his standard those birds animals and towns which subsequently became coatsfrms and gave birth to the science of heraldry the total number of the gigantic host amounted it is said to one hundred thousand knights and five hundred thousand footoldiers but this is evidently an exaggeration if it is not the losses by battle famine and disease were proportionately greater than those of any wars recorded in history the first operation was the siege of nic a nic a the city of the great council and the avenging of the slaughtered army of peter nic a stood on the low shores of a lake it was provided with vessels of all kinds by which it could receive men and provisions and was therefore practically impregnable but the mohammedans fully advertised of the approach of their enemies had made preparations to receive them and with an immense army all mounted charged the array of the christians on the moment of their arrival in the plains and while they were occupied in putting up their tents victory such as it was remained with the crusaders but cost them the lives of more than two thousand of their men the siege of nic a undertaken after this battle made slow progress while the christians wasted their strength in vain efforts to demolish the walls and cross the moats the garrison constantly reinforced during the night by means of the lake held out unshaken for some weeks finding out the means by which their strength was recruited godfrey by immense exertions transported overland from the neighbouring sea a number of light craft which he launched on the lake and succeeded in accomplishing a perfect blockade of the town the nic ans terrified at the success of this man uvre and by the fate of their most important town were ready to surrender at discretion when the cunning of alexis comnenus who had despatched a small force nominally for the assistance of the crusaders but really for the purpose of watching after his own interests succeeded in inducing the town to surrender to him alone and the christians after all their labour had the mortification of seeing the greek flag flying over the citadel instead of their own from his own point of view the emperor was evidently right the crusaders had sworn to protect his empire he claimed sovereignty over all these lands his object was neither to revenge the death of a horde of invaders nor to devastate the towns nor to destroy the country but to recover and preserve nic a at least was almost within his reach and though he could not expect that his authority would be recognised in the south of asia minor or in syria he had reason to hope that here at any rate so near to constantinople and so recently after the oaths of the princes it would be recognised so certainly thought the princes for in spite of the unrepressed indignation of the army they refrained from pillaging the town and murdering the infidels and gave the word to march it was now early summer the soldiers had not yet experienced the power of an asiatic sun no provision was made against the dangers of famine and thirst and their way led through a land parched with heat devastated by wars over rocky passes across pathless plains the crusaders neither knew the country nor made any preparations beyond carrying provisions for two or three days they were moreover encumbered with their campollowers their baggage and the weight of their arms they were divided principally for convenience of forage into two corps arm e of which one was commanded by godfrey raymond robert of flanders and the count of vermandois while the other was led by the three norman chiefs robert tancred and bohemond for seven days all went well the armies having completely lost sight of each other but confident after their recent successes that there would be no more enemies at hand to combat they were mistaken tancred s division on the evening of the th of june pitched their camp in a valley called by william of tyre the valley of gorgona it was protected on one side by a river on the other by a marsh filled with reeds the night was passed in perfect security but at daybreak the enemy was upon them bohemond took the command placing the women and the sick in the midst he divided the cavalry into three brigades and prepared to dispute the passage of the river the saracens discharged their arrows into the thick ranks of the crusaders whose wounded horses confused and disordered them unable to endure these attacks with patience the christians crossed the river and charged their enemies but the saracens mounted on lighter horses made way for them to pass and renewed the discharge of their arrows another band taking advantage of the knights having crossed the river forded it at a higher point and attacked the camp itself then the slaughter of the sick and wounded and even of the women save those whose beauty was sufficient to ransom their lives began on the other side of the stream the knights fought every one for himself tancred nearly killed in the e was saved by bohemond robert of normandy performed prodigies the camp was retaken and the women rescued but the day was not won nor would it have been won but for the arrival of godfrey to whom bohemond early in the day had sent a messenger he brought up the whole of his army and the saracens retreating to the hills found themselves attacked on all sides they fled in utter disorder leaving twentyhree thousand dead on the field and the whole of their camp and baggage in the hands of the christians these had lost four thousand besides the number of followers killed in the camp the booty was immense and the soldiers pleased themselves by dressing in the long silk robes of the mussulmans while they refurnished themselves with arms from those they found upon the dead conscious however of the danger they had escaped they were careful to acknowledge that they would not have carried the day had it not been for st george and st demetrius who had been plainly visible to many fighting on their side and the respect which they conceived for the saracens prowess taught them at least a salutary lesson of caution while they were rejoicing the enemy was acting the defeated turks retreating southwards by the way which the christians must follow devastated and destroyed every thing as they traversed the country procuring one auxiliary at least in the shape of famine they had two more thirst and heat the crusaders once more on the march resolved not to separate again and formed henceforth but one army but they journeyed through a desert and desolate country there was no food but the roots of plants their horses died for want of water and forage the knights had to walk on foot or to ride oxen and asses every beast was converted into a beast of burden until the time came when the beasts themselves perished by the way and all the baggage was abandoned their path led through phrygia a wild and sterile country with no fountains or rivers the road was strewn as they went along by the bodies of those who died of sunstroke or of thirst women overcome by fatigue and want of water lay down and were delivered of children and there died mothers and infants in one terrible day five hundred died on the march the falcons and hawks which the knights had been unable to leave behind fell dead from their perches the hounds deserted their masters and went away to seek for water the horses themselves in which the hope of the soldier was placed lay down and died at last they came to a river even this timely relief was fatal for three hundred killed themselves by drinking too much they rested after this disastrous march at antiocheia the former capital of pisidia here raymond fell ill but happily recovered and godfrey was dangerously wounded in a conflict with a bear to account for the discomfiture of the prince it is recorded that the bear was the biggest and most ferocious bear ever seen during their stay at antiocheia tancred and baldwin the former with a detachment of italians the latter with one of flemings were sent to explore the country to bring help to the christians and report on the means of obtaining provisions they went first to iconium finding no enemies they went southwards and tancred leading the way made an easy conquest of tarsus promising to spare the lives of the garrison baldwin arrived the next day and on perceiving the flag of tancred on the towers insisted on the ground that his own force was superior in numbers on taking it down and replacing it by his own a violent quarrel arose the first of the many which were to disgrace the history of the crusades neither would give way they agreed at last to refer the dispute to the inhabitants these at first gave the preference to tancred but at last yielding to the threats of baldwin transferred their allegiance to him and threw tancred s flag over the ramparts tancred withdrew indignant and marched with all his men to adana an important place some twenty miles from tarsus this he found in the possession of a burgundian adventurer who had got a company of pilgrims to follow him and seized the place history does not deign unfortunately to notice the exploits of the viri obscuri but it is clear enough that while the great princes were seizing states and cities bands of armed soldiers separated from the great army were overrunning the country taking possession of small forts and towns where they lived at their own will and pleasure till the turks came and killed them all the burgundian was courteous to tancred and helped him with provisions on his way to malmistra a large and important place before which he pitched his camp but a terrible calamity had happened at tarsus baldwin got into the town and jealous of his newlycquired possession ordered the gates to be carefully closed and guarded in the evening a troop of three hundred crusaders sent by bohemond to reinforce tancred arrived at the town and asked for admission baldwin refused they pleaded the extremity of fatigue and hunger to which a long march had reduced them baldwin still refused his own men urged him to admit them baldwin refused again in the morning they were all found dead killed in the night by the turks who took advantage of their sleep and exhaustion at this spectacle the grief and rage of the soldiers were turned against the cause of their comrades death baldwin took refuge in a tower but presently came out and lamenting the disaster of which he alone was the cause pointed his soldiers to the towers where the garrison of the turks prisoners but under promise of safet were shut up the christians massacred every one here they were joined by a fleet of pirates who after having been for ten years the terror of the mediterranean were desirous of expiating their crimes by taking part in the crusade their leader guymer was a boulogne man and readily brought his men as a reinforcement to the troops of baldwin his seigneur baldwin left a garrison in tarsus and set out to rejoin tancred but the death of the three hundred could not so easily be forgotten tancred and his army maddened at the intelligence of baldwin s approach clamoured for revenge and tancred without much reluctance gave the order to attack baldwin s camp a sanguinary battle followed in which tancred s forces inferior in numbers were worsted and obliged to withdraw the night brought reflection and the next morning was occupied in reconciliation and promises of friendship malmistra was taken and all the mohammedans slaughtered and after a few more exploits tancred returned to the army baldwin however whose ardour for the recovery of jerusalem had yielded by this time to his ambition only saw in the disordered state of the country the splendid opportunities which it presented to one who had the courage to seize them perhaps the sight of the successful burgundian of adana helped him to form projects of his own perhaps the remarks of an armenian named pancrates who was always whispering in his ear of the triumphs to be won by an independent line of action he returned to godfrey indeed but only to try his powers of seduction among the soldiers whom he incited to follow him by magnificent promises the princes were alarmed at the first news of his intended defection at a council hastily assembled it was resolved to prohibit any crusader whatever his rank from leaving the army baldwin however the very night on which this resolution was carried secretly marched out of the camp at the head of some twelve hundred footoldiers and two hundred knights accompanied by his armenian friend his exploits until he was summoned back to jerusalem hardly concern us here after taking one or two small towns and quarrelling with pancrates whom he left behind he pushed on to edessa which by a series of lucky escapes he entered with only a hundred knights to become its king here he must for the present be left meantime the great army of the crusaders was pressing on for the moment it was unmolested both christian and saracen had begun to conceive a respect for each other s prowess the latter found that his innumerable troops of light cavalry were of little use against the heavilyrmed and disciplined masses of the crusaders while these harassed by the perpetual renewal of armies which seemed only destroyed to spring again from the earth and convinced now that the recovery of the holy city would be no holiday ramble in a sunny land marched with better discipline and more circumspection but the saracens unable to raise another army in time fled before them leaving towns and villages unoccupied the christians burnt the mosques and plundered the country even the passes of mount taurus were left unguarded and the christian army passed through defiles and valleys where a very small force might have barred the passage for the whole army they suffered however from their constant enemies heat and thirst on one mountain called the mountain of the devil the army had to pass along a path so narrow that the horses were led and the men could not walk two abreast here wearied with the ascent faint with thirst hundreds sank unable to proceed or fell over the precipices it was the last of the cruel trials through which they were to pass before they reached the land of their pilgrimage from the summit of the last pass they beheld stretched out at their feet the fair land of syria covered with ruins as it was those ruins which exist to the present day and devastated by so many successive wars nothing had been able to ruin the fertility of the soil and after the arid plains through which they had passed no wonder the worn and weary soldiers rejoiced and thanked god aloud when they saw at last the very country to which they were journeying the ordeal of thirst and heat had been passed through and their numbers were yet strong nothing now remained as they fondly thought but to press on and fight the enemy before the very walls of jerusalem the successes of tancred cleared the way for the advance of the main army nothing interposed to stop them provisions were plentiful and their march was unimpeded by any enemy count robert of flanders led the advance corps at artasia a town about a day s march from antioch the gates were thrown open to them and though the garrison of antioch threw out flying squadrons of cavalry they were not able to check the advance of the army which swarmed along the roads in numbers reduced indeed by one half from the six hundred thousand who gathered before nic a but still irresistible the old bridge of stone which crossed the orontes was stormed and the crusaders were fairly in syria and before antioch the present governor of this great and important town was baghi seyan one of the seljukian princes he had with him a force of about twentyive thousand foot and horse he was defended by a double wall of stone strengthened by towers he was plentifully supplied with provisions he had sent messengers for assistance to all quarters and might reasonably hope to be relieved and he had expelled from the town all useless mouths including the native christians moreover it was next to impossible for the crusaders to establish a complete line round the city and cut him off from supplies and reinforcements it was late in the autumn when the christian army sat down before the first place for the first two or three weeks the country was scoured for provisions and the soldiers improvident and reckless lived in a luxury and abundance which they had never before experienced but even syria fertile and rich could not long suffice for the daily wants of a wasteful army of three hundred thousand men food began to grow scarce foraging parties brought in little or nothing though they scoured the whole country bands of turks mounted on fleet and hardy horses intercepted straggling parties and robbed them of their cattle the fleet brought them very small supplies baldwin had as yet sent nothing from edessa and famine once more made its appearance in the camp the rains of winter fell and their tents were destroyed the poor lived on what they could find bark and roots the rich had to spend all their money in buying food and all the horses died worse still there was defection among the very leaders robert of normandy went to laodicea and was persuaded with great difficulty to come back peter the hermit fairly ran away and was brought back a prisoner to the army which his own voice had raised and when bohemond and tancred went out with as large a force as could be spared to procure provisions they were attacked by superior numbers and obliged to return emptyanded bishop adh mar seeing in the sins of the camp a just cause for the punishments that were falling upon it enjoined a three days fast and public prayers the former was superfluous inasmuch as the whole camp was fasting but he did more he caused all women to be sent away and all games of chance to be entirely prohibited the distress continued but hope and confidence were revived and when early in the year supplies were brought in the army regained most of its old bravoure a victory gained over a reinforcement of twentyive thousand turks aided in reviving the spirit of the soldiers it was in this action that godfrey is reported to have cut a turk completely through the body so that his horse galloped off with the legs and lower part of the trunk still in the saddle the camp of the enemy was taken and for a time there was once more abundance but the siege was not yet over for eight months it lingered on defended with the obstinacy that the turks always displayed when brought to bay within stone walls it was not till june that the town not the citadel was taken by the treachery of one pyrrhus an armenian renegade he offered secretly to put the town which was in his charge into the hands of bohemond the norman chief always anxious to promote his own interests proposed at the council of the crusaders to take the town on condition that it should be given to him raymond of toulouse alone objected his objection was overruled and on the night of the nd of june pyrrhus admitted the christians they made themselves masters under cover of the darkness of ten of the towers round the walls and opening the gates to their own men made an easy conquest of the town in the morning slaughtering every mussulman they could find baghi seyan fled and being abandoned by his guards was murdered by some syrian woodcutters who brought his head to the camp and then once more untaught by their previous sufferings the crusaders for a few days gave themselves up to the enjoyment of their booty but the citadel was not taken and the host of kerboga was within a short march of the town he came with the largest army that the christians had yet encountered robert of flanders defended the bridge for a whole day with five hundred men but was obliged to retire and the christians were in their turn the besieged and then again famine set in the seashore was guarded by the turks and supplies could not be procured from the fleet the horses and all the beasts of burden were slaughtered and eaten some of the knights who were fainthearted managed to let themselves down by ropes from the walls and made their way to stephen of blois who had long since separated from the main army and was now lying at alexandretta they brought such accounts of the misery of the army that stephen abandoned the cause as hopeless and set sail with his men for cilicia here he found alexis himself with a large army consisting chiefly of those who had arrived too late to join the army of godfrey the newcomers heard with dismay the accounts given by stephen they gave themselves up to lamentation and despair they blasphemed the god who had permitted his soldiers to be destroyed and for some days would actually permit no prayers to be offered up in their camp alexis broke up his camp and returned to constantinople and when the news arrived in antioch the crusaders too wretched to fight or to hope shut themselves up in the houses and refused to come out bohemond set fire to the town and so compelled them to show themselves but could not make them fight where human eloquence failed one of those miracles common enough in the ages of credulity the result of overheated imaginations and excited brains succeeded a vision of the night came to one peter bartholom us a monk of two men in shining raiment one of them st andrew himself took the monk into the air and brought him to the church of st peter and set him at the south side of the altar he then showed him the head of a lance this he said was the lance which opened the side of our lord see where i bury it get twelve men to dig in the spot till they find it but in the morning peter was afraid to tell his vision this was before the taking of antioch but after the town was taken the vision came again and in his dream peter saw once more the apostle and received his reproaches for neglect of his commands peter remonstrated that he was poor and of no account and then he saw that the apostle s companion was none other than the blessed lord himself and the humble monk was privileged to fall and kiss his feet we are not of those who believe that men are found so base as to contrive a story of this kind there is little doubt in our minds that this poor peter starving as he was full of fervour and enthusiasm dreamed his dream not once but twice and went at last brimful of pious gratitude to adh mar with his tale adh mar heard him with incredulity and coldness but raymond saw in this incident a means which might be turned to good account he sent twelve men to the church and from morning till night they dug in vain but at length peter himself leaping into the hole they had made called aloud on god to redeem his promise and produced a rusty spearead adh mar acquiesced with the best grace in his power the lance was exhibited to the people the next morning and the enthusiasm of the army famished and ragged and dismounted once more beat as high as when they sewed the red cross badge upon their shoulders and shouted dieu le veut they had been besieged three weeks all their horses except three hundred were killed their ranks were grievously thinned but they went out to meet the enemy with such confidence that the only orders given related to the distribution of the plunder as they took their places in the plain adh mar raised their spirits by the announcement of another miracle saint george saint maurice and saint demetrius had themselves been distinctly seen to join the army and were in their midst the christians fought as only religious enthusiasts can fight as the mohammedans fought when the caliph omar led his conquering bands northwards with the delights of heaven for those who fell and the joys of earth for those who survived the turks were routed with enormous slaughter their camp rich and luxurious fell into the hands of the conquerors plenty took the place of starvation the common soldiers amused themselves with decking their persons with the silken robes they found in the huts the cattle were driven to the town in long processions and once more forgetful of all but the present the christians revelled and feasted footnote among the spoils taken by the christians one of the chroniclers reports a mass of manuscripts on which were traced the sacrilegious rites of the mahometans in execrable characters doubtless arabic probably among these manuscripts were many of the greatest importance nothing is said about their fate but of course they were all destroyed the rejoicings had hardly ceased when it was found that another enemy had to be encountered battle was to be expected famine had already twice been experienced this time it was pestilence caused no doubt by the crowding together of so large an army and the absence of sanitary measures the first to fall was the wise and good adh mar most sensible of all the chiefs his was a dire loss to the crusaders better could they have spared even the fiery tancred or the crafty bohemond the crusaders terrified and awetricken clamoured to be led to jerusalem but needs must that they remained till the heats of summer passed and health came again with the early winter breezes in their camp at antioch it was not till november that they set out on their march to jerusalem the time had been consumed in small expeditions the capture of unimportant places and the quarrels of the princes over the destination of antioch which bohemond claimed for himself their rival claims were still unsettled when the voice of the people made itself heard and very shame made them for a time at least act in concert and the advance corps led by bohemond robert of normandy and raymond of toulouse began their southward march with the siege of marra an important place which they took after three or four weeks by assault fresh disputes arose about the newlycquired town but the common soldiers furious at these nevernding delays ended them by the simple expedient of pulling down the walls it was the middle of january however before they resumed their march from marah to capharda thence along the orontes when the small towns were placed in their hands to hums when they turned westward to the sea and sat down before the castle of arca till they should be joined by the main body which was still at antioch it came up in april and the army of the crusaders united again were ready to resume their march when they were interrupted by more disputes in an illimed hour bohemond the incredulous norman accused raymond of conniving with peter to deceive the army by palming off upon them an old rusty lanceead as the sacred spear which had pierced the side of the lord arnold chaplain to duke robert of normandy was brought forward to support the charge he rested his argument chiefly on the fact that adh mar had disbelieved the miracle but he contended as well that the spearead could not possibly be in antioch he was confuted in the manner customary to the time one bold monk swore that adh mar after death for his contumacy in refusing to believe in the miracle had been punished by having one side of his beard burned in the flames of hell and was not permitted a full enjoyment of heaven till the beard should grow again another quoted a prophecy of saint peter alleged to be in a syrian gospel that the invention of the lance was to be a sign of the deliverance of the christians a third had spoken personally with saint mark himself while the virgin mary had appeared by night to a fourth to corroborate the story arnold pretended to give way before testimony so overwhelming and was ready to retract his opinion publicly when peter crazed with enthusiasm offered to submit his case to the ordeal of fire this method was too congenial to the fierce and eager spirits of the crusaders to be refused raymond agiles who was a witness thus tells the story peter s proposition appeared to us reasonable and after enjoining a fast on peter we agreed to kindle the fire on good friday itself on the day appointed the pile was prepared after noon the princes and the people assembled to the number of forty thousand the priests coming barefooted and dressed in their sacerdotal robes the pile was made with dry branches of oliverees fourteen feet long and four feet high divided into two heaps with a narrow path a foot wide between each as soon as the wood began to burn i myself raymond pronounced these words if the lord himself has spoken to this man face to face and if saint andrew has shown him the lance of the lord let him pass through the fire without receiving any hurt or if not let him be burnt with the lance which he carries in his hand and all bending the knee replied amen footnote he was chaplain to count raymond of toulouse then peter dressed in a single robe kneeling before the bishop of albaric called god to witness that he had seen jesus on the cross face to face and that he had heard from the mouth of the saviour and that of the apostles peter and andrew the words reported to the princes he added that nothing of what he had said in the name of the saints and in the name of the lord had been invented by himself and declared that if there was found any falsehood in his story he consented to suffer from the flames and for the other sins that he had committed against god and his neighbours he prayed that god would pardon him and that the bishop all the other priests and the people would implore the mercy of god for him this said the bishop gave him the lance peter knelt again and making the sign of the cross he reached the flames without appearing afraid he remained one moment in the midst of the fire and then came out by the grace of god after peter had gone through the fire and although the flames were still raging the people gathered up the brands the ashes and the charcoal with such ardour that in a few moments nothing was left the lord in the end performed great miracles by means of these sacred relics peter came out of the flames without even his gown being burned and the light veil which covered the lanceead escaped uninjured he made immediately the sign of the cross and cried with a loud voice god help to the crowd who pressed upon him to be certain that it was really he then in their eagerness and because everybody wanted to touch him and to have even some little piece of his dress they trampled him under their feet cut off pieces of his flesh broke his backone and broke his ribs he was only saved from being killed there and then by raymond pelot a knight who hastily called a number of soldiers and rescued him when he was brought into our tent we dressed his wounds and asked him why he had stopped so long in the fire because he said the lord appeared to me in the midst of the flames and taking me by the hand said since thou hast doubted of the holy lance which the blessed andrew showed to thee thou shalt not go out from this sound and safe nevertheless thou shalt not see hell after these words he sent me on see now the marks of fire on my body and in fact there were certain burnings in the legs small in number though the wounds were great peter bartholomew died the day after of the fire said bohemond the doubter who continued in his disbelief in spite of the ordeal of the injuries he had received in the crowd said raymond of toulouse but the authority of the lance was established and it was to do good service in the battles to come the faith of the crusaders was kept up by many other visions and miracles one that had the greatest effect was a vision seen by anselm to him appeared by night angelram the young son of the count of saint paul who had been killed at marra know said the phantom that those who fight for christ die not and whence this glory that surrounds you then angelram showed in the heavens a palace of crystal and diamonds it is there he said that i have borrowed my splendour there is my dwellinglace one finer still is preparing for you into which you will soon enter the next day anselm after telling of this apparition confessed and received the sacraments though full of health and going into battle was struck by a stone in the forehead and died immediately on their way to tripoli where they first saw the sugarane the impatience of the soldiers manifested itself so strongly that the chiefs could not venture to sit down before the place but pushed on after making a sort of treaty with its governor here messengers arrived from alexis entreating them to wait for him and promising to bring an army in july but the time was gone by for negotiation and delay and taking the seahore route by which they ensured the protection of the fleet they marched southwards to beirout sidon and tyre and acre were passed without much opposition and the crusaders arrived at sarea which is within sixty miles of jerusalem by marches quick rather than forced for the enthusiasm of the army was once more at its height they reached lydda where the church of saint george lay in ruins having recently been destroyed by the turks and thence to ramleh here an embassy from bethlehem waited for them with prayers to protect their town tancred with a hundred knights only rode off with them the people received them with psalms of joy and took them to see the church of the nativity but they would not stay bethlehem is but four miles from jerusalem and tancred rode on in advance eager to be the first to see the city he ascended the mount of olives unmolested and there found a hermit who pointed out to him the sacred sites the little troop rode back in triumph to tell the crusaders that the city was almost within their grasp the soldiers rough and rude as they were and stained with every vice were yet open to the influences of this the very goal of their hopes from a rising ground they beheld at last the walls of the holy city and when they heard the name of jerusalem the christians could not prevent themselves in the fervour of their devotion from shedding tears they fell on their faces to the ground glorifying and adoring god who in his goodness had heard the prayers of his people and had granted them according to their desires to arrive at this most sacred place the object of all their hopes footnote while they were considering which road was the easiest for their march to jerusalem the crusaders received a deputation from a christian people said to be sixty thousand in number living in the mountains of lebanus they offered their services as guides and pointed out that there were three roads the first by way of damascus level and plain and always abounding in provisions the second over mount lebanon safe from any enemy and also full of provisions but difficult for beasts of burden and the third by the seahore abounding in defiles where fifty mussulmans would be able if they pleased to stop the whole of mankind but said these christians if you are of a verity that nation which is to overcome jerusalem you must pass along the seahore however difficult that road may appear according to the gospel of st peter your way such as you have made it and such as you must make it is all laid down in that gospel which we possess what was this gospel or is it only one of the credulous stories of raymond agiles the army which sat down before jerusalem numbered about twenty thousand fighting men and an equal number of camp followers old men women and children this was the miserable remnant of that magnificent army of six hundred thousand with which godfrey had taken nic a and punished the massacre of walter and his rabble where were all the rest the road was strewn with their bones across the thirsty deserts of asia minor on the plain of doryl um and on the slopes and passes of taurus the crusaders bodies lay unburied while before and within antioch the city of disasters thousands upon thousands were thrown into the river or lay in unhallowed soil but they were not all killed many had returned home among whom were hugh le grand and stephen of blois many had left the main body and gone off in freeanded expeditions of their own to join baldwin and others thus we have heard of wolf the burgundian conqueror of adana presently we find that guymer the pirate of boulogne who joined baldwin at tarsus must have left him again and returned to his piratical ways for we find him in prison at tripoli he was delivered up by the governor of tripoli to the christians after which he appears no more then some had been taken prisoners and purchased their lives by apostacy like rinaldo the italian and those of the captive women who were yet young were dragging out their lives in the turkish harems probably the boys too were spared and those who were young enough to forget their christian blood brought up to be soldiers of the crescent
