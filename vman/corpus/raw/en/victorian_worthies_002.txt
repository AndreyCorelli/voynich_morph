the earnest puritans of the seventeenth century the bible and milton were a peculiar joy no other stories were so moving no other music so thrilling to the ear in his family there was no want of good talk his mother who died in was a woman of great gifts who helped largely in developing the minds of her children after her death john continued to live with his sisters who were clever and original in mind becoming the leader in the home circle where views were freely exchanged on the questions of the day the society of friends was adverse to political discussion as interfering with the religious life but the brights could not be kept from such a field of interest and during these years theirs like many other quiet homes was stirred by the excitement roused by the fortunes of the reform bill the mill too did much to educate him in the rochdale factory there was no marked separation as at manchester between rich and poor master and men lived side by side knew one another family history and fortunes and fraternized over their joys and sorrows even in those days of backward education ld jacob made himself responsible for the schooling of his workmen children his son too made personal friends among those working under him and kept them throughout his life outside the mill rochdale offered opportunities which he readily took in he became one of the founders and first president of a debating society and he began early to address bible meetings and to lecture on temperance in his native town moved by no conscious idea of learning to speak in public but by the simple desire to be useful in good work in such holidays as he took he was eager to travel abroad and to learn more of the outside world and before he started at the age of twentyour on his longest travels a nine months journey to palestine and the eastern mediterranea he had by individual effort fitted himself to hold his own with the best students of the universities in width of outlook and capacity for mastering a subject like them he had his limitations and his prejudices but however we may admire wide toleration in itself depth and intensity of feeling are often of more value to a man in enabling him to influence his fellows the year of queen victoria accession may be counted a landmark in the life of this great victorian then for the first time he met richard cobden who was destined to extend his labours and to share his glory and in the following year he began to coperate actively in the free trade cause attending meetings in the rochdale district and gradually developing his power of speaking it was about this time that he came to know his first wife elizabeth priestman of the society of friends in newcastlenyne a woman of refined nature and rare gifts whom he was to marry in and to lose in then it was that he built the house ne ash facing the same common as the house in which he was born here he lived many years and here he died in the fullness of time a lancashire man content to dwell among his own people in his native town and to forgo the grandeur of a country house it was from here that he was called in the decisive hour of his life to take part in a national work with which his name will ever be associated at the moment when bright was prostrated with grief at his wife death cobden appeared on the scene and made his historic appeal he urged his friend to put aside his private grief to remember the miseries of so many other homes miseries due directly to the corn laws to put his shoulder to the wheel and never to rest till they were repealed cobden had been less happy than bright in his schooling his father misfortune led to his spending five years at a yorkshire school of the worst type and seven more as clerk in the warehouse of an unsympathetic uncle like bright he had early to take the lead in his own family also like bright he had to educate himself but he had a far harder struggle and the enterprise which he showed in commerce in early manhood would have left him the possessor of a vast fortune had he not preferred to devote his energies to public causes the two men were by nature well suited to complement one another if cobden was the more ingenious in explaining an argument bright was more forcible in asserting a principle if cobden could above all other men convince the intellects of his hearers bright could as few other speakers kindle their spirits for a fray his figure on a platform was striking his manly expressive face with broad brow straight nose and square chin was essentially english in type though in the course of his political career he discarded the distinctive quaker dress he never discarded the quaker simplicity his costume was plain his style of speaking severe his bearing dignified and restrained only when his indignation was kindled at injustice was he swept far away from the calmness of quaker tradition the corn laws were a sequel to the napoleonic wars and to the insecurity of foreign trade which these caused while war lasted it had inflated prices and brought to english growers of corn a period of extraordinary prosperity when peace came to escape from a sudden fall in prices the landed proprietors who formed a majority of the house of commons had fixed by act of parliament the conditions under which corn might be imported from abroad this measure was to perpetuate by law in time of peace the artificial conditions from which the people had unavoidably suffered by the accident of war the legislators paid no heed to the growth of population which was enormous or to the distress of the working classes who needed time to adjust themselves to the rapid changes in industry even the middle classes suffered and the poor could only meet such trouble by lemming or selftarvation a noble duke speaking in all good faith advised them to ry a pinch of curry powder in hot water as making the pangs of hunger less intolerable he met with little thanks for his advice from the sufferers who demanded a radical cure parliament as a whole showed few signs of wishing to probe the question more deeply and shut its eyes to the evidence of distress whether shown in peaceful petitions or in disorderly riots many of the members were personally humane men and good landlords but there were no powerful newspapers to enlighten them and they knew little of the state of the manufacturing districts the cause had now found its appropriate champions we in this day are familiar with appeals to the great mass of the people we know the story of midlothian campaigns and belfast reviews we hear the distant thunder from liverpool manchester or birmingham when the great men of parliament go down from london to thrill vast audiences in the provincial towns but the agitation of the antiornaw league was a new thing it was initiated by men unknown outside the manchester district few of the thousands to whom it was directed possessed the vote and yet it wrought one of the greatest changes of the nineteenth century a change of which the influence is perhaps not yet spent in this campaign cobden and bright were without doubt the leading spirits the movement filled five years of bright life his hopes and fears might alternate t one moment he was stirred to exultation over success at another to regrets at the breakp of his home life at another to bitter complaints and hatred of the landed interest ut his exertions never relaxed as he was so often absent the business at rochdale had to be entrusted to his brother whenever he could be there bright was at his home with his little motherless daughter but his efforts on the platform were more and more appreciated each year and the campaign made heavy demands upon him at the opening of the free trade hall in manchester on the site of the eterloo riots he won a signal triumph the vast audience was enthusiastic several of them also were discriminating in their praise one lady said that the chief charm of mr bright was in the simplicity of his manner the total absence of anything like showing off another that she should never attend another meeting if he were announced to speak as she could not bear the excitement simplicity and profound emotion were the secrets of his influence the london opera house saw similar scenes once a month from till the end of the struggle villages and towns and all classes of society were instructed in the principles of the league and induced to help forward the cause not only did the wealthy factory owner conscious as he was of the loss which the high price of food inflicted on the manufacturing interest contribute his thousands the factory hand too contributed his mite to further the welfare of his class even farmers were led to take a new view of the needs of agriculture and the country labourer was made to see that his advantage lay in the success of the league it was a farmand who put the matter in a nutshell at one of the meetings be protected he said nd i be starving in bright joined his leader in parliament as member for durham city though his quaker relatives disapproved of the idea that one of their society should so far enter the world and take part in its conflicts in the house of commons he met with scant popularity but with general respect he was no mob orator of the conventional type the simplicity and good taste of his speeches satisfied the best judges he expressed sentiments hateful to his hearers in such a way that they might dislike the speech but could not despise the speaker even when he boldly attacked the game laws in an assembly of landowners the house listened to him respectfully and the spokesman of the government thanked him for the tone and temper of his speech admitting that he had made out a strong case but it was in the country and on the platform that the chief efforts of cobden and bright were made and their chief successes won in they had an unexpected but most influential ally nature herself took a hand in the game from to the bad effects of the corn laws were mitigated by good harvests and by the wise measures of peel in freeing trade from various restrictions but in first the corn and then the potato crop failed calamitously peel conscience had been uneasy for years he had been studying economics and his conclusions did not square with the orthodox tory creed so when the whig leader lord john russell ventured to express himself openly for free trade in his famous edinburgh letter of november peel at last saw some chance of converting his party it has already been told in this book how at length he succeeded in his aims how he broke up his party but saved the country and how in the hour of mingled triumph and defeat he generously gave to cobden the chief credit for success whigs and tories might taunt one another with desertion of principles or might claim that their respective leaders collaborated at the end certainly the question would never have been put before the cabinet or the house of commons as a government measure but for the untiring efforts of the two tribunes history can show few greater triumphs of government by moral suasion and the art of speech throughout violence had been eschewed even though men were starving and appeals had been made solely to the justice and expediency of their case nothing illustrates better the sincerity and disinterestedness of john bright than his conduct in these last decisive months the tide was flowing with him the opposition was reduced to a shadow he might have enjoyed the luxury of applause from radicals whigs and the more advanced tories and won easy victories over a hostile minority but the cause was now in the safe hands of peel whose honesty they respected and whose generalship they trusted so cobden and bright were content to stand aside and watch instead of carping at his tardy conversion bright wrote in generous praise of peel speech never listened he said o any human being speaking in public with so much delight his heart was in the cause and not in his own advancement when he did rise to speak it was to vindicate peel honour and his statesmanship a few months later this honourable alliance came to an abrupt end bright was forced by the same incorruptible sense of right and by the absence of all respect of persons to oppose peel in the crisis of his fate the government brought in an irish coercion bill which was naturally opposed by the whigs the protectionist tories saw their chance of taking revenge on peel for repealing the corn laws and made common cause with their enemies and from very different motives bright went into the same lobby his conscience forbade him to support any coercive measure no prime minister could please him as much as peel but no surrender no mere evasion of responsibilities was possible in the case of a measure of which he disapproved so firm was the bedock of principle on which bright political conduct was based and it was to this uncompromising sincerity above all that he owed the triumphs of his oratory his method as an orator is full of interest in his youth he had begun by writing out and learning his speeches in full but before he quitted rochdale for a wider theatre he had discarded this rather mechanical method and trusted more freely to his growing powers he still made careful preparation for his speeches he tells us how he often composed them in bed as carlyle ugged brindley wrestled in bed with the difficulties of his canalchemes the silence and the dim light favouring the birth of ideas he prepared words as well as ideas but he only committed to memory enough to be a guide to him in marking the order and development of his thoughts and filled up the original outline according to the inspiration of the moment a few sentences where the balance of words was carefully studied a few figures of speech where his imagination had taken flight into the realm of poetry a few notable illustrations from history or contemporary politics with details of names and figures hese would be found among the notes which he wrote on detached slips of paper and dropped successively into his hat as each milestone was attained as compared with his illustrious rival gladstone he was very sparing of gesture depending partly on facial expression still more on the modulations of his voice to give life to the words which he uttered his reading had formed his diction his constant speaking had taught him readiness and his study of great questions at close quarters and his meditation on them supplied him with the facts and the conclusions which he wished to put forward but the fire which kindled this material to white heat was the passion for great principles which glowed in his heart he himself in in returning thanks for the gift of the freedom of the city of edinburgh quoted with obvious sincerity a sentence from his favourite milton rue eloquence i find to be none but the serious and hearty love of truth note see g trevelyan life of john bright bright public life was in the main a tale of devotion to two great causes the repeal of the corn laws consummated in and the extension of the franchise which was not realized till twenty years later but he found time to examine other questions and to utter shrewd opinions on the government of india and of ireland and to influence english sentiment on the crimean war and the war of secession in the united states in advance of his time he wished to develop cottonrowing in india and so to prevent the great industry of his own district being dependent on america alone he attacked the existing board of directors and preferred immediate control by the crown and while wishing to preserve the viceroy supremacy over the whole he spoke in favour of admitting indians to a larger share in the government of the various provinces many of the best judges of toay are now working towards the same end but at the time he met with little support it is interesting to find that both on india and on ireland similar views were put forward by men so different as john bright and benjamin disraeli mr trevelyan has preserved the memory of several episodes in which they were connected with one another and of attempts which disraeli made to win bright support and coperation bright could cultivate friendships with politicians of very different schools without being induced to deviate by a hair breadth from the cause which his principles dictated and he could treat his friends at times with refreshing frankness when disraeli warmly admired one of his greatest speeches and expressed the wish that he himself could emulate it the outspoken quaker replied ell you might have made it if you had been honest it was the young disraeli who as early as had attributed the irish troubles to starving population an absentee aristocracy and an alien church it was bright who never hesitated when opportunity arose to work for the disestablishment of the church in ireland and for the security of irish tenants in their holdings a succession of measures carried by liberals and conservatives from gladstone to george wyndham have made us familiar with the idea of land purchase in ireland but bright had been there as early as and had learnt for himself though at the end of his life he was a stubborn opponent of gladstone home rule bill he had long ago won the gratitude of ireland as no other englishman of his day and his name has been preserved there in affectionate remembrance in the year of the crimean war bright reached the zenith of his oratorical power and at the same time touched the nadir of his popularity public opinion was setting strongly against russia in stemming the tide of war the soalled anchester school had a difficult task and was severely criticized the idea of the alance of power made little appeal to bright and as a quaker he was reluctant to see england interfering in a quarrel which did not seem to concern her the satirists indeed scoffed unfairly at the doctrine of eace at any price for bright was content to put aside the principle and to argue the case on pure political expediency but his attacks on the wars of the last century were too often couched in an offensive tone with personal references to the peerages won in them and he spoke at times too bitterly of the diplomatic profession and especially of our ambassador at constantinople nothing shows so clearly the danger of the imperfect education which was forced on bright by necessity and which he had done so much to remedy as his attitude to foreign and imperial politics in his home he had too readily imbibed the crude notion that our empire existed to provide careers for the needy cadets of aristocratic families and that our foreign policy was inspired by selfeeking officials who cared little for moral principles or for the lives of their fellow countrymen a few months spent with lord canning at calcutta or with the lawrences at lahore frequent intercourse with men of the calibre of lord lyons or lord cromer would have enlightened him on the subject and prevented him from uttering the unwarranted imputations which he did yet in his great parliamentary speeches of he rose high above all pettiness and made a deep impression on a hostile house damaging though his speech of december was to the government no minister attempted to reply palmerston russell and gladstone with all their power were unequal to the task disraeli told bright that a few more such speeches ould break up the government and delane the famous editor of the times wrote that obden and bright would be our ministers but for their principle of peace at any price but bright was not thinking of office or of breaking up governments he was thinking of the practical end in view his next great speech was on february when a faint hope of peace appeared it was most conciliatory in tone and was a solemn appeal to palmerston to use his influence in ending the war this was known as he angel of death speech from a famous passage which occurs in it at the end he was verloaded with compliments but the minister who was hampered by russian intrigues with napoleon seemed deaf to all appeals and bright again returned to the attack till the last days of the war he continued to raise his voice on behalf of peace but his exertions had told on his strength and for the greater part of two years he had to abandon public life and devote himself to recovering his health six years later he was to prove that eace at any price was no fair description of his attitude the southern states of america seceded on the question of state rights and the institution of slavery and the federal government declared war on them as rebels this time it was not a war for the balance of power but one fought to vindicate a moral principle and bright was strongly in favour of fighting it to a finish for different reasons most of our countrymen favoured the south but he appealed for british sympathy for the other side on the ground that no true briton could abet slavery he was the most prominent supporter of the north for long the only prominent one but he gradually made converts and did much to wipe away the reproach which attached to the name of englishmen in america when the north triumphed in the end the war ended in with the surrender of general lee at appomattox and bright wrote in his journal his great triumph of the republic is the event of our age but long before the question of reform and of the extension of the franchise had been revived gladstone might speak in favour of the principle in russell might introduce a reform bill in a year later disraeli might ish the whigs and whig and tory might wrangle over the question who were the friends of the orking man but bright had made his position clear to his friends in he began a popular movement in and for the next fifteen years of his life it was the object dearest to his heart he was not afraid to walk alone when his old fellow worker cobden refused his aid on the ground that he was not convinced of the need for extending the franchise bright himself assumed the lead and bore the brunt of the battle till his main obstacle was palmerston who since he took the helm in the worst days of the crimean war and conducted the ship of state into harbour occupied an impregnable position palmerston was dear to he man in the street shared his prejudices and understood his humours and nothing could make him into a serious democrat or reformer even after palmerston death bright chief opponent was to be found in the whig ranks in robert lowe who was a master of parliamentary eloquence and who managed in to wreck lord john russell reform bill in the house but bright had his revenge in the country such meetings as ensued in the great provincial towns had not been seen for twenty years the middle class and the artisans were fused as in the great repeal struggle of at glasgow as many as men paraded outside the town and no hall could contain the thousands who wished to hear the great tribune he claimed that eightyour per cent of his countrymen were still excluded from the vote and he bluntly asserted that the existing house of commons did not represent he intelligence and the justice of the nation but the prejudices the privileges and the selfishness of a class but however blind many of this class might still be to the signs of the times they found an astute leader in disraeli who had few principles and could trim his sails to any wind the tory reform bill which he put forward in february came out a very different bill in july after discussion in the cabinet which led to the resignation of three ministers and after debates in the house of commons where it was roughly handled the principle of household suffrage was conceded and another million voters were added to the electorate disraeli had made a greater change of front than any which he could attribute to peel and that without conviction for reasons of party expediency the real triumph belonged to bright he bill adopted he writes s the precise franchise i recommended in he had not only roused the country by his platform speeches he had carefully watched the bill in all its stages through the house and gradually transformed it till it satisfied the aspirations of the people he had been content to work with disraeli so long as he could further the cause of reform and he only quarrelled with that statesman finally when in he revived the antiussian policy of palmerston during this strenuous time his domestic life was happy and tranquil after the death of his first wife he had remained a widower for six years and in he had married margaret leatham who bore him seven children and shared his joys and sorrows in no ordinary measure for thirty years whenever politics took him away from his rochdale home he wrote constantly to her and his letters throw most valuable light on his inmost feelings she died in and after this his life was pitched in a different key the outer world might suppose that high political office was crowning his career but his enthusiasm and his power were ebbing and his physical health failed him more than once he was as affectionate to his children as friendly to his neighbours as true to his principles but the old fire was gone the outward events of his life from to must be passed over lightly against his own wishes he was persuaded by gladstone to join the cabinet in and again in his name was a tower of strength to the government with the newlynfranchised electors but he himself had little taste for the routine of office at birmingham for which he had sat since he compared himself to the shunammite woman who refused the offer of advancement at court and replied to the prophet dwell among mine own people but events were too strong for him he was drawn first to westminster to share in the government of the country and then to osborne to visit the queen both the queen and he were nervous at the prospect but the interview passed off happily family affections and sorrows were a bond between them and he talked to her with his usual frankness and simplicity even the difficult question of costume was settled by a compromise and the usual goldraided livery was replaced by a sober suit of black ministerial work in london might have proved irksome to him but his colleagues in the cabinet were indulgent and no excessive demands were made upon his strength it was recognized that bright was no longer in the fighting line in he was incapacitated by a second long illness and he had little share in the measures carried through parliament for irish land purchase and national education note see fitzmaurice life of lord granville vol i p his official career was finally closed in when the bombardment of alexandria seemed to open a new and aggressive chapter in our eastern policy bright was true to his old principles and resigned office he severed himself still more from the official liberals in when he refused to follow gladstone into the home rule camp he disliked the methods of parnell the obstruction in parliament and the campaign of lawlessness in ireland his own victories had not been won so and he had a great respect for the traditions of the house he also believed that the home rule bill would vitally weaken the unity of the realm but no personal bitterness entered into his relations with his old colleagues he did not attack gladstone as he had attacked palmerston in from his deathed he sent a cordial message to his old chief and received an answer full of high courtesy and affection his illness lasted several months from the autumn of he lay at one ash weak but not suffering acutely and on march he quietly passed away his old friend cobden had preceded him more than twenty years having died in and had been buried at his birthplace in sussex where he had made himself a peaceful home in later life bright proved himself equally faithful to the home of his earliest years he was laid to rest in the small buryinground in front of the friends meetingouse where he had worshipped as a child in his long career he had served noble causes and scaled the heights of fame and the crowds at his funeral testified to the love which his neighbours bore him he had never willingly been absent for long from his native town his life compared with that of disraeli or gladstone seems almost bleak in its simplicity varied as it was by so few excursions into other fields but two strong passions enriched it with warmth and glow his family affections and his zeal for the common good these filled his heart and he was content that it should be so type of the wise who soar but never roam true to the kindred points of heaven and home illustration charles dickens from the painting by daniel maclise in the national portrait galler charles dickens born at landport

readings in america april collapse at chester readings stopped dies at gadshill june charles dickens novelist and social reformer in these days when critics so often repeat the cry of rt for art sake and denounce ruskin for bringing moral canons into his judgements of pictures or buildings it is dangerous to couple these two titles together and to label dickens as anything but a novelist pure and simple and indeed all would admit that the creator of sam weller and sarah gamp will live when the crusade against umbledom and its abuses is forgotten and the need for such a crusade seems incredible but when so many recent critics have done justice to his gifts as a creative artist this aspect of his work runs no danger of being forgotten moreover when we are considering dickens as a victorian worthy and as a representative man of his age it is desirable to bring out those qualities which he shared with so many of his great contemporaries above all we must remember that dickens himself would be the last man to be ashamed of having written ith a purpose or to think that the fact should be concealed as a blemish in his art there was nothing in which he felt more genuine pride than in the thought that his talents thus employed had brought public opinion to realize the need for many practical reforms in our social condition if these old abuses have mostly passed away we may be thankful indeed but we cannot feel sure that in the future fresh abuses will not arise with which the example of dickens may inspire others to wage war his was a strenuous life he never spared himself nor stinted his efforts in any cause for which he was fighting and if he did not win complete victory in his lifetime he created the spirit in which victory was to be won charles dickens was born in the second child of a large family his father being at the time a navy clerk employed at portsmouth of his birthplace in commercial road portsmouth is justifiably proud but we must think of him rather as a kentishman and a londoner since he never lived in hampshire after his fourth year the earliest years which left a distinct impress on his mind were those passed at chatham to which his father moved in this town and its neighbouring cathedral city of rochester with their narrow old streets their riverside and dockyard took firm hold of his memory and imagination toay no places speak more intimately of him to the readers of his books here he passed five years of happy childhood till his father work took the family to london and his father improvidence plunged them into misfortune for those who know wilkins micawber it is needless to describe the failings of mr dickens for others we may be content to say that he was kindhearted sanguine and improvident quite incapable of the steady industry needed to support a growing family when his debts overwhelmed him and he was carried off to the marshalsea prison charles was only ten years old but already he took the lead in the house on him fell the duty of pacifying creditors at the door and of making visits to the pawnroker to meet the daily needs of the household his initiation into life was a hard one and it began cruelly soon if he was active and enterprising beyond his years with his nervous hightrung temperament he was capable of suffering acutely and this capacity was now to be sorely tried for a year or more of his life this proud sensitive child had to spend long hours in the cellars of a warehouse with rough uneducated companions occupied in pasting labels on pots of bootlacking this situation was all that the influence of his family could procure for him and into this he was thrust at the age of ten with no ray of hope no expectation of release his shiftless parents seemed to acquiesce in this drudgery as an opening for their cleverest son and instead of their helping and comforting him in his sorrow it was he who gave his sundays to visiting them in prison and to offering them such consolation as he could the iron burnt deep into his soul long after in fact till the day when the district was rebuilt and changed out of knowledge he owned that he could not bear to revisit the scene so painful were his recollections so vivid his sense of degradation twentyive years later he narrated the facts to his friend and biographer john forster in a private conversation and he only recurred to the subject once more when under the disguise of a novel he told the story of the childhood of david copperfield by shifting the horror from the realm of fact to that of fiction perhaps he lifted the weight of it from the secret recesses of his heart when his father debts were relieved the child regained his freedom from servitude but even then his schooling was desultory and ineffective well might the elder dickens in a burst of candour say to a stranger who asked him about his son education hy indeed sir ha ha he may be said to have educated himself at the age of fifteen charles embarked again on his career as a wagearner at first he was taken into a lawyer office where he filled a position somewhat between that of officeoy and clerk and two years later he was qualifying himself by the study of shorthand for the profession of a parliamentary reporter which his father was then following he entered he gallery in first representing the true sun and later the wellnown morning chronicle and at intervals he enlarged his experiences by journeys into the provinces to report political meetings thus it was that he familiarized himself with the mail coaches the wayside hostelries and the rich variety of types that were to be found there with london in most of its phases he was already at home so when in he made his first attempts at writing in periodical literature although he was only twentywo years old he had a wealth of firstand experiences quite outside the range of the man who is just finishing his leisurely passage through a public school and university of schools and offices of parliaments and prisons of the street and of the high road he had been a diligent and observant critic for many years he had practised the maxim of pope he proper study of mankind is man friends sprang up wherever he went his open face his sparkling eye his humorous tongue his ready sympathy were a passport to the goodwill of those whom he met few could resist the appeal many readers will be familiar with the early portrait by maclise but his friends tell us how little that did justice to the lively play of feature he spirited air and carriage which were indescribable on the top of a mail coach on a fresh morning they must have won the favour of his fellow travellers more easily than alfred jingle won the hearts of the pickwickians and beneath the radiant cheerfulness of his manner the quick flash of observation and of speech there was in him an element of hard persistence and determination which would carry him far if the years of poverty and neglect had failed to chill his hopes and break his spirit there was no fear that he would tire in the pursuit of his ambition when fortune began to smile upon him he had touched life on many sides he had kept his warmth of sympathy his buoyancy his capacity for rising superior to illortune and the years of adversity had only deepened his feeling for all that were oppressed he had much to learn about the craft of letters but he already had the first essential of an author e had something to say the year is a definite landmark in the life of dickens in this year he married in this year he gave up the practice of parliamentary reporting published the sketches by boz and began the writing of the pickwick papers this immortal work achieved wide popularity at once criticism cannot hope to do justice to the greatness of sam weller to the humours of dingley dell and eatanswill to the adventures of the hero in back gardens or in prison on coaches or in wheelbarrows every one must read them in the original for himself in this book dickens reached at once the height of his success in making his fellow countrymen laugh with him at their own foibles if in the art of constructing a story in the depiction of character in deepening the interest by the alternation of happiness and misfortune he was to go far beyond his initial triumph till with many dickensians who love him chiefly for his liveliness of observation and broad humour pickwick remains the prime favourite the effect of this success on the fortunes of the author was immediate and lasting henceforth he could live in a comfortable house and look forward to a family life in which his children should be free from all risk of repeating his own experience he could afford himself the pleasures and the society which he needed and he became the centre of a circle of friends who appreciated his talents and encouraged him in his career his relations with his publishers though not without incident were generally of the most cordial kind if dickens had the selfonfidence to estimate his own powers highly and the shrewd instinct to know when he was getting less than his fair share in a bargain yet in a difference of opinion he was capable of seeing the other side and he was loyal in the observance of all agreements the five years which followed were so crowded with various activities that it is difficult to date the events exactly especially when he was producing novels in monthly or weekly numbers generally he had more than one story on the stocks thus in before pickwick was finished oliver twist was begun and it was not itself complete before the earlier numbers of nicholas nickleby were appearing in the same way the old curiosity shop and barnaby rudge which may be dated and overlapped one another in the planning of the stories if not in the execution of the weekly parts there is no period of dickens life which enables us better to observe his intense mental activity and at the same time the variety of his creations here we have the luxuriant humour of mrs nickleby and the crummles family side by side with the tragedy of bill sikes and the pathos of little nell here also we can see the gradual development of constructive power in the handling of the story but for our purpose it is more significant to notice that we here find dickens pen enlisted in the service of the noblest cause for which he fought the redemption from misery and slavery of the children of his native land lord shaftesbury life has told us what their sufferings were and how the machinery of government was slowly forced to do its part and dickens would be the last to detract from the fame of that great philanthropist whose efforts on many occasions he supported and praised but there were wide circles which no philanthropist could reach hearts which no arguments or statistics could rouse men and women who attended no meetings and read no pamphlets but who eagerly devoured anything that was written by the author of the pickwick papers to them smike and little nell made a personal and irresistible appeal they could not remain insensible to the cruelty of dotheboys hall and to the depravity of fagin school and if these books did not themselves recruit active workers to improve the conditions of child life at least society became permeated with a temper which was favourable to the efforts of the reformers as far back as the days of his childhood at rochester dickens had been indignant at what he had casually heard of the yorkshire schools and his year of drudgery in london had made him realize in other cases beside his own the degradation that followed from the neglect of children on undertaking to handle this subject in nicholas nickleby he journeyed to yorkshire to gather evidence at first hand for his picture of dotheboys hall and for many years afterwards he continued to correspond with active workers on the subject of ragged schools and on the means of uplifting children out of the conditions which were so fruitful a source of crime he discovered for himself how easily miscreants like fagin could find recruits in the slums of london and how impossible it was to bring up aright boys who were bred in these neglected homes even where efforts had been begun the machinery was quite inadequate the teachers few the schoolrooms cheerless and illquipped mr crotch has preserved a letter of in which dickens makes the practical offer of providing funds for a washinglace in one school where the children seemed to be suffering from inattention to the elementary needs his heart warmed towards individual cases and he faced them in practical fashion he was not one of those reformers who utter benevolent sentiments on the platform and go no further note charles dickens social reformer by w w crotch chapman hall p critics have had much to say about dickens treatment of child characters in his novels the words entimental and awkish have been hurled at scenes like the death of paul dombey and little nell and at the more lurid episodes in oliver twist but dickens was a pioneer in his treatment of children in fiction and if he did smite resounding blows which jar upon critical ears at least he opened a rich vein of literature where many have followed him he wrote not for the critics but for the great popular audience whom he had created comprising all ages and classes and worldide in extent the best answer to such criticism is to be found in the poem which bret harte dedicated to his memory in which beautifully describes how the pathos of his childeroine could move the hearts of rough working men far away in the sierras of the west nor did this same character of little nell fail to win special praise from literary critics so fastidious as landor and francis jeffrey in he embarked on his first voyage to america till then he had travelled little outside his native land and this expedition was definitely intended to bear fruit before starting he made a bargain with his publishers to produce a book on his return the american notes thus published dealing largely with institutions and with the notable ights of the country have not retained a prominent place among his works with martin chuzzlewit and its picture of american manners it is different this stands alone among his writings in having left a permanent heritage of illill reasons in abundance can be found for the bitterness caused he portrayed the conceit the selfnterest the disregard for the feelings of others which the lessducated american showed to foreigners in a visible and often offensive guise and the portraits were so lifeike that no arrow fails to hit the mark the american people were young they had made great strides in material prosperity they had not been taught to submit to the lash by satirists like swift or more kindly mentors like addison their own oliver wendell holmes had not yet begun to chastise them with gentle irony so they were aghast at dickens audacity and indignant at what seemed an outrage on their hospitality and few stopped to ask what elements of truth were to be found in the offending book no doubt it was oneided and unfair dickens like most tourists had been confronted by the louder and more aggressive members of the community and had not time to judge the whole in large measure he recanted in subsequent writings and on his second visit the more generous americans showed how little rancour they bore but the portraits of jefferson brick and elijah pogram will live with pecksniff airey gamp and other immortals they bear the hallark of dickens creative genius to america he did not go again for twentyive years but as he grew older he seemed to feel increasing need for change and variety in his mode of life in he went for nearly twelve months to italy making his headuarters at genoa and in he repeated the experiment at lausanne on the lake of geneva later between and he spent a large part of three summers in a villa near boulogne though he desired the change for reasons connected with his work and though in each case he formed friendly connexions with his neighbours it cannot be said that his books show the influence of either country his genius was british to the core and he remained an englishman wherever he went he complained when abroad that he missed the stimulus of london where the lighted streets through which he walked at night caused his imagination to work with intensified force but even in genoa he proved capable of writing the chimes which is as markedly english in temper as anything which he wrote the same spirit of restlessness comes out in his ventures into other fields of activity at home at one time he assumed the editorship of a london newspaper but a few weeks showed that he was incapable of editorial drudgery and he resigned his taste for acting played a larger part in his life and in and other years he put an enormous amount of energy into organizing public theatrical performances with his friends in london he always loved the theatre macready was one of his innermost circle and he had other friends on the stage indeed there were moments in his life when it seemed that the genius of the novelist might be lost to the world which would have found but a sorry equivalent in one more actor of talent on the stage however brilliant that talent was but the main current of his life went on in london with diligent application to the book or books in hand or at broadstairs where dickens made holiday in true english fashion with his children by the sea in the years following the american voyage the chief landmarks were the production of dombey and son begun in and david copperfield begun in from many points of view they may be regarded as his masterpieces where his art is best seen in depicting character and constructing a story though the infectious gaiety of the earlier novels may at times be missed dickens insight into human nature had ripened and he had learnt to group his lesser figures and episodes more skilfully round the central plot and david copperfield has the peculiar interest which attaches to those works where we seem to read the story of the author own life evidently we have memories here of his childhood of his schoolays and his apprenticeship to work and of the first gleams of success which met him in life it is generally assumed that the book throws light on his own family relations but it would be rash to argue confidently about this as the inventive impulse was so strong in him at least we may say that it is the book most necessary for a student who wishes to understand dickens himself and his outlook on the world also david copperfield may be regarded as the central point and the culmination of dickens career as a novelist before it and again after it he had a spell of about fifteen years steady work at novel writing and no one would question that the first spell was productive of the better work bleak house hard times little dorrit our mutual friend all show evidence of greater effort and are less happy in their effect no man could live the life that dickens had lived for fifteen years and not show some signs of exhaustion the wonder is that his creative power continued at all he was capable of brilliant successes yet the tale of two cities is among the most thrilling of his stories while edwin drood and parts of great expectations show as fine imagination and character drawing as anything which he wrote before but there is no injustice in drawing a broad distinction between the two parts of his career his home during the most fertile period of his activity was in devonshire terrace near regent park a house with a garden of considerable size here he was within reach of his best friends who were drawn from all the liberal professions represented in london first among them stands john forster lawyer journalist and author his adviser and subsequently his biographer the friend of robert browning a man with a genius for friendship unselfish loyal discreet and wise in counsel next came the artists maclise and clarkson stanfield the actor macready talfourd lawyer and poet douglas jerrold and mark lemon the two famous contributors to punch and some fellow novelists of whom harrison ainsworth was conspicuous in the earlier group and wilkie collins in later years less frequent visitors were carlyle thackeray and bulwer lytton but they too were proud to welcome dickens among their friends with some of these he would walk ride or dine go to the theatre or travel in the provinces and in foreign countries his biographer loves to recall the dickens dinners organized to celebrate the issue of a new book when songs and speeches were added to good cheer and when e all in the greatest goodumour glorified each other dickens always retained the english taste for a good dinner and was frankly fond of applause and there was no element of exclusive priggishness about the cordial admiration which these friends felt for one another and their peculiar enthusiasm for dickens and his books around him the enthusiasm gathered and few men have better deserved it when he was writing he needed quiet and worked with complete concentration and when he had earned some leisure he loved to spend it in violent physical exercise he would suddenly call on forster to come out for a long ride on horseback to occupy the middle of the day and his diligent friend unable to resist the lure of such company would throw his own work to the winds and come till near the end of his life dickens clung to these habits thinking nothing of a walk of from twenty to thirty miles and there seems reason to believe that by constant overxertion he sapped his strength and shortened his life but lameness in one foot the result of an illness early in handicapped him severely at times and in the same year he sustained a rude shock in a railway accident where his nerves were upset by what he witnessed in helping the injured he ought to have acquired the wisdom of the middleged man and to have taken things more easily but with him it was impossible to be doing nothing physical and mental activity succeeded one another and often went together with a high state of nervous tension this love of excitement sometimes took forms which modern taste would call excessive and unwholesome his attendance at the public execution of the mannings in his going so often to the morgue in paris his visit to america to he exact site where professor webster did that amazing murder may seem legitimate for one who had to study crime among the other departments of life but at times he revels in gruesome details in a way which jars on our feeling and betrays too theatrical a love of sensation however no one could say that dickens is generally morbid in view of the sound and hearty appreciation which he had for all that is wholesome and genial in life in many ways the latter part of his life shows a less even tenor a less steady development though he was so domestic in his tastes and devoted to his children his relations with his wife became more and more difficult owing to incompatibility of temperament and from they found it desirable to live apart this no doubt added to his restlessness and the craving for excitement which showed itself in the ardour with which he took up the idea of public readings these readings are only less famous than his writings so prodigious was their success his great dramatic gifts enlisted in the service of his own creations made an irresistible appeal to the public and till the day of his collapse ten years later their popularity showed no sign of waning the amount of money which he earned thereby was amazing the american tour alone gave him a net profit of and he expected to make as much more in two seasons in england but he paid dearly for these triumphs being often in trouble with his voice suffering from fits of sleeplessness aggravating the pain in his foot and affecting his heart in spite then of the success of the readings his faithful friends like forster would gladly have seen him abandon a practice which could add little to his future fame while it threatened to shorten his life but however arduous the task which he set himself when the moment came dickens could brace himself to meet the demands and satisfy the high expectations of his audience his nerves seemed to harden his voice to gain strength his spirit flashed out undimmed and he won triumph after triumph in quiet cathedral cities in great industrial towns in the more fatiguing climate of america and before the huge audiences of philadelphia and new york he began his programme with a few chosen pieces from pickwick and the christmas books and with selected characters like paul dombey and mrs gamp he added dotheboys hall and the story of david copperfield in brief in his last series against the advice of forster he worked up the more sensational passages from oliver twist his object he says was o leave behind me the recollection of something very passionate and dramatic done with simple means if the act would justify the theme it was because the art of reading was unduly strained that forster protested and his judgement is confirmed by dickens boast perhaps humorously exaggerate that t clifton we had a contagion of fainting and yet the place was not hot dozen to twenty ladies taken out stiff and rigid at various times the physical effects of this fresh strain soon appeared after a month his doctor ordered him to cease reading and though he resumed it after a few days rest in april he had a worse attack of giddiness and was obliged to abandon it permanently the history of these readings illustrates the character of dickens perhaps better than any other episode in his later life but the same restless energy is visible even in his life at gadshill which was his home from to the house lies on the london road a few miles west of rochester and can easily be seen toay almost unaltered by the passery it had caught his fancy in his childhood before the age of ten when he was walking with his father and his father had promised that if he would only work hard enough he might one day live in it the associations of the place with the falstaff scenes in henry had also endeared it to him and so when in he heard that it was for sale he jumped at the opportunity for some years after purchasing it he let it to tenants but from he made it his permanent abode it has no architectural features to charm the eye with its many changes and additions made for comfort its bowindows and the plantations in the garden it is a typical victorian home here dickens could live at ease surrounded by his children his dogs his books his souvenirs of his friends and the kentish scenery which he loved to the north lay the flat marshlands of the lower thames to the south and west lay rolling hills crowned with woodlands with hop gardens on the lower slopes to the east lay the valley of the medway with the quaint old streets of rochester and the bustling dockyard of chatham all that makes the familiar beauty and richness of english landscape was here above all the charm of associations so many names preserved memories of his books to rochester the pickwickians had driven on their first search for knowledge to cobham mr winkle had fled and at the eather bottle his friends had found him in the marshlands joe gargery and pip had watched for the escaped convict in the old gateway by the cathedral jasper had entertained edwin drood on the eve of his disappearance along that very highoad over which dickens windows looked the child david copperfield had tramped in his journey from london to dover meanwhile though his creative vein may have been less fertile than of old his efforts for the good of his fellow men were no less continuous and sincere his first books had aimed at killing by ridicule certain social institutions which had sunk into abuses the pictures of parliamentary elections of schools of workhouses had not only created a hearty laugh but they had disposed the public to listen to the reformers and to realize the need for reform as he grew older he went deeper into the evil and he also blended his reforming purpose better with his story the characters of mr dombey and the chuzzlewits are not mere incidents in the tale nor are they monstrosities which call forth immediate astonishment and horror but in each case the ingrained selfishness which spreads misery through a family is the very mainspring of the story and the dramatic power by which dickens makes it reveal itself in action has something shakespearian in it here there is still a balance between the different elements the human interest and the moral lesson and as works of art they are on a higher plane than hard times where the purpose is too clearly shown still if we wish to understand this side of dickens work it is just such a book as hard times that we must study it deals with the relation of classes to one another in an industrial district and especially with the faults of the class that rose to power with the development of manufacturing mr gradgrind and mr bounderby the welleaning pedant and the offensive parvenu preach the same gospel political economy as they understand it is to rule life and this dismal science is not concerned with human welleing and happiness but only with the profit and loss on commercial undertakings hard facts then are to be the staple of education memory and accurate calculation are to be cultivated the imagination is to be driven out in depicting the manner of this education dickens rather overshoots the mark the visit of mr gradgrind to mr mhoakumchild school when the sharpitted bitzer defines the horse according to the scientific handbook while poor cissy who has only an affection for horses indulges in fancies and collapses in disgrac is too evident a caricature but the effects of this kind of teaching are painted with a powerful hand and we see the faculty for joy blighted almost in the cradle and the lesson is enforced not only by the working man and his family but by gradgrind own daughter who pitilessly convicts her father of having stifled every generous impulse in her and of having sacrificed her on the altar of fancied selfnterest side by side with the dismal mr gradgrind is the poor master of the strolling circus mr sleary with his truer philosophy of life he can see the real need that men have for amusement and for brightness in their lives and though he lives under the shadow of bankruptcy he can hold his head up and preach the gospel of happiness this was a cause which never failed to win the enthusiastic advocacy of dickens he fought as men still have to fight toay against those pharisees who prescribe for the working classes how they should spend their weekly day of freedom he supported the opening on sunday of parks museums and galleries wholeeartedly he loved the theatre and the circus and he wished as many as possible to share those delights in defiance of rs grundy he ventured to maintain that the words usicall and ublicouse rightly understood should be held in honour it is one thing to hate drunkenness and indecency it is quite another to assume that these must be found in the poor man place of recreation and this roused him to anger to him ublicouse meant a place of fellowship and usicall a place of song and mirth and if some critics complain of an excess of material goodheer in his picture of life dickens is certainly here in sympathy with the bulk of his fellowountrymen another cause in which dickens was always ready to lead a crusade was the amendment of the poor law this will remind us of the early days of oliver twist of such a friendless outcast as jo in bleak house of the struggle of betty higden in our mutual friend and her determination never to be given up to he parish but even more than the famous novels the casual writings of dickens in his own magazines and elsewhere throw light on his activities in this cause and on the researches which he made into the working of the system mr crotch describes visits which he paid to the workhouses in wapping and whitechapel quoting his comments on the oul ward in one on the old men ward in the other and on the torpor of despair which settled down on these poor wrecks of humanity could such a system he asked himself be wise which robbed men not of liberty alone but of all hope for the future which left them no single point of interest except the statistics of their fellows who had gone before them and who had been finally liberated by death a still more striking passage just because dickens here shows unusual restraint and moderation in his language tells us of the five women whom he saw sleeping all night outside the workhouse through no fault of any official but simply because there was no room for them inside and because society had nothing to offer no form of elief which could touch these unfortunates many will be familiar with passages in ruskin where he denounces similar tragedies due to our inhuman disregard of what is happening at our doors though the most valuable part of his work was the effective appeal to the hearts of his brother men dickens had the practical wisdom to suggest definite remedies in some cases he saw that the districts in the east end of london even with a heavy poor rate failed to supply adequate relief for their waifs and strays while the wealthy inhabitants of the west end having few paupers paid on their riches a rate that was negligible and he boldly suggested the equalization of rates all london should jointly share the burden of maintaining those for whose welfare they were responsible and should pay shares proportioned to their wealth this wise reform was not carried into effect till some thirty or forty years later but the principle is now generally accepted though in this case as in his famous attack on the court of chancery in bleak house dickens failed in obtaining any immediate effect it is unquestionable that he influenced the minds of thousands and changed the temper in which they looked at the problem of the poor in this nothing that he wrote was more powerful than the series of christmas books in which his imagination with the power of a rembrandt threw on to a smaller canvas the lights and shades of london life the grim background of mean streets and the cheerful virtues which throw a glamour over their humble homes his advocacy of these social causes came to be known far and wide and contributed a second element to the popularity won by his novels long before his death dickens stood on a pinnacle alone loved by the vast reading public among those who toil in our towns and villages and wherever english is read and understood he was not only their entertainer but their friend and brother he had been through his days of sorrow and suffering and he had kept that vast fund of cheerfulness which overflowed into his books and gladdened the lives of so many thousands when he died in after a year of intermittent illness following on his breakdown over the public readings there was naturally a widespread desire that he should be buried in westminster abbey as a great englishman and a true representative of his age during life he had expressed his desire for a private funeral unheralded in the press and he had thought of two or three quiet churches in the neighbourhood of rochester and gadshill these particular graveyards were found to be already closed and the family consented to a compromise by which their father should be buried in the abbey at an early hour when no strangers would be aware of it after his body was laid to rest the people were admitted to pay their homage the universality and the sincerity of their feelings was shown in a wonderful way among men of letters he had reigned in the hearts of the people as queen victoria reigned among our sovereigns in the annals of her reign his name will outlive those of soldiers of prelates and of politicians the causes for which he fought have not all been won yet officialdom still dawdles over the work of the state hearts are still broken by the law delays the path of crime still lies too easily open to the young vast progress has been made a humane spirit is to be found in the working of our government and a truer knowledge of social problems is spreading among all classes but the world cannot afford to relegate charles dickens to oblivion and shows no desire to do so his books are and will be a wellspring of cheerfulness of faith in human nature and of true christian charity from which all will do well to drink alfred tennyson born at somersby lincolnshire august at school at louth educated at home poems by two brothers charles and alfred trinity college

october funeral at westminster abbey tennyson poet the victorians as a whole were a generation of fighters they battled against nature forces subduing floods and mountain barriers pestilence and the worst extremes of heat and cold they also went forth into the marketlace and battled with their fellow men for laws for tariffs for empire their triumphs like those of the romans are mostly to be seen in the practical sphere but there were others of that day who chose the contemplative life of the recluse and who yet by high imaginings contributed in no less degree to enrich the fame of their age and among these the first name is that of alfred tennyson the most representative of victorian poets illustration alfred lord tennyson from the painting by g f watts in the national portrait galler his early environment may be said to have marked him out for such a life he was born in one of the remotest districts of a rural county the village of somersby lies in a hollow among the lincolnshire wolds twenty miles east of lincoln midway between the small towns of spilsby horncastle and louth there are no railways to disturb its peace no high roads or broad rivers to bring trade to its doors the old rivulet that rises just above the village flows down some twenty miles to lose itself in the sea near skegness in the valley the alders sigh and the aspens quiver while around are rolling hills covered by long fields of corn broken by occasional spinneys it is not a country to draw tourists for its own sake but tennyson knew as few other poets know the charm that human association lends to the simplest english landscape and he cherished the memory of these scenes long after he had gone to live among the richer beauties of the south from the garners of memory he drew the familiar features of this homely land showing that he had forgotten no grey old grange or lonely fold or low morass and whispering reed or simple stile from mead to mead or sheepwalk up the winding wold note in memoriam there are days when the wolds seem dreary and monotonous but if change is wanted a long walk or an easy drive will take us from somersby as it often took the tennyson brothers to the coast at mablethorpe where the long rollers of the north sea beat upon the sandhills that guard the flat stretches of the marshland here the poet as a child used to lie upon the beach his imagination conjuring up homeric pictures of the grecian fleet besieging troy and if on his last visit before leaving lincolnshire he found the spell broken he could still describe vividly what he saw with the less fanciful vision of manhood grey sandbanks and pale sunsets dreary wind dim shores dense rains and heavylouded sea note lines written in and published in the manchester athen um album these wide expanses of sea sand and sky figure many times in his poetry and furnish a background for the more tragic scenes in the idylls of the king nor does the vicarage spoil the harmony of the scene an oldashioned low rambling house to which a loftier hall adjoining with its gothic windows lends a touch of distinction the garden with one towering sycamore and the wychlms that threw long shadows on the lawn opened on to the parson field where on summer mornings could be heard the sweep of the scythe in the dewy grass here tennyson father had been rector for some years when his fourth child alfred was born in august the year which also saw the birth of darwin and gladstone the family was a large one there were eight sons and four daughters the last of whom was still alive in alfred education was as irregular as a poet could need to be consisting of a few years attendance at louth grammar school where he suffered from the rod and other abuses of the past and of a larger number spent in studying literature at home under his father guidance these left him a liberal amount of leisure which he devoted to reading at large and roaming the countryide his father was a man of mental cultivation far beyond the average well fitted to expand the mind of a boy of literary tastes and to lead him on at a pace suited to his abilities he had suffered from disappointments which had thrown a shadow over his life having been disinherited capriciously by his father who was a wealthy man and a member of parliament the inheritance passed to the second brother who took the name of tennyson dyncourt and though the rector resented the injustice of the act he did not allow it to embitter the relations between his own children and their cousins his character was of the stern dominating order and both his parishioners and his children stood in awe of him but the gentle nature of their mother made amends she is described by edward fitzgerald the poet friend as ne of the most innocent and tenderearted ladies i ever met devoted to husband and children in her youth she had been a noted beauty and in her old age was not too unworldly to remember that she had received twentyive proposals of marriage it was from her that the family derived their beauty of feature while in their strength of intellect they resembled rather their father one of alfred earliest literary passions was a love of byron and he remembered in after life how as a child he had carved on a rock the woful tidings that his hero was dead in this period he was already writing poetry himself though he did not publish his first volume till after he had gone up to cambridge from this home life filled with leisurely reading rambling and dreaming he was sent in to join his brother frederick at trinity college cambridge and he came into residence in february of that year cambridge has been called the poets university here in early days came spenser and milton dryden and gray and n the generation preceding tennyson ordsworth coleridge and byron had followed in their steps however little we can trace directly the development of the poetic gift to local influence at least we can say that tennyson gained greatly by the time he spent within its walls he came up an unknown man without family connexions to help him and without the hallark of any famous school upon him shy and retiring by nature as he was he might easily have failed to win his way to notice but there was something in his appearance in his manner and in the personality that lay behind which never failed to impress observers and gradually he attached to himself the most brilliant undergraduates of his time and became a leader among them thackeray and fitzgerald were in residence but it was not till later that he came to know them well and we hear more of spedding the editor of baco of alford and merivale deans of canterbury and el of trench archbishop of dubli of lushington who married one of his sisters and of arthur hallam who was engaged to another sister at the time of his early death hallam came from eton where his greatest friend had been w e gladstone and he had not been long at cambridge before he was led by kindred tastes and kindred nature into close friendship with tennyson in the judgement of all who knew him a career of the highest usefulness and distinction was assured to him his intellectual force and his high aspirations would have shone in the public service and at least they won him thus early the affection of the noblest among his compeers and a fame that is almost unique in english literature much has been written about the society which these young men formed and which they called he apostles the name has been thought to suggest a certain complacency and mutual admiration but enough letters and personal recollections of their talk have been preserved to show how simple and unaffected the members were in their intercourse with one another they had their enthusiasms but they had also their jests their humour was not perhaps the boisterous fun of william morris and rossetti but it was lively and buoyant enough to banish all suspicion of priggishness just because their enthusiasm was for the best in literature and art tennyson was quickly at home among them already he had learnt at home to love shakespeare and milton coleridge and keats and no effort was required in this circle of friends to keep his reading upon this high level lycidas was always a special favourite of tennyson and appreciation of it seemed to him a sure ouchstone of poetic taste in conversation he did not tend to declaim or monopolize the talk he was noted rather for short sayings and for criticisms tersely expressed he had his moods contemplative genial or gay but all his utterances were marked by independence of thought and his silence could be richer than the speech of other men but for display he had no liking in fact so reluctant was he to face an audience of strangers that when in it was his duty to recite his prize poem in the senateouse he obtained leave for merivale to read it on his behalf on the other hand he was ready enough to impart to his real friends the poems that he wrote from time to time and he would pass pleasant hours with them reciting old ballads and reading aloud the plays of shakespeare his sonorous voice his imagination and his feeling for all the niceties of rhythm made his reading unusually impressive as we know from the testimony of many who heard him the course of his education is in fact more truly to be found in this free companionship than in the lecture room or the examination hall his opinion of the teaching which he received from the dons was formed and expressed in a sonnet of though he refrained from publishing it for half a century he addresses them as ou that do profess to teach and teach us nothing feeding not the heart nd complains of their indifference to the movements of their own age and to the needs of their pupils for despite the ferment which was spreading in the realms of theology of politics and of natural science the dons still taught their classics in the dry pedantic manner of the past and refused to face the problems of the nineteenth century for tennyson whose mind was already capacious and deep these problems had a constant attraction and he had to fall back upon solitary musings and on talks with hallam and other friends partly perhaps because he missed the more rigorous training of the schools we have to wait another ten years before we see marks of his deeper thinking in his work he was but groping and feeling his way in the oems chiefly lyrical which he produced in rich images abound play of fancy and beauty of expression but there are few signs of the power of thought which he was to show in later volumes after three years thus spent by no means unfruitfully though it was only by his prize poem of imbuctoo that he won public honours he was called away from cambridge by family troubles and returned to somersby in february his father had broken down in health and a month later he died suddenly and peacefully in his armhair after the rector death an arrangement was made that the family should continue to inhabit the rectory and tennyson who was now his mother chief help and stay settled down to a studious life at home varied by occasional visits to london the habit of seclusion was already forming he was much given to solitary walking and to spending his evening in an attic reading by himself but this was not due to moroseness or selfishness as we can see from his intercourse with family and friends he would willingly give hours to reading aloud to his mother or sit listening happily while his sisters played music from this time indeed he seems to have taken his father place in the home and with hallam and other friends he continued on the same affectionate terms he had not dickens buoyant temper and love of company nor did he indulge in the splenetic outbursts of carlyle he could when it was needed find time to fulfil the humblest duties and then return with contentment to his solitude but his thoughts seemed naturally to lift him above the level of others and he was most truly himself when he was alone apart from his eyesight which began to trouble him at this time he was enjoying good health which he maintained by a steady regime of physical exercise his strength and his good looks were alike remarkable as his friend brookfield laughingly said t was not fair that he should be hercules as well as apollo another volume of verse appeared in and its appearance seems to have been due rather to the urgent persuasion of his friends than to his own eagerness to appear in print though j s mill and a few other critics wrote with good judgement and praised the book it met with a cold reception in most places and the quarterly review regardless of its blunder over keats spoke of it in most contemptuous terms all can recognize toay how unfair this was to the merits of a volume which contained the otosaters enone and the ady of shalott but the effect of the harsh verdict on the poet always sensitive about the reception of his work was unfortunate to a degree for a time it seemed likely to chill his ardour and stifle his poetic gifts at the very age when they ought to be bearing fruit he writes of himself at this time as oping like an owl in an ivy bush or as that one sparrow which the hebrew mentioneth as sitting on the houseop and despite his friendship with hallam which was closer than ever since the latter engagement to his sister emily he had thoughts of settling abroad in france or italy since he found or fancied that he found in england too unsympathetic an atmosphere note the portrait of by samuel laurence of which the original is at aldworth speaks for itself such a decision would have been disastrous residence abroad might suit the robust manyided genius of robert browning with his gift for interpreting the thoughts of other nations and other times it would have been fatal to tennyson whose affections were rooted in his native soil and who had a special call to speak to englishmen of english scenes and english life the following year brought him a still severer shock in the loss of his beloved friend arthur hallam who was taken ill at vienna and died there a few days later to the deep sorrow of all who knew him many besides tennyson have borne witness to his character and gifts thanks to their tribute and above all to the verses of in memoriam though his life was all too short to realize the promise of his youth his name will be preserved the gradual growth of tennyson elegy can be discerned from the letters of his friends to whom from time to time he read some of the stanzas which he had completed even in the first winter after hallam death he wrote a few lines in the manuscript book which he kept by him for the purpose during the next fifteen years and which he was within an ace of losing in just when the poem was completed and ready for publication as a statesman turns from his private sorrow to devote himself to a public cause so the poet instinct was to find comfort in the practice of his art under the stress of feelings aroused by this event and under the influence of a wider reading his mind was maturing we hear of a steady discipline of mental work of hours given methodically to italian and german to theology and history to chemistry botany and other branches of science above all he pondered now as he did later so constantly on the mystery of death and life after death outwardly this seems the most uneventful period of his career but in their effect on his mind and work these years were very far from being wasted when next in he emerges from seclusion to offer his verses to the public he had enlarged the range of his subjects and deepened his powers of thought we see less richness in the images less freedom in the play of fancy but there is a firmer grip of character a surer handling of the problems affecting the life of man underground was flowing the hidden stream of in memoriam unknown save to the few only in part were the fruits of this period to be seen in the two volumes containing nglish idyls and other new poems along with a selection of earlier lyrics now revised and reprinted the distinctive quality of the book is given by the word idyl which was to be so closely connected with tennyson fame here he is working in a small compass but he breaks fresh ground in describing scenes of english village life and shows that he has used his gifts of observation to good purpose better than the slight sketches of character of girls and their lovers of farmers and their children are the landscapes in which they are set and many will remember the charming passages in which he describes the morning songs of birds in a garden or the twinkling of evening lights in the still waters of a harbour more original and more full of lyrical fervour was ocksley hall where he expresses many thoughts that were stirring the younger spirits of his day perhaps the most perfect workmanship in a volume where much calls for admiration is to be found in lysses which the poet friend monckton milnes gave to sir robert peel to read in order to convince him that tennyson work merited official recognition his treatment of the hero is as far from the classical spirit as anything which william morris wrote he preserves little of the directness or fierce temper of the early epic rather does his ulysses think and speak like some bold adventurer of the renaissance with the combination of ardent curiosity and reflective thought which was the mark of that age even so tennyson himself as he passed from youth to middle life and from that to old age was ever trying to achieve one more ork of noble note and yearning to follow knowledge like a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought but between this and the production of his next volume comes the most unhappy period in the poet career when his friends for a time despaired of his future and even of his life at the marriage of his brother charles in tennyson had fallen in love with the bride sister emily sellwood and in the course of the next three or four years they became informally engaged to one another but his prospects of earning enough money to support a wife seemed so remote that in her family insisted on breaking off the engagement and the lovers ceased to write to one another even the volumes of while winning high favour with cultivated readers and stirring enthusiasm at the universities failed to attract the larger public and to make a success in the market so when he sustained a further blow in the loss of his small fortune owing to an unwise investment his health gave way and he fell into a dark mood of hypochondria his star seemed to be sinking just as he was winning his way to fame thanks to medical attention aided by his own natural strength and the affections of his friends he was already rallying in when peel conferred on him the timely honour of a pension and he was able not only to continue working at in memoriam but also to produce in the princess which gives clear evidence of renewed cheerfulness and vigour dealing as it does half humorously with the question of woman education and her claim to a higher place in the scheme of life it illustrates the interest which tennyson despite his seclusion felt in social questions of the day from this point of view it may be linked with locksley hall and maud but in the princess the treatment is half humorous and the setting is more artificial tennyson lyrical power is seen at its best in the magical songs which occur in the course of the story or interposed between the different scenes they have deservedly won a place in all anthologies his facility in the handling of blank verse is also remarkable lovers of milton may regret the massive grandeur of an earlier style but as in every art so in poetry we pay for advance in technical accomplishment in suppleness and melodious phrasing by the loss of other qualities which are difficult to recapture meanwhile in memoriam was approaching completion and this the most central and characteristic of his poems illustrates more truly than a narrative of outward events the phases through which tennyson had been passing desultory though the method of its production be and loose he texture of its fabric there is a certain sequence of thought running through the cantos we see how from the first poignancy of grief when he can only brood passively over his friend death he was led to questioning the basis of his faith shaken as it was by the claims of physical science ow from those doubts of his own he was led to think of the universal trouble of the world ow at length by throwing himself into the hopes and aspiration of humanity he attained to victory and was able to put away his personal grief believing that his friend soul was still working with him in the universe for the good of all at intervals during the three years mirrored in the poem we get definite notes of time we see how the poet is affected each year as the winter and the spring come round and how the succeeding anniversaries of hallam death stir the old pain in varying degree but we must not suppose that each section was composed at the time represented in this scheme seventeen years went to the perfecting of the work it is impossible to tell when each canto was first outlined and how often it was reritten and we must be content with general notions of its development the poet memory was fully charged as he could recall so vividly the lincolnshire landscape when he was living in the south so he could portray the emotions of the past though he had entered on a new period of life fraught with a different spirit thus many elements go to make up the whole and readers of in memoriam can choose what suits their mood to some who wish to compare the problems of different ages chief interest will attach to that section where the active mind wakes up to the conflict between science and faith it was a difficult age for poets and believers the preceding generation had for a time been swept far from their bearings by the tornado of the french revolution some of them found an early grave while still upholding the flag others had won back to harbour when their youth was past and ended their days in calm f not stagnant aters but the advance of scientific discoveries and the scientific spirit sapped the defences of faith in more methodical fashion and tennyson mind was only too open to all the evidence of natural law and the stern lessons of the struggle for life to understand the influence of tennyson on his age it is necessary to inquire how he reconciled religion with science but this is too large a subject for a biographical sketch and valuable studies have been written which deal with it more or less fully by stopford brooke and many others note tennyson by stopford brooke isbister to queen victoria and to others who had been stricken in their home affections the human interest outweighed all others the sorrow of those who gave little thought to systems of philosophy or religion was instinctively comforted by the note of faith in a future life and by the haunting melodies in which it found expression many were content to return again and again to those passages where the beauty of nature is depicted in stanzas of wonderful felicity no such gift of observation had yet ministered to their delight readers of mrs gaskell will be reminded of the old farmer in cranford revelling in the new knowledge which he has gained of the colour of ashuds in march so too we are taught to look afresh at larch woods in spring and beech woods in autumn at the cedar in the garden and the yew tree in the churchyard we are vividly conscious of the summer breeze which tumbles the pears in the orchard and the winter storm when the leafless ribs of the wood clang and gride as the perfect stanza lingers in our memory our eyes are opened and we are taught to observe the marvels of nature for ourselves here more than anywhere else is he the true successor of wordsworth the wordsworth of the daisy the daffodil and the lesser celandine though following a method of his own t once a disciple and a master but other influences than those of nature were coming into his life in the tennyson family had been compelled to leave somersby and the poet recluse though he was showed that he could rouse himself to meet a practical emergency with good sense he took charge of all arrangements and transplanted his mother successively to new homes in essex and kent this brought him nearer to london and enlarged considerably his circle of friends the list of men of letters who welcomed him there is a long one from samuel rogers to the rossettis and includes poets novelists historians scholars and scientists the most interesting to him and to us was carlyle then living at chelsea who had published his french revolution in and had thereby become notable among literary men carlyle judgements on the poet and his poems have often been quoted at first he was more than contemptuous over the latter and exhorted tennyson to leave verse and rhyme and apply himself to prose but familiar converse in which both men spoke their opinions without reserve soon enlightened he sage and he delighted in his new friend long after in he confessed that lfred always from the beginning took a grip at the right side of every question he could not fail to appreciate the man when he saw him in the flesh and it is he who has left us the most striking picture of tennyson appearance in middle life in he wrote to emerson lfred is one of the few figures who are and remain beautiful to me true human soul one of the finestooking men in the world a great shock of rough dustyark hair brightaughing hazel eyes massive aquiline face most massive yet most delicate of sallowrown complexion almost indianooking clothes cynically loose freendasy mokes infinite tobacco his voice is musical metallic it for loud laughter and piercing wail and all that may lie between speech and speculation free and plenteous i do not meet in these late decades such company over a pipe not only were pipes smoked at home but walks were taken in the london streets at night with much free converse in which art both were masters but of which carlyle no doubt had the larger share tennyson was a master of the art of silence which carlyle could praise but never practice but when he spoke his remarks rarely failed to strike the bell another comrade worthy of special notice was fitzgerald famous toay as the translator of omar khayyam and also as the man whom two great authors tennyson and thackeray named as their most cherished friend he was living a hermit life in suffolk dividing his day between his yacht his garden and his books and writing when he was in the humour those gossipy letters which have placed him as a classic with cowper and lamb from time to time he would come to london for a visit to a picture gallery or an evening with his friends and for many years he never failed to write once a year for news of the poet whose books he might criticize capriciously but whose image was always fresh in his affectionate heart of his old cambridge circle tennyson honoured above all others is domeship james spedding of the massive rounded head of the rare judgement in literature of the unselfish and faithful discharge of all the duties which he could take upon himself great as was his edition of bacon he was by the common consent of his friends far greater than anything which he achieved and his memory is most worthily preserved in the letters of tennyson and of others who knew him in london he was present at gatherings where landor and leigh hunt represented the elder generation of poets but he was more familiar with his contemporaries henry taylor and aubrey de vere it is the latter who gives us an interesting account of two meetings between wordsworth and his successor in the laureateship the occasions when tennyson and browning met one another and read their poetry aloud were also cherished in the memory of those friends who were fortunate enough to be present differing as they did in temperament and in tastes they were rivals in generosity to one another and indeed to all their brethren who wielded the pen of the writer to meet such choice spirits tennyson would leave for a while his precious solitude and his books london could not be his home but it became a place of pleasant meetings and of friendships in which he found inspiration and help note alfred lord tennyson a memoir by his son vol i p macmillan co note robert browning by edward dowden p j dent co thus it was that tennyson spent the quiet years of meditation and study before he achieved his full renown this was no such sensational event as byron meteoric appearance in but one year is a clear landmark in his career this was the date of the publication of in memoriam and of his appointment on the death of wordsworth to the office of poet laureate this year saw the end of his struggle with illortune and the end of his long courtship in june he was married at shiplake on the thames to emily sellwood henceforth his happiness was assured and he knew no more the restlessness and melancholy which had clouded his enjoyment of life his course was clear and for forty years his position was hardly questioned in all lands where the english tongue was spoken noble companies of worshippers might worthily swear allegiance to thackeray and browning but by the voice of the people dickens and tennyson were enthroned supreme to deal with all the volumes of poetry that tennyson published between and his death would be impossible within the limits of these pages in some cases he reverted to themes which he had treated before and he preserved for many years the same skill in craftsmanship but in maud in the idylls of the king and in the historical dramas unquestionably he broke new ground partly on account of the scheme of the poem partly for the views expressed on questions of the day maud provoked more hostile criticism than anything which he wrote yet it seems to have been the poet favourite work the story of its composition is curious it was suggested by a short lyric which tennyson had printed privately in beginning with the words h that were possible after long grief his friend sir john simeon urged him to write a poem which would lead up to and explain it and the poet adopting the idea used maud as a vehicle for much which he was feeling in the disillusionment of middle life the form of a monodrama was unfamiliar to the public and has difficulties of its own tennyson has combined action proceeding somewhat spasmodically with a skilful study of character showing us the exaggerated sensibility of a nature which under the successive influence of misanthropy hope love and tragic disappointment may easily pass beyond the borderand of insanity in the scene where love is triumphant tennyson touches the highest point of lyrical passion but there are jarring notes introduced in the satirical descriptions of maud brother and of the rival who aspires to her hand and in the later cantos where after the fatal quarrel the hero is driven to moody thoughts and dark presages of woe there are passages which seem to be charged with the doctrine that england was being corrupted by long peace and needed the purifying discipline of war for this the poet was taken to task by his critics and though it is unfair in dramatic work to attribute to an author the words of his characters tennyson found it difficult to clear himself of suspicion the more so that the crimean war inspired at this time some of his most popular martial ballads and songs the idylls of the king had a different fate and achieved instant popularity the first four were published in and within a few months copies were sold tennyson original design formed early in life had been to build a single epic on the arthurian theme which seemed to him to give scope like virgil aeneid for patriotic treatment he greatest of all poetical subjects he called it and it haunted his mind perpetually but if virgil found such a task difficult nineteen hundred years before it was doubly difficult for tennyson to satisfy his generation with scientific historians raking the ash heaps of the past and pedants demanding local colour in shaping his poem to meet the requirements of history he was in danger of losing that breadth of treatment which is essential for epic poetry he fell back on the device of selecting episodes each a complete picture in itself and grouping them round a single hero the story is placed in the twilight between the roman withdrawal and the conquests of the saxons when the lamp of history was glimmering most faintly in these troublous times a king is miraculously sent to be a bulwark to the people against the inroads of their foes he founds an order of knighthood bound by vows to fight for all just and noble causes and upholds for a time victoriously the standard of chivalry within his realm till through the entrance of sin and treachery the spell is broken and the heathen overrun the land after his last battle in the far west of our island the king passes away to the supernatural world from which he came this last episode had been handled many years before and the orte drthur which had appeared in the volume of was incorporated into the assing of arthur to close the series of idylls with what admixture of allegory this story was set out it is hard to say ennyson himself could not in later years be induced to define his purpose ut it seems certain that many of the characters are intended to symbolize higher and lower qualities according to some interpretations king arthur stands for the power of conscience and queen guinevere for the heart galahad represents purity bors rough honesty percivale humility and merlin the power of the intellect which is too easily beguiled by treachery so the whole story is moralized by the entrance through guinevere and lancelot of sin by the gradual fading through the lightness of one or the treachery of another of the brightness of chivalry and by the final ruin which shatters the fair ideal but there is no need to darken counsel by questions about history or allegory if we wish first and last to enjoy poetry for its own sake here as in spenser faerie queene forth go noble knights with gentle maidens through the enchanted scenes of fairyland for their order and its vows they are ready to dare all lawlessness is tamed and cruelty is punished and no perilous quest presents itself but there is a champion ready to follow it to the end and if severe critics tell us that they find no true gift of storyelling here let us go for a verdict to the young they may not be good judges of style or safe interpreters of shades of thought but they know when a story carries them away and the idylls of the king like the waverley novels have captured the heart of many a lover of literature who has not yet learnt to question his instinct or to weigh his treasures in the scales of criticism and older readers may find themselves kindled to enthusiasm by reflective passages rich in high aspiration or charmed by descriptions of nature as beautiful as anything which tennyson wrote in the historical plays which occupied a large part of his attention between and tennyson undertook a yet harder task he chose periods when national issues of high importance were at stake such as the conflict between the church and the crown between the domination of the priest and the claim of the individual to freedom of belief he put aside all exuberance of fancy and diction as unsuited to tragedy he handled his theme with dignity and at times with force and attained a literary success to which browning and other good judges bore testimony of becket in particular he made a sympathetic figure which in the skilful hands of henry irving won considerable favour upon the stage but the times were out of joint for the poetic drama and he had not the rich imagination of shakespeare nor the power to create living men and women who compel our hearts to pity to horror or to delight for the absence of this no studious reading of history no fine sentiment no noble cadences can make amends and it seems doubtful whether future ages will regard the plays as anything but a literary curiosity on the other hand nothing which he wrote has touched the human heart more genuinely than the poems of peasant life some of them written in the broadest lincolnshire dialect which tennyson produced during the years in which he was engaged on the idylls and the plays he grandmother he northern cobbler and the two poems on the lincolnshire farmers of following generations were as popular as anything which the victorian age produced and seem likely to keep their preminence the two latter illustrate by their origin tennyson power of seizing on a single impression and building on it a work of creative genius it was enough for him to hear the anecdote of the dying farmer words od aighty little knows what he about in taking me and squire will be mad and he conceived the character of the man and his absorption in the farm where he had lived and worked and around which he grouped his conceptions of religion and duty the later type of farmer was evoked similarly by a quotation in the dialect of his county hen i canters my herse along the ramper i ars proputty proputty proputty and again tennyson achieved a triumph of characterization it is here perhaps that he comes nearest to the achievements of his great rival browning in the field of dramatic lyrics apart from the writing and publication of his poems we cannot divide tennyson later life into definite sections by his habits had been formed his friendships established his fame assured such landmarks as are furnished by the birth of his children by his journeyings abroad by the homes in which he settled point to no essential change in the current of his life of the perfect happiness which marriage brought to him of the charm and dignity which enabled mrs tennyson to hold her place worthily at his side many witnesses have spoken two sons were born to him one of whom died in while the other named after his lost friend lived to write the memoir which will always be the chief authority for our knowledge of the man his homes soon became household words o great was the spell which tennyson cast over the hearts of his readers farringford at the western end of the isle of wight was first tenanted by him in and was bought in here the poet enjoyed perfect quiet a genial climate and the proximity of the sea for which his love never failed it was a very different coast to the bleak sandhills and wide flats of mablethorpe above freshwater the noble line of the downs rises and falls as it runs westward to the needles where it plunges abruptly into the sea and here on the springy turf a tall romantic figure in widerimmed hat and flowing cloak the poet would often walk but farringford lying low in the shelter of the hills proved too hot in summer freshwater was discovered by tourists too often inquisitive about the great and so after ten or twelve years he was searching for another home some remoter fastness set on higher ground this he discovered on the borders of surrey and sussex near haslemere where black down rises to a height of feet above the sea and commands a wide prospect over the blue expanse of the weald here he found copses and commons haunted by the song of birds here he raised plantations close at hand to shelter him from the rude northern winds and here he built the stately house of aldworth where some thirty years later he was to die to both houses came frequent guests for shy as he was of paying visits he loved to see in his own house men and women who could talk to him as equals or was he always averse to those of reverent temper so they were careful not to jar on his fastidious tastes in some ways it was a pity that he did not come to closer quarters with the rougher forces that were fermenting in the industrial districts it might have helped him to a better understanding of the classes that were pushing to the front who were to influence so profoundly the england of the morrow but the strain of kindly sympathy in tennyson nature can be seen at its best in his intercourse with cottagers sailors and other humble folk who lived near his doors the stories which his son tells us show how the poet was able to obtain an insight into their minds and to write poems like he grandmother with artistic truth and no visitor received a heartier welcome at farringford than garibaldi who was at once peasant and sailor and who remained so none the less when he had become a hero of european fame to englishmen of nearly every cultured profession tennyson hospitality was freely extended e need only instance professor tyndall dean bradley james anthony froude aubrey de vere g f watts henry irving hubert parry lord dufferin and that most constant of friends benjamin jowett preminent among the oxford celebrities of the day among his immediate neighbours he conceived a peculiar affection for sir john simeon whose death in called forth the stanzas n the garden at swainston and no one was more at home at farringford than julia cameron famous among early photographers who has left us some of the best likenesses of the poet in middle and later life tennyson was not familiar with foreign countries to the same degree as browning nor was he ever a great traveller when he went abroad he needed the help of some loyal friend like francis palgrave or frederick locker to safeguard him against pitfalls and to shield him from annoyance when he was too old to stand the fatigue of railway journeys he was willing to be taken for a cruise on a friend yacht and thus he visited many parts of scotland and the harbours of scandinavia amid new surroundings he was not always easy to please bad food or smelly streets would call forth loud protests and upset him for a day but his friends found it worth their while to risk some anxiety in order to enjoy his keen observation and the originality of his talk wherever he went he took with him his stored wisdom on homer dante and the i maiores of literature and when gladstone too happened to be one of the party on board ship the talk must have been well worth hearing as in his youth so now tennyson mind moved most naturally on a lofty plane and he was most at home with the great poets of the past and with the exception of a few poems like along the valley where the torrents at cauteretz reminded him of an early visit with hallam to the pyrenees we can trace little evidence in his poetry of the journeys which he made but we can see from his letters that he was kindled by the beauty of italian cities and their treasures in every pictureallery which he visited he showed his preference for titian and the rich colour of the venetian painters he refused to be bound by the conventional english taste for alpine scenery and broke out into abuse of the discoloured water in the grindelwald glacier filthy thing and looking as if a thousand london seasons had passed over it in all places among all people he said what he thought and felt with independence and conviction one incident connecting him with italy is worthy of mention as showing that the poet who rom out the northern island came at times to visit them was known and esteemed by the people of italy when the mantuans celebrated in the nineteenth centenary of the death of virgil the classic poet to whom tennyson owed most they asked him to write an ode and nobly he rose to the occasion attaining a felicity of phrase which is hardly excelled in the choicest lines of virgil himself but it is as the laureate of his own country that he is of primary interest and it is time to inquire how he fulfilled the functions of his office and how he rendered that office of value to the state when he was first appointed queen victoria had let him know that he was to be excused from the obligation of writing complimentary verse to celebrate the doings of the court of his own accord he composed occasional odes for the marriages of her sons and showed some of his practised skill in dignifying such themes but it is not here that he found his work as laureate he achieved greater success in the poems which he wrote to honour the exploits of our army and navy in the past or the present in his ballad of he revenge in his balaclava poems in the iege of lucknow he struck a heroic note which found a ready echo in the hearts of soldiers and sailors and those who love the services above all in the great ode on the death of the duke of wellington he has stirred all the chords of national feeling as no other laureate before him and has enriched our literature with a jewel which is beyond price the arthurian epic failed to achieve its national aim and the historical dramas though inspired by great principles which have helped to shape our history never touched those large circles to which as laureate he should appeal some might judge that his function was best fulfilled in the lyrics to be found scattered throughout his work which praise the slow ordered progress of english liberties passages from maud or in memoriam will occur to many readers still more the three lyrics generally printed together at the end of the poems beginning with the wellnown tines f old sat freedom on the heights ove thou thy land and ou ask me why though ill at ease here we listen to the voice of english liberalism uttered in very different tones from those of byron and shelley expressing the mind of one who recoiled from french revolutions and had little sympathy with their aims of universal equality in this he represented very truly that victorian movement which was guided by cobden and mill by peel and gladstone which conferred such practical benefits upon the england of their day but it is hardly the temper that we expect of an ardent poet at any rate in the days of his youth the burning passion of carlyle ruskin or william morris however tempered by other feelings called forth a heartier response in the breast of the toiling multitudes it may be that the claim of tennyson to popular sovereignty will in the end rest chiefly on the pleasure which he gave to many thousands of his fellowountrymen a pleasure to be renewed and found again in english scenes and in thoughts which coloured grey lives and warmed cold hearts which shed the ray of faith on those who could accept no creeds and who yet yearned for some hope of an afterife to cheer their declining days that he gave

figure as charles kingsley in his eversley home his father was of an old squire family like his son he was a clergyman a naturalist and a sportsman his mother a miss lucas came from barbados and while she wrote poetry with feeling and skill she had also a practical gift of management his father calling involved several changes of residence those which had most influence on his son were his removal in to barnack on the edge of the fens still untamed and full of wild life and in to clovelly in north devon more than thirty years later when asked to fill up the usual questions in a lady album he wrote that his favourite scenery was ide flats and open sea he was precocious as a child and perpetrated poems and sermons at the age of four but very early he developed a habit of observation and a healthy interest in things outside himself such a nature could not be indifferent to the beauty of clovelly to the coming and going of its fishermen and to the romance and danger of their lives the steep villagetreet nestling among the woods the little harbour sheltered by the sandstone cliffs the wide view over the blue water won his lifelong affection his parents talked of sending him to eton or rugby but in the end they decided to put him with derwent coleridge the poet son at the grammar school of helston here he had the scenery which he loved and masters who developed his strong bent towards natural science and here he laid the foundations of his knowledge of botany which remained all his life his favourite recreation he was an eager reader but not a close student of books fond of outdoor life but not skilled in athletic games capable of much effort and much endurance but rather irregular in his spurts of energy a more methodical training might have saved him some mistakes but it might also have taken the edge off that fresh enthusiasm which made intercourse with him at all times seem like a breath of moorland air here he developed an independence of mind and a fearlessness of opinion which is rarely to be found in the atmosphere of a big public school at the age of seventeen when his father was appointed to st luke chelsea he left helston and spent two years attending lectures at king college london and preparing for cambridge these were by no means among his happier years he disliked london and he rebelled against the dullness of life in a vicarage overrun with district visitors and mothers meetings his father a strong evangelical objected to various forms of public amusement and charles though loyal and affectionate to his parents fretted to find no outlet for his energies he made a few friends and devoured many books but his chief delight was to get away from town to old westountry haunts nor was his life at cambridge entirely happy his excitability was great his selfontrol was not yet developed rowing did not exhaust his physical energy which broke out from time to time in midnight fishing raids and walks from cambridge to london he wasted so much of his time that he nearly imperilled his chance of taking a good degree and might perhaps count himself lucky when thanks to a heroic effort at the eleventh hour his excellent abilities won him a first class in classics at this time he was terribly shaken by religious doubts but in one of his vacations in he met fanny grenfell his future wife and soon he was on such a footing that he could open to her his inmost thoughts it was she who helped him in his wavering decision to take holy orders and when he went down in he set himself to read seriously and thoroughly for ordination early in he was admitted to deacon orders at farnham his first office marked out his path through life with a short interval between his holding the curacy and the rectory of eversley he had his home for thirtyhree years at this hampshire village so intimately connected with his name eversley lies on the borders of berkshire and hampshire in the diocese of winchester near the famous house of bramshill

winter garden there he served for a year as curate living in bachelor quarters on the green learning to love the place and its people there when sir john cope offered him the living in he returned a married man to live in the rectory house beside the church which may still be seen little altered toay a breakdown from overwork an illness of his wife a higher appointment in the church might be the cause of his passing a few weeks or even months away but year in year out he gave of his very best to eversley for thirtyhree years and to it he returned from his journeys with all the more ardour to resume his work among his own people the church was dilapidated the rectory was badly drained the parish had been neglected by an absentee rector for long periods together kingsley was too poor to afford a curate when he had one the luxury was paid for by extra labour in taking private pupils he had disappointments and anxieties but his courage never faltered he concentrated his energies on steady progress in things material and moral and whatever his hand found to do he did it with his might note for a few weeks in he was curate of pimperne in dorset the church and its services called for instant attention the holy communion had been celebrated only three times a year the other services were few and irregular on sundays the church was empty and the alehouse was full the building was badly kept the churchyard let out for grazing the whole place destitute of reverence what the service came to be under the new rector we can read on the testimony of many visitors the intensity of his devotion at all times the inspiration which the great festivals of the church particularly roused in him changed all this rapidly he did all he could to draw his parishioners to church but he had no rigid puritanical views about the sabbath a staffollege officer who frequently visited him on sundays tells us of he genial happy unreserved intercourse of those sunday afternoons spent at the rectory and how the villagers were free to play their cricket paason he dont objec ot s loik as not come and look on all his life he supported the movement for opening museums to the public on sundays and this at a time when few of the clergy were bold enough to speak on his side the church was not his only organ for teaching he started schools and informal classes in winter he would sometimes give up his leisure to such work every evening of the week the rectory for all its books and bottles its fishingods and curious specimens was not a mere refuge for his own work and his own hobbies but a centre of light and warmth where all his parishioners might come and find a welcome he was one of the first to start enny readings in his parish to lighten the monotony of winter evenings with music poetry stories and lectures and though his parish was so wide and scattered he tried to rally support for a village readingoom and kept it alive for some years his afternoons were regularly given to parish visiting except when there were other definite calls upon his time he soon came to know every man woman and child in his parish his sympathies were so wide that he could make himself at home with every one with none more so than the gipsies and poachers who shared his intimate knowledge of the neighbouring heaths and of the practices lawful and unlawful by which they could be made to supply food he would listen to their stories sympathize with their troubles and speak frankly in return there was no condescension one of his pupils speaks of he simple delicate deep respect for the poor which could be seen in his manner and his talk among the cottagers he could be severe enough when severity was needed as when he compelled a cruel farmer to kill miserable horse which was rotting alive in front of his house and he could deal no less drastically with hypocrisy when a professional beggar fell on his knees at the rectory gate and pretended to pray he was at once ejected by the rector with every mark of indignation and contumely but the weak and suffering always made a special appeal to him though it was easy to vex and exasperate him he could always put away his own troubles in presence of his own children or of any who needed his help he had that intense power of sympathy which enabled him to understand and reach the heart
