among the writers of the concluding part of the last century there is none more deserving of our notice than friedrich schiller distinguished alike for the splendour of his intellectual faculties and the elevation of his tastes and feelings he has left behind him in his works a noble emblem of these great qualities and the reputation which he thus enjoys and has merited excites our attention the more on considering the circumstances under which it was acquired schiller had peculiar difficulties to strive with and his success has likewise been peculiar much of his life was deformed by inquietude and disease and it terminated at middle age he composed in a language then scarcely settled into form or admitted to a rank among the cultivated languages of europe yet his writings are remarkable for their extent and variety as well as their intrinsic excellence and his own countrymen are not his only or perhaps his principal admirers it is difficult to collect or interpret the general voice but the world no less than germany seems already to have dignified him with the reputation of a classic to have enrolled him among that select number whose works belong not wholly to any age or nation but who having instructed their own contemporaries are claimed as instructors by the great family of mankind and set apart for many centuries from the common oblivion which soon overtakes the mass of authors as it does the mass of other men such has been the high destiny of schiller his history and character deserve our study for more than one reason a natural and harmless feeling attracts us towards such a subject we are anxious to know how so great a man passed through the world how he lived and moved and had his being and the question if properly investigated might yield advantage as well as pleasure it would be interesting to discover by what gifts and what employment of them he reached the eminence on which we now see him to follow the steps of his intellectual and moral culture to gather from his life and works some picture of himself it is worth inquiring whether he who could represent noble actions so well did himself act nobly how those powers of intellect which in philosophy and art achieved so much applied themselves to the everyay emergencies of life how the generous ardour which delights us in his poetry displayed itself in the common intercourse between man and man it would at once instruct and gratify us if we could understand him thoroughly could transport ourselves into his circumstances outward and inward could see as he saw and feel as he felt but if the various utility of such a task is palpable enough its difficulties are not less so we should not lightly think of comprehending the very simplest character in all its bearings and it might argue vanity to boast of even a common acquaintance with one like schiller such men as he are misunderstood by their daily companions much more by the distant observer who gleans his information from scanty records and casual notices of characteristic events which biographers are often too indolent or injudicious to collect and which the peaceful life of a man of letters usually supplies in little abundance the published details of schiller history are meagre and insufficient and his writings like those of every author can afford but a dim and dubious copy of his mind nor is it easy to decipher even this with moderate accuracy the haze of a foreign language of foreign manners and modes of thinking strange to us confuses and obscures the sight often magnifying what is trivial softening what is rude and sometimes hiding or distorting what is beautiful to take the dimensions of schiller mind were a hard enterprise in any case harder still with these impediments accordingly we do not in this place pretend to attempt it we have no finished portrait of his character to offer no formal estimate of his works it will be enough for us if in glancing over his life we can satisfy a simple curiosity about the fortunes and chief peculiarities of a man connected with us by a bond so kindly as that of the teacher to the taught the giver to the receiver of mental delight if in wandering through his intellectual creation we can enjoy once more the magnificent and fragrant beauty of that fairy land and express our feelings where we do not aim at judging and deciding johann christoph friedrich schiller was a native of marbach a small town of w rtemberg situated on the banks of the neckar he was born on the th of november a few months later than our own robert burns schiller early culture was favoured by the dispositions but obstructed by the outward circumstances of his parents though removed above the pressure of poverty their station was dependent and fluctuating it involved a frequent change of place and plan johann caspar schiller the father had been a surgeon in the bavarian army he served in the netherlands during the succession war after his return home to w rtemberg he laid aside the medical profession having obtained a commission of ensign and adjutant under his native prince this post he held successively in two regiments he had changed into the second and was absent on active duty when friedrich was born the peace of paris put an end to his military employment but caspar had shown himself an intelligent unassuming and useful man and the duke of w rtemberg was willing to retain him in his service the layingut of various nurseries and plantations in the pleasurerounds of ludwigsburg and solitude was intrusted to the retired soldier now advanced to the rank of captain he removed from one establishment to another from time to time and continued in the duke pay till death in his latter years he resided chiefly at ludwigsburg this mode of life was not the most propitious for educating such a boy as friedrich but the native worth of his parents did more than compensate for the disadvantages of their worldly condition and their limited acquirements in knowledge the benevolence the modest and prudent integrity the true devoutness of these good people shone forth at an after period expanded and beautified in the character of their son his heart was nourished by a constant exposure to such influences and thus the better part of his education prospered well the mother was a woman of many household virtues to a warm affection for her children and husband she joined a degree of taste and intelligence which is of much rarer occurrence she is said to have been a lover of poetry in particular an admiring reader of utz and gellert writers whom it is creditable for one in her situation to have relished her kindness and tenderness of heart peculiarly endeared her to friedrich her husband appears to have been a person of great probity and meekness of temper sincerely desirous to approve himself a useful member of society and to do his duty conscientiously to all men the seeds of many valuable qualities had been sown in him by nature and though his early life had been unfavourable for their cultivation he at a late period laboured not without success to remedy this disadvantage such branches of science and philosophy as lay within his reach he studied with diligence whenever his professional employments left him leisure on a subject connected with the latter he became an author but what chiefly distinguished him was the practice of a sincere piety which seems to have diffused itself over all his feelings and given to his clear and honest character that calm elevation which in such a case is its natural result as his religion mingled itself with every motive and action of his life the wish which in all his wanderings lay nearest his heart the wish for the education of his son was likely to be deeply tinctured with it there is yet preserved in his handwriting a prayer composed in advanced age wherein he mentions how at the child birth he had entreated the great father of all to supply in strength of spirit what must needs be wanting in outward instruction the grayaired man who had lived to see the maturity of his boy could now express his solemn thankfulness that god had heard the prayer of a mortal footnote she was of humble descent and little education the daughter of a baker in kodweis footnote his book is entitled die baumzucht im grossen the cultivation of trees on the grand scal it came to a second edition in friedrich followed the movements of his parents for some time and had to gather the elements of learning from various masters perhaps it was in part owing to this circumstance that his progress though respectable or more was so little commensurate with what he afterwards became or with the capacities of which even his earliest years gave symptoms thoughtless and gay as a boy is wont to be he would now and then dissipate his time in childish sports forgetful that the stolen charms of ball and leapfrog must be dearly bought by reproaches but occasionally he was overtaken with feelings of deeper import and used to express the agitations of his little mind in words and actions which were first rightly interpreted when they were called to mind long afterwards his schoolfellows can now recollect that even his freaks had sometimes a poetic character that a certain earnestness of temper a frank integrity an appetite for things grand or moving was discernible across all the caprices of his boyhood once it is said during a tremendous thunderstorm his father missed him in the young group within doors none of the sisters could tell what was become of fritz and the old man grew at length so anxious that he was forced to go out in quest of him fritz was scarcely past the age of infancy and knew not the dangers of a scene so awful his father found him at last in a solitary place of the neighbourhood perched on the branch of a tree gazing at the tempestuous face of the sky and watching the flashes as in succession they spread their lurid gleam over it to the reprimands of his parent the whimpering truant pleaded in extenuation that the lightning was very beautiful and that he wished to see where it was coming from such anecdotes we have long known are in themselves of small value the present one has the additional defect of being somewhat dubious in respect of authenticity we have ventured to give it as it came to us notwithstanding the picture of the boy schiller contemplating the thunder is not without a certain interest for such as know the man schiller first teacher was moser pastor and schoolmaster in the village of lorch where the parents resided from the sixth to the ninth year of their son this person deserves mention for the influence he exerted on the early history of his pupil he seems to have given his name to the priest oser in the robbers his spiritual calling and the conversation of his son himself afterwards a preacher are supposed to have suggested to schiller the idea of consecrating himself to the clerical profession this idea which laid hold of and cherished some predominant though vague propensities of the boy disposition suited well with the religious sentiments of his parents and was soon formed into a settled purpose in the public school at ludwigsburg whither the family had now removed his studies were regulated with this view and he underwent in four successive years the annual examination before the stuttgard commission to which young men destined for the church are subjected in that country schiller temper was naturally devout with a delicacy of feeling which tended towards bashfulness and timidity there was mingled in him a fervid impetuosity which was ever struggling through its concealment and indicating that he felt deeply and strongly as well as delicately such a turn of mind easily took the form of religion prescribed to it by early example and early affections as well as nature schiller looked forward to the sacred profession with alacrity it was the serious daydream of all his boyhood and much of his youth as yet however the project hovered before him at a great distance and the path to its fulfilment offered him but little entertainment his studies did not seize his attention firmly he followed them from a sense of duty not of pleasure virgil and horace he learned to construe accurately but is said to have taken no deep interest in their poetry the tenderness and meek beauty of the first the humour and sagacity and capricious pathos of the last the matchless elegance of both would of course escape his inexperienced perception while the matter of their writings must have appeared frigid and shallow to a mind so susceptible he loved rather to meditate on the splendour of the ludwigsburg theatre which had inflamed his imagination when he first saw it in his ninth year and given shape and materials to many of his subsequent reveries under these circumstances his progress with all his natural ability could not be very striking the teachers did not fail now and then to visit him with their severities yet still there was a negligent success in his attempts which joined to his honest and vivid temper made men augur well of him the stuttgard examinators have marked him in their records with the customary formula of approval or at worst of toleration they usually designate him as boy of good hope puer bon spei footnote the first display of his poetic gifts occurred also in his ninth year but took its rise in a much humbler and less common source than the inspiration of the stage his biographers have recorded this small event with a conscientious accuracy second only to that of boswell and hawkins in regard to the lichfield duck he little tale says one of them s worth relating the rather that after an interval of more than twenty years schiller himself on meeting with his early comrade the late dr elwert of kantstad for the first time since their boyhood reminded him of the adventure recounting the circumstances with great minuteness and glee it is as follows once in elwert and he had to repeat their catechism together on a certain day publicly in the church their teacher an illonditioned narrowinded pietist had previously threatened them with a thorough flogging if they missed even a single word to make the matter worse this very teacher chanced to be the person whose turn it was to catechise on the appointed day both the boys began their answers with dismayed hearts and faltering tongues yet they succeeded in accomplishing the task and were in consequence rewarded by the mollified pedagogue with two kreutzers apiece four kreutzers of ready cash was a sum of no common magnitude how it should be disposed of formed a serious question for the parties interested schiller moved that they should go to harteneck a hamlet in the neighbourhood and have a dish of curdsndream his partner assented but alas in harteneck no particle of curds or cream was to be had schiller then made offer for a quarterake of cheese but for this four entire kreutzers were demanded leaving nothing whatever in reserve for bread twice baffled the little gastronomes unsatisfied in stomach wandered on to neckarweihingen where at length though not till after much inquiry they did obtain a comfortable mess of curdsndream served up in a gay platter and silver spoons to eat it with for all this moreover they were charged but three kreutzers so that there was still one left to provide them with a bunch of st john grapes exhilarated by such liberal cheer schiller rose into a glow of inspiration having left the village he mounted with his comrade to the adjacent height which overlooks both harteneck and neckarweihingen and there in a truly poetic effusion he pronounced his malediction on the creamless region bestowing with the same solemnity his blessing on the one which had afforded him that savoury refreshment friedrich von schillers leben heidelberg p this good hope was not however destined to be realised in the way they expected accidents occurred which changed the direction of schiller exertions and threatened for a time to prevent the success of them altogether the duke of w rtemberg had lately founded a free seminary for certain branches of professional education it was first set up at solitude one of his country residences and had now been transferred to stuttgard where under an improved form and with the name of karlschule we believe it still exists the duke proposed to give the sons of his military officers a preferable claim to the benefits of this institution and having formed a good opinion both of schiller and his father he invited the former to profit by this opportunity the offer occasioned great embarrassment the young man and his parents were alike determined in favour of the church a project with which this new one was inconsistent their embarrassment was but increased when the duke on learning the nature of their scruples desired them to think well before they decided it was out of fear and with reluctance that his proposal was accepted schiller enrolled himself in and turned with a heavy heart from freedom and cherished hopes to greek and seclusion and law his anticipations proved to be but too just the six years which he spent in this establishment were the most harassing and comfortless of his life the stuttgard system of education seems to have been formed on the principle not of cherishing and correcting nature but of rooting it out and supplying its place with something better the process of teaching and living was conducted with the stiff formality of military drilling every thing went on by statute and ordinance there was no scope for the exercise of freeill no allowance for the varieties of original structure a scholar might possess what instincts or capacities he pleased the egulations of the school took no account of this he must fit himself into the common mould which like the old giant bed stood there appointed by superior authority to be filled alike by the great and the little the same strict and narrow course of reading and composition was marked out for each beforehand and it was by stealth if he read or wrote any thing beside their domestic economy was regulated in the same spirit as their preceptorial it consisted of the same sedulous exclusion of all that could border on pleasure or give any exercise to choice the pupils were kept apart from the conversation or sight of any person but their teachers none ever got beyond the precincts of despotism to snatch even a fearful joy their very amusements proceeded by the word of command how grievous all this must have been it is easy to conceive to schiller it was more grievous than to any other of an ardent and impetuous yet delicate nature whilst his discontentment devoured him internally he was too modest and timid to give it the relief of utterance by deeds or words locked up within himself he suffered deeply but without complaining some of his letters written during this period have been preserved they exhibit the ineffectual struggles of a fervid and busy mind veiling its many chagrins under a certain dreary patience which only shows them more painfully he pored over his lexicons and grammars and insipid tasks with an artificial composure but his spirit pined within him like a captive when he looked forth into the cheerful world or recollected the affection of parents the hopes and frolicsome enjoyments of past years the misery he endured in this severe and lonely mode of existence strengthened or produced in him a habit of constraint and shyness which clung to his character through life the study of law for which he had never felt any predilection naturally grew in his mind to be the representative of all these evils and his distaste for it went on increasing on this point he made no secret of his feelings one of the exercises yearly prescribed to every scholar was a written delineation of his own character according to his own views of it to be delivered publicly at an appointed time schiller on the first of these exhibitions ventured to state his persuasion that he was not made to be a jurist but called rather by his inclinations and faculties to the clerical profession this statement of course produced no effect he was forced to continue the accustomed course and his dislike for law kept fast approaching to absolute disgust in he was fortunate enough to get it relinquished though at the expense of adopting another employment for which in different circumstances he would hardly have declared himself the study of medicine for which a new institution was about this time added to the stuttgard school had no attractions for schiller he accepted it only as a galling servitude in exchange for one more galling his mind was bent on higher objects and he still felt all his present vexations aggravated by the thought that his fairest expectations from the future had been sacrificed to worldly convenience and the humblest necessities of life meanwhile the youth was waxing into manhood and the fetters of discipline lay heavier on him as his powers grew stronger and his eyes became open to the stirring and variegated interests of the world now unfolding itself to him under new and more glowing colours as yet he contemplated the scene only from afar and it seemed but the more gorgeous on that account he longed to mingle in its busy current and delighted to view the image of its movements in his favourite poets and historians plutarch and shakspeare the writings of klopstock lessing garve herder gerstenberg goethe and a multitude of others which marked the dawning literature of germany he had studied with a secret avidity they gave him vague ideas of men and life or awakened in him splendid visions of literary glory klopstock messias combined with his own religious tendencies had early turned him to sacred poetry before the end of his fourteenth year he had finished what he called an pic poem entitled moses the extraordinary popularity of gerstenberg ugolino and goethe g tz von berlichingen next directed his attention to the drama and as admiration in a mind like his full of blind activity and nameless aspirings naturally issues in imitation he plunged with equal ardour into this new subject and produced his first tragedy cosmo von medicis some fragments of which he retained and inserted in his robbers a mass of minor performances preserved among his papers or published in the magazines of the time serve sufficiently to show that his mind had already dimly discovered its destination and was striving with a restless vehemence to reach it in spite of every obstacle footnote the feeling produced in him by shakspeare he described long afterwards it throws light on the general state of his temper and tastes hen i first at a very early age he says ecame acquainted with this poet i felt indignant at his coldness his hardness of heart which permitted him in the most melting pathos to utter jests to mar by the introduction of a fool the soulearching scenes of hamlet lear and other pieces which now kept him still where my sensibilities hastened forward now drove him carelessly onward where i would so gladly have lingered he was the object of my reverence and zealous study for years before i could love himself i was not yet capable of comprehending nature at firstand i had but learned to admire her image reflected in the understanding and put in order by rules werke bd p such obstacles were in his case neither few nor small schiller felt the mortifying truth that to arrive at the ideal world he must first gain a footing in the real that he might entertain high thoughts and longings might reverence the beauties of nature and grandeur of mind but was born to toil for his daily bread poetry he loved with the passionateness of a first affection but he could not live by it he honoured it too highly to wish to live by it his prudence told him that he must yield to stern necessity must orsake the balmy climate of pindus for the greenland of a barren and dreary science of terms and he did not hesitate to obey his professional studies were followed with a rigid though reluctant fidelity it was only in leisure gained by superior diligence that he could yield himself to more favourite pursuits genius was to serve as the ornament of his inferior qualities not as an excuse for the want of them but if when such sacrifices were required it was painful to comply with the dictates of his own reason it was still more so to endure the harsh and superfluous restrictions of his teachers he felt it hard enough to be driven from the enchantments of poetry by the dull realities of duty but it was intolerable and degrading to be hemmedn still farther by the caprices of severe and formal pedagogues schiller brooded gloomily over the constraints and hardships of his situation many plans he formed for deliverance sometimes he would escape in secret to catch a glimpse of the free and busy world to him forbidden sometimes he laid schemes for utterly abandoning a place which he abhorred and trusting to fortune for the rest often the sight of his classooks and schoolpparatus became irksome beyond endurance he would feign sickness that he might be left in his own chamber to write poetry and pursue his darling studies without hindrance such artifices did not long avail him the masters noticed the regularity of his sickness and sent him tasks to be done while it lasted even schiller patience could not brook this his natural timidity gave place to indignation he threw the paper of exercises at the feet of the messenger and said sternly that here he would choose his own studies under such corroding and continual vexations an ordinary spirit would have sunk at length would have gradually given up its loftier aspirations and sought refuge in vicious indulgence or at best have sullenly harnessed itself into the yoke and plodded through existence weary discontented and broken ever casting back a hankering look upon the dreams of youth and ever without power to realise them but schiller was no ordinary character and did not act like one beneath a cold and simple exterior dignified with no artificial attractions and marred in its native amiableness by the incessant obstruction the isolation and painful destitutions under which he lived there was concealed a burning energy of soul which no obstruction could extinguish the hard circumstances of his fortune had prevented the natural development of his mind his faculties had been cramped and misdirected but they had gathered strength by opposition and the habit of selfependence which it encouraged his thoughts unguided by a teacher had sounded into the depths of his own nature and the mysteries of his own fate his feelings and passions unshared by any other heart had been driven back upon his own where like the volcanic fire that smoulders and fuses in secret they accumulated till their force grew irresistible hitherto schiller had passed for an unprofitable a discontented and a disobedient boy but the time was now come when the gyves of schooliscipline could no longer cripple and distort the giant might of his nature he stood forth as a man and wrenched asunder his fetters with a force that was felt at the extremities of europe the publication of the robbers forms an era not only in schiller history but in the literature of the world and there seems no doubt that but for so mean a cause as the perverted discipline of the stuttgard school we had never seen this tragedy schiller commenced it in his nineteenth year and the circumstances under which it was composed are to be traced in all its parts it is the production of a strong untutored spirit consumed by an activity for which there is no outlet indignant at the barriers which restrain it and grappling darkly with the phantoms to which its own energy thus painfully imprisoned gives being a rude simplicity combined with a gloomy and overpowering force are its chief characteristics they remind us of the defective cultivation as well as of the fervid and harassed feelings of its author above all the latter quality is visible the tragic interest of the robbers is deep throughout so deep that frequently it borders upon horror a grim inexpiable fate is made the ruling principle it envelops and overshadows the whole and under its louring influence the fiercest efforts of human will appear but like flashes that illuminate the wild scene with a brief and terrible splendour and are lost forever in the darkness the unsearchable abysses of man destiny are laid open before us black and profound and appalling as they seem to the young mind when it first attempts to explore them the obstacles that thwart our faculties and wishes the deceitfulness of hope the nothingness of existence are sketched in the sable colours so natural to the enthusiast when he first ventures upon life and compares the world that is without him to the anticipations that were within karl von moor is a character such as young poets always delight to contemplate or delineate to schiller the analogy of their situations must have peculiarly recommended him moor is animated into action by feelings similar to those under which his author was then suffering and longing to act gifted with every noble quality of manhood in overflowing abundance moor first expectations of life and of the part he was to play in it had been glorious as a poet dream but the minor dexterities of management were not among his endowments in his eagerness to reach the goal he had forgotten that the course is a labyrinthic maze beset with difficulties of which some may be surmounted some can only be evaded many can be neither hurried on by the headlong impetuosity of his temper he entangles himself in these perplexities and thinks to penetrate them not by skill and patience but by open force he is baffled deceived and still more deeply involved but injury and disappointment exasperate rather than instruct him he had expected heroes and he finds mean men friends and he finds smiling traitors to tempt him aside to profit by his aberrations and lead him onward to destruction he had dreamed of magnanimity and every generous principle he finds that prudence is the only virtue sure of its reward too fiery by nature the intensity of his sufferings has now maddened him still farther he is himself incapable of calm reflection and there is no counsellor at hand to assist him none whose sympathy might assuage his miseries whose wisdom might teach him to remedy or to endure them he is stung by fury into action and his activity is at once blind and tremendous since the world is not the abode of unmixed integrity he looks upon it as a den of thieves since its institutions may obstruct the advancement of worth and screen delinquency from punishment he regards the social union as a pestilent nuisance the mischiefs of which it is fitting that he in his degree should do his best to repair by means however violent revenge is the mainspring of his conduct but he ennobles it in his own eyes by giving it the colour of a disinterested concern for the maintenance of justice the abasement of vice from its high places and the exaltation of suffering virtue single against the universe to appeal to the primary law of the stronger to rasp the scales of providence in a mortal hand is frantic and wicked but moor has a force of soul which makes it likewise awful the interest lies in the conflict of this gigantic soul against the fearful odds which at length overwhelm it and hurry it down to the darkest depths of ruin the original conception of such a work as this betrays the inexperience no less than the vigour of youth its execution gives a similar testimony the characters of the piece though traced in glowing colours are outlines more than pictures the few features we discover in them are drawn with elaborate minuteness but the rest are wanting every thing indicates the condition of a keen and powerful intellect which had studied men in books only had by selfxamination and the perusal of history detected and strongly seized some of the leading peculiarities of human nature but was yet ignorant of all the minute and more complex principles which regulate men conduct in actual life and which only a knowledge of living men can unfold if the hero of the play forms something like an exception to this remark he is the sole exception and for reasons alluded to above his character resembles the author own even with karl the success is incomplete with the other personages it is far more so franz von moor the villain of the piece is an amplified copy of iago and richard but the copy is distorted as well as amplified there is no air of reality in franz he is a villain of theory who studies to accomplish his object by the most diabolical expedients and soothes his conscience by arguing with the priest in favour of atheism and materialism not the genuine villain of shakspeare and nature who employs his reasoning powers in creating new schemes and devising new means and conquers remorse by avoiding it by fixing his hopes and fears on the more pressing emergencies of worldly business so reflective a miscreant as franz could not exist his calculations would lead him to honesty if merely because it was the best policy amelia the only female in the piece is a beautiful creation but as imaginary as her persecutor franz still and exalted in her warm enthusiasm devoted in her love to moor she moves before us as the inhabitant of a higher and simpler world than ours he sails on troubled seas she exclaims with a confusion of metaphors which it is easy to pardon he sails on troubled seas amelia love sails with him he wanders in pathless deserts amelia love makes the burning sand grow green beneath him and the stunted shrubs to blossom the south scorches his bare head his feet are pinched by the northern snow stormy hail beats round his temples amelia love rocks him to sleep in the storm seas and hills and horizons are between us but souls escape from their clay prisons and meet in the paradise of love she is a fair vision the beau id al of a poet first mistress but has few mortal lineaments similar defects are visible in almost all the other characters moor the father is a weak and fond old man who could have arrived at gray hairs in such a state of ignorance nowhere but in a work of fiction the inferior banditti are painted with greater vigour yet still in rugged and illhapen forms their individuality is kept up by an extravagant exaggeration of their several peculiarities schiller himself pronounced a severe but not unfounded censure when he said of this work in a maturer age that his chief fault was in resuming to delineate men two years before he had met one his skill in the art of composition surpassed his knowledge of the world but that too was far from perfection schiller style in the robbers is partly of a kind with the incidents and feelings which it represents strong and astonishing and sometimes wildly grand but likewise inartificial coarse and grotesque his sentences in their rude emphasis come down like the club of hercules the stroke is often of a crushing force but its sweep is irregular and awkward when moor is involved in the deepest intricacies of the old question necessity and free will and has convinced himself that he is but an engine in the hands of some dark and irresistible power he cries out why has my perillus made of me a brazen bull to roast men in my glowing belly the stageirection says haken with horror no wonder that he shook schiller has admitted these faults and explained their origin in strong and sincere language in a passage of which we have already quoted the conclusion singular miscalculation of nature he says ad combined my poetical tendencies with the place of my birth any disposition to poetry did violence to the laws of the institution where i was educated and contradicted the plan of its founder for eight years my enthusiasm struggled with military discipline but the passion for poetry is vehement and fiery as a first love what discipline was meant to extinguish it blew into a flame to escape from arrangements that tortured me my heart sought refuge in the world of ideas when as yet i was unacquainted with the world of realities from which iron bars excluded me i was unacquainted with men for the four hundred that lived with me were but repetitions of the same creature true casts of one single mould and of that very mould which plastic nature solemnly disclaimed thus circumstanced a stranger to human characters and human fortunes to hit the medium line between angels and devils was an enterprise in which i necessarily failed in attempting it my pencil necessarily brought out a monster for which by good fortune the world had no original and which i would not wish to be immortal except to perpetuate an example of the offspring which genius in its unnatural union with thraldom may give to the world i allude to the robbers footnote deutsches museum jahr cited by doering yet with all these excrescences and defects the unbounded popularity of the robbers is not difficult to account for to every reader the excitement of emotion must be a chief consideration to the mass of readers it is the sole one and the grand secret of moving others is that the poet be himself moved we have seen how well schiller temper and circumstances qualified him to fulfil this condition treatment not of his choosing had raised his own mind into something like a pythian frenzy and his genius untrained as it was sufficed to communicate abundance of the feeling to others perhaps more than abundance to judge from our individual impression the perusal of the robbers produces an effect powerful even to pain we are absolutely wounded by the catastrophe our minds are darkened and distressed as if we had witnessed the execution of a criminal it is in vain that we rebel against the inconsistencies and crudities of the work its faults are redeemed by the living energy that pervades it we may exclaim against the blind madness of the hero but there is a towering grandeur about him a whirlwind force of passion and of will which catches our hearts and puts the scruples of criticism to silence the most delirious of enterprises is that of moor but the vastness of his mind renders even that interesting we see him leagued with desperadoes directing their savage strength to actions more and more audacious he is in arms against the conventions of men and the everlasting laws of fate yet we follow him with anxiety through the forests and desert places where he wanders encompassed with peril inspired with lofty daring and torn by unceasing remorse and we wait with awe for the doom which he has merited and cannot avoid nor amid all his frightful aberrations do we ever cease to love him he is an rchangel though in ruins and the strong agony with which he feels the present the certainty of that stern future which awaits him which his own eye never loses sight of makes us lenient to his crimes when he pours forth his wild recollections or still wilder forebodings there is a terrible vehemence in his expressions which overpowers us in spite both of his and their extravagance the scene on the hills beside the danube where he looks at the setting sun and thinks of old hopes and times hen he could not sleep if his evening prayer had been forgotten is one with all its improprieties that ever clings to the memory see he passionately continues all things are gone forth to bask in the peaceful beam of the spring why must i alone inhale the torments of hell out of the joys of heaven that all should be so happy all so married together by the spirit of peace the whole world one family its father above that father not mine i alone the castaway i alone struck out from the company of the just not for me the sweet name of child never for me the languishing look of one whom i love never never the embracing of a bosom friend encircled with murderers serpents hissing around me riveted to vice with iron bonds leaning on the bending reed of vice over the gulf of perdition amid the flowers of the glad world a howling abaddon oh that i might return into my mother womb that i might be born a beggar i would never more o heaven that i could be as one of these dayabourers oh i would toil till the blood ran down from my temples to buy myself the pleasure of one noontide sleep the blessing of a single tear there was a time too when i could weep o ye days of peace thou castle of my father ye green lovely valleys o all ye elysian scenes of my childhood will ye never come again never with your balmy sighing cool my burning bosom mourn with me nature they will never come again never cool my burning bosom with their balmy sighing they are gone gone and may not return no less strange is the soliloquy where moor with the instrument of selfestruction in his hands the read key that is to shut behind him the prison of life and to unbolt before him the dwelling of eternal night meditates on the gloomy enigmas of his future destiny soliloquies on this subject are numerous from the time of hamlet of cato and downwards perhaps the worst of them has more ingenuity perhaps the best of them has less awfulness than the present st dominick himself might shudder at such a question with such an answer as this what if thou shouldst send me companionless to some burnt and blasted circle of the universe which thou hast banished from thy sight where the lone darkness and the motionless desert were my prospects forever i would people the silent wilderness with my fantasies i should have eternity for leisure to examine the perplexed image of the universal woe strength wild impassioned strength is the distinguishing quality of moor all his history shows it and his death is of a piece with the fierce splendour of his life having finished the bloody work of crime and magnanimity and horror he thinks that for himself suicide would be too easy an exit he has noticed a poor man toiling by the wayside for eleven children a great reward has been promised for the head of the robber the gold will nourish that poor drudge and his boys and moor goes forth to give it them we part with him in pity and sorrow looking less at his misdeeds than at their frightful expiation the subordinate personages though diminished in extent and varied in their forms are of a similar quality with the hero a strange mixture of extravagance and true energy in perusing the work which represents their characters and fates we are alternately shocked and inspired there is a perpetual conflict between our understanding and our feelings yet the latter on the whole come off victorious the robbers is a tragedy that will long find readers to astonish and with all its faults to move it stands in our imagination like some ancient rugged pile of a barbarous age irregular fantastic useless but grand in its height and massiveness and black frowning strength it will long remain a singular monument of the early genius and early fortune of its author the publication of such a work as this naturally produced an extraordinary feeling in the literary world translations of the robbers soon appeared in almost all the languages of europe and were read in all of them with a deep interest compounded of admiration and aversion according to the relative proportions of sensibility and judgment in the various minds which contemplated the subject in germany the enthusiasm which the robbers excited was extreme the young author had burst upon the world like a meteor and surprise for a time suspended the power of cool and rational criticism in the ferment produced by the universal discussion of this single topic the poet was magnified above his natural dimensions great as they were and though the general sentence was loudly in his favour yet he found detractors as well as praisers and both equally beyond the limits of moderation one charge brought against him must have damped the joy of literary glory and stung schiller pure and virtuous mind more deeply than any other he was accused of having injured the cause of morality by his work of having set up to the impetuous and fiery temperament of youth a model of imitation which the young were too likely to pursue with eagerness and which could only lead them from the safe and beaten tracks of duty into error and destruction it has even been stated and often been repeated since that a practical exemplification of this doctrine occurred about this time in germany a young nobleman it was said of the fairest gifts and prospects had cast away all these advantages betaken himself to the forests and copying moor had begun a course of active operations which also copying moor but less willingly he had ended by a shameful death it can now be hardly necessary to contradict these theories or to show that none but a candidate for bedlam as well as tyburn could be seduced from the substantial comforts of existence to seek destruction and disgrace for the sake of such imaginary grandeur the german nobleman of the fairest gifts and prospects turns out on investigation to have been a german blackguard whom debauchery and riotous extravagance had reduced to want who took to the highway when he could take to nothing else not allured by an ebullient enthusiasm or any heroical and misdirected appetite for sublime actions but driven by the more palpable stimulus of importunate duns an empty purse and five craving senses perhaps in his later days this philosopher may have referred to schiller tragedy as the source from which he drew his theory of life but if so we believe he was mistaken for characters like him the great attraction was the charms of revelry and the great restraint the gallows before the period of karl von moor just as they have been since and will be to the end of time among motives like these the influence of even the most malignant book could scarcely be discernible and would be little detrimental if it were nothing at any rate could be farther from schiller intention than such a consummation in his preface he speaks of the moral effects of the robbers in terms which do honour to his heart while they show the inexperience of his head ridicule he signifies has long been tried against the wickedness of the times whole cargoes of hellebore have been expended in vain and now he thinks recourse must be had to more pungent medicines we may smile at the simplicity of this idea and safely conclude that like other specifics the present one would fail to produce a perceptible effect but schiller vindication rests on higher grounds than these his work has on the whole furnished nourishment to the more exalted powers of our nature the sentiments and images which he has shaped and uttered tend in spite of their alloy to elevate the soul to a nobler pitch and this is a sufficient defence as to the danger of misapplying the inspiration he communicates of forgetting the dictates of prudence in our zeal for the dictates of poetry we have no great cause to fear it hitherto at least there has always been enough of dull reality on every side of us to abate such fervours in good time and bring us back to the most sober level of prose if not to sink us below it we should thank the poet who performs such a service and forbear to inquire too rigidly whether there is any oral in his piece or not the writer of a work which interests and excites the spiritual feelings of men has as little need to justify himself by showing how it exemplifies some wise saw or modern instance as the doer of a generous action has to demonstrate its merit by deducing it from the system of shaftesbury or smith or paley or whichever happens to be the favourite system for the age and place the instructiveness of the one and the virtue of the other exist independently of all systems or saws and in spite of all but the tragedy of the robbers produced some inconveniences of a kind much more sensible than these its theoretical mischiefs we have called it the signal of schiller deliverance from school tyranny and military constraint but its operation in this respect was not immediate at first it seemed to involve him more deeply and dangerously than before he had finished the original sketch of it in but for fear of offence he kept it secret till his medical studies were completed these in the mean time he had pursued with sufficient assiduity to merit the usual honours in he had in consequence obtained the post of surgeon to the regiment aug in the w rtemberg army this advancement enabled him to complete his project to print the robbers at his own expense not being able to find any bookseller that would undertake it the nature of the work and the universal interest it awakened drew attention to the private circumstances of the author whom the robbers as well as other pieces of his writing that had found their way into the periodical publications of the time sufficiently showed to be no common man many grave persons were offended at the vehement sentiments expressed in the robbers and the unquestioned ability with which these extravagances were expressed but made the matter worse to schiller superiors above all such things were inconceivable he might perhaps be a very great genius but was certainly a dangerous servant for his highness the grand duke of w rtemberg officious people mingled themselves in the affair nay the graziers of the alps were brought to bear upon it the grisons magistrates it appeared had seen the book and were mortally huffed at being there spoken of according to a swabian adage as common highwaymen they complained in the hamburg correspondent and a sort of jackal at ludwigsburg one walter whose name deserves to be thus kept in mind volunteered to plead their cause before the grand duke footnote on this subject doering gives an anecdote which may perhaps be worth translating ne of schiller teachers surprised him on one occasion reciting a scene from the robbers before some of his intimate companions at the words which franz von moor addresses to moser ha what thou knowest none greater think again death heaven eternity damnation hovers in the sound of thy voice not one greater the door opened and the master saw schiller stamping in desperation up and down the room for shame said he for shame to get into such a passion and curse so the other scholars tittered covertly at the worthy inspector and schiller called after him with a bitter smile a noodle ein confiscirter ker footnote his latin essay on the philosophy of physiology was written in and never printed his concluding thesis was published according to custom the subject is arduous enough the connection between the animal and spiritual nature of man which dr cabanis has since treated in so offensive a fashion schiller tract we have never seen doering says it was long ut of print till nasse reproduced it in his medical journal leipzig he is silent respecting its merits footnote the obnoxious passage has been carefully expunged from subsequent editions it was in the third scene of the second act spiegelberg discoursing with razmann observes an honest man you may form of windletraws but to make a rascal you must have grist besides there is a national genius in it a certain rascallimate so to speak in the first edition there was added go to the grisons for instance that is what i call the thief athens the patriot who stood forth on this occasion for the honour of the grisons to deny this weighty charge and denounce the crime of making it was not dogberry or verges but ne of the noble family of salis informed of all these circumstances the grand duke expressed his disapprobation of schiller poetical labours in the most unequivocal terms schiller was at length summoned to appear before him and it then turned out that his highness was not only dissatisfied with the moral or political errors of the work but scandalised moreover at its want of literary merit in this latter respect he was kind enough to proffer his own services but schiller seems to have received the proposal with no sufficient gratitude and the interview passed without advantage to either party it terminated in the duke commanding schiller to abide by medical subjects or at least to beware of writing any more poetry without submitting it to his inspection we need not comment on this portion of the grand duke history his treatment of schiller has already been sufficiently avenged by the great body of mankind his name will be recollected chiefly if at all for the sake of the unfriended youth whom he now schooled so sharply and afterwards afflicted so cruelly it will be recollected also with the angry triumph which we feel against a shallow and despotic oble of convention who strains himself to oppress ne of nature nobility submitted by blind chance to his dominion and finds that he cannot all this is far more than the prince of w rtemberg deserves of limited faculties and educated in the french principles of taste then common to persons of his rank in germany he had perused the robbers with unfeigned disgust he could see in the author only a misguided enthusiast with talents barely enough to make him dangerous and though he never fully or formally retracted this injustice he did not follow it up when schiller became known to the world at large the duke ceased to persecute him the father he still kept in his service and nowise molested in the mean time however various mortifications awaited schiller it was in vain that he discharged the humble duties of his station with the most strict fidelity and even it is said with superior skill he was a suspected person and his most innocent actions were misconstrued his slightest faults were visited with the full measure of official severity his busy imagination aggravated the evil he had seen poor schubart wearing out his tedious eight years of durance in the fortress of asperg because he had been rock of offence to the powers that were the fate of this unfortunate author appeared to schiller a type of his own his free spirit shrank at the prospect of wasting its strength in strife against the pitiful constraints the minute and endless persecutions of men who knew him not yet had his fortune in their hands the idea of dungeons and jailors haunted and tortured his mind and the means of escaping them the renunciation of poetry the source of all his joy if likewise of many woes the radiant guidingtar of his turbid and obscure existence seemed a sentence of death to all that was dignified and delightful and worth retaining in his character totally ignorant of what is called the world conscious too of the might that slumbered in his soul and proud of it as kings are of their sceptres impetuous when roused and spurning unjust restraint yet wavering and timid from the delicacy of his nature and still more restricted in the freedom of his movements by the circumstances of his father whose all depended on the pleasure of the court schiller felt himself embarrassed and agitated and tormented in no common degree urged this way and that by the most powerful and conflicting impulses driven to despair by the paltry shackles that chained him yet forbidden by the most sacred considerations to break them he knew not on what he should resolve he reckoned himself he most unfortunate of men footnote see appendix i no time at length gave him the solution circumstances occurred which forced him to decide the popularity of the robbers had brought him into correspondence with several friends of literature who wished to patronise the author or engage him in new undertakings among this number was the freiherr von dalberg superintendent of the theatre at mannheim under whose encouragement and countenance schiller remodelled the robbers altered it in some parts and had it brought upon the stage in the correspondence with dalberg began in literary discussions but gradually elevated itself into the expression of more interesting sentiments dalberg loved and sympathised with the generous enthusiast involved in troubles and perplexities which his inexperience was so little adequate to thread he gave him advice and assistance and schiller repaid this favour with the gratitude due to his kind his first and then almost his only benefactor his letters to this gentleman have been preserved and lately published they exhibit a lively picture of schiller painful situation at stuttgard and of his unskilful as well as eager anxiety to be delivered from it his darling project was that dalberg should bring him to mannheim as theatrical poet by permission of the duke at one time he even thought of turning player footnote see appendix i no neither of these projects could take immediate effect and schiller embarrassments became more pressing than ever with the natural feeling of a young author he had ventured to go in secret and witness the first representation of his tragedy at mannheim his incognito did not conceal him he was put under arrest during a week for this offence and as the punishment did not deter him from again transgressing in a similar manner he learned that it was in contemplation to try more rigorous measures with him dark hints were given to him of some exemplary as well as imminent severity and dalberg aid the sole hope of averting it by quiet means was distant and dubious schiller saw himself reduced to extremities beleaguered with present distresses and the most horrible forebodings on every side roused to the highest pitch of indignation yet forced to keep silence and wear the face of patience he could endure this maddening constraint no longer he resolved to be free at whatever risk to abandon advantages which he could not buy at such a price to quit his stepame home and go forth though friendless and alone to seek his fortune in the great market of life some foreign duke or prince was arriving at stuttgard and all the people were in movement occupied with seeing the spectacle of his entrance schiller seized this opportunity of retiring from the city careless whither he went so he got beyond the reach of turnkeys and grand dukes and commanding officers it was in the month of october this last step forms the catastrophe of the publication of the robbers it completed the deliverance of schiller from the grating thraldom under which his youth had been passed and decided his destiny for life schiller was in his twentyhird year when he left stuttgard he says e went empty away empty in purse and hope the future was indeed sufficiently dark before him without patrons connexions or country he had ventured forth to the warfare on his own charges without means experience or settled purpose it was greatly to be feared that the fight would go against him yet his situation though gloomy enough was not entirely without its brighter side he was now a free man free however poor and his strong soul quickened as its fetters dropped off and gloried within him in the dim anticipation of great and farxtending enterprises if cast too rudely among the hardships and bitter disquietudes of the world his past nursing had not been delicate he was already taught to look upon privation and discomfort as his daily companions if he knew not how to bend his course among the perplexed vicissitudes of society there was a force within him which would triumph over many difficulties and a ight from heaven was about his path which if it failed to conduct him to wealth and preferment would keep him far from baseness and degrading vices literature and every great and noble thing which the right pursuit of it implies he loved with all his heart and all his soul to this inspiring object he was henceforth exclusively devoted advancing towards this and possessed of common necessaries on the humblest scale there was little else to tempt him his life might be unhappy but would hardly be disgraceful schiller gradually felt all this and gathered comfort while better days began to dawn upon him fearful of trusting himself so near stuttgard as at mannheim he had passed into franconia and was living painfully at oggersheim under the name of schmidt but dalberg who knew all his distresses supplied him with money for immediate wants and a generous lady made him the offer of a home madam von wolzogen lived on her estate of bauerbach in the neighbourhood of meinungen she knew schiller from his works and his intimacy with her sons who had been his fellowtudents at stuttgard she invited him to her house and there treated him with an affection which helped him to forget the past and look cheerfully forward to the future under this hospitable roof schiller had leisure to examine calmly the perplexed and dubious aspect of his affairs happily his character belonged not to the whining or sentimental sort he was not of those in whom the pressure of misfortune produces nothing but unprofitable pain who spend in cherishing and investigating and deploring their miseries the time which should be spent in providing a relief for them with him strong feeling was constantly a call to vigorous action he possessed in a high degree the faculty of conquering his afflictions by directing his thoughts not to maxims for enduring them or modes of expressing them with interest but to plans for getting rid of them and to this disposition or habit too rare among men of genius men of a much higher class than mere sentimentalists but whose sensibility is out of proportion with their inventiveness or activity we are to attribute no small influence in the fortunate conduct of his subsequent life with such a turn of mind schiller now that he was at length master of his own movements could not long be at a loss for plans or tasks once settled at bauerbach he immediately resumed his poetical employments and forgot in the regions of fancy the vague uncertainties of his real condition or saw prospects of amending it in a life of literature by many safe and sagacious persons the prudence of his late proceedings might be more than questioned it was natural for many to forbode that one who left the port so rashly and sailed with such precipitation was likely to make shipwreck ere the voyage had extended far but the lapse of a few months put a stop to such predictions a year had not passed since his departure when schiller sent forth his verschw rung des fiesco and kabale und liebe tragedies which testified that dangerous and arduous as the life he had selected might be he possessed resources more than adequate to its emergencies fiesco he had commenced during the period of his arrest at stuttgard it was published with the other play in and soon after brought upon the mannheim theatre with universal approbation it was now about three years since the composition of the robbers had been finished five since the first sketch of it had been formed with what zeal and success schiller had in that interval pursued the work of his mental culture these two dramas are a striking proof the first ardour of youth is still to be discerned in them but it is now chastened by the dictates of a maturer reason and made to animate the products of a much happier and more skilful invention schiller ideas of art had expanded and grown clearer his knowledge of life had enlarged he exhibits more acquaintance with the fundamental principles of human nature as well as with the circumstances under which it usually displays itself and far higher and juster views of the manner in which its manifestations should be represented in the conspiracy of fiesco we have to admire not only the energetic animation which the author has infused into all his characters but the distinctness with which he has discriminated without aggravating them and the vividness with which he has contrived to depict the scene where they act and move the political and personal relations of the genoese nobility the luxurious splendour the intrigues the feuds and jarring interests which occupy them are made visible before us we understand and may appreciate the complexities of the conspiracy we mingle as among realities in the pompous and imposing movements which lead to the catastrophe the catastrophe itself is displayed with peculiar effect the midnight silence of the sleeping city interrupted only by the distant sounds of watchmen by the low hoarse murmur of the sea or the stealthy footsteps and disguised voice of fiesco is conveyed to our imagination by some brief but graphic touches we seem to stand in the solitude and deep stillness of genoa awaiting the signal which is to burst so fearfully upon its slumber at length the gun is fired and the wild uproar which ensues is no less strikingly exhibited the deeds and sounds of violence astonishment and terror the volleying cannon the heavy toll of the alarmells the acclamation of assembled thousands he voice of genoa speaking with fiesco all is made present to us with a force and clearness which of itself were enough to show no ordinary power of close and comprehensive conception no ordinary skill in arranging and expressing its results but it is not this felicitous delineation of circumstances and visible scenes that constitutes our principal enjoyment the faculty of penetrating through obscurity and confusion to seize the characteristic features of an object abstract or material of producing a lively description in the latter case an accurate and keen scrutiny in the former is the essential property of intellect and occupies in its best form a high rank in the scale of mental gifts but the creative faculty of the poet and especially of the dramatic poet is something superadded to this it is far rarer and occupies a rank far higher in this particular fiesco without approaching the limits of perfection yet stands in an elevated range of excellence the characters on the whole are imagined and portrayed with great impressiveness and vigour traces of old faults are indeed still to be discovered there still seems a want of pliancy about the genius of the author a stiffness and heaviness in his motions his sublimity is not to be questioned but it does not always disdain the aid of rude contrasts and mere theatrical effect he paints in colours deep and glowing but without sufficient skill to blend them delicately he amplifies nature more than purifies it he omits but does not well conceal the omission fiesco has not the complete charm of a true though embellished resemblance to reality its attraction rather lies in a kind of colossal magnitude which requires it if seen to advantage to be viewed from a distance yet the prevailing qualities of the piece do more than make us pardon such defects if the dramatic imitation is not always entirely successful it is never very distant from success and a constant flow of powerful thought and sentiment counteracts or prevents us from noticing the failure we find evidence of great philosophic penetration great resources of invention directed by a skilful study of history and men and everywhere a bold grandeur of feeling and imagery gives life to what study has combined the chief incidents have a dazzling magnificence the chief characters an aspect of majesty and force which corresponds to it fervour of heart capaciousness of intellect and imagination present themselves on all sides the general effect is powerful and exalting fiesco himself is a personage at once probable and tragically interesting the luxurious dissipation in which he veils his daring projects softens the rudeness of that strength which it half conceals his immeasurable pride expands itself not only into a disdain of subjection but also into the most lofty acts of magnanimity his blind confidence in fortune seems almost warranted by the resources which he finds in his own fearlessness and imperturbable presence of mind his ambition participates in the nobleness of his other qualities he is less anxious that his rivals should yield to him in power than in generosity and greatness of character attributes of which power is with him but the symbol and the fit employment ambition in fiesco is indeed the common wish of every mind to diffuse its individual influence to see its own activity reflected back from the united minds of millions but it is the common wish acting on no common man he does not long to rule that he may sway other wills as it were by the physical exertion of his own he would lead us captive by the superior grandeur of his qualities once fairly manifested and he aims at dominion chiefly as it will enable him to manifest these t is not the arena that he values but what lies in that arena the sovereignty is enviable not for its adventitious splendour not because it is the object of coarse and universal wonder but as it offers in the collected force of a nation something which the loftiest mortal may find scope for all his powers in guiding spread out the thunder fiesco exclaims into its single tones and it becomes a lullaby for children pour it forth together in one quick peal and the royal sound shall move the heavens his affections are not less vehement than his other passions his heart can be melted into powerlessness and tenderness by the mild persuasions of his leonora the idea of exalting this amiable being mingles largely with the other motives to his enterprise he is in fact a great and might have been a virtuous man and though in the pursuit of grandeur he swerves from absolute rectitude we still respect his splendid qualities and admit the force of the allurements which have led him astray it is but faintly that we condemn his sentiments when after a night spent in struggles between a rigid and a more accommodating patriotism he looks out of his chamber as the sun is rising in its calm beauty and gilding the waves and mountains and all the innumerable palaces and domes and spires of genoa and exclaims with rapture this majestic city mine to flame over it like the kingly day to brood over it with a monarch power all these sleepless longings all these never satiated wishes to be drowned in that unfathomable ocean we admire fiesco we disapprove of him and sympathise with him he is crushed in the ponderous machinery which himself put in motion and thought to control we lament his fate but confess that it was not undeserved he is a fit of individual freeill to the force of social conventions fiesco is not the only striking character in the play which bears his name the narrow fanatical republican virtue of verrina the mild and venerable wisdom of the old doria the unbridled profligacy of his nephew even the cold contented irreclaimable perversity of the cutthroat moor all dwell in our recollections but what next to fiesco chiefly attracts us is the character of leonora his wife leonora is of kindred to amelia in the robbers but involved in more complicated relations and brought nearer to the actual condition of humanity she is such a heroine as schiller most delights to draw meek and retiring by the softness of her nature yet glowing with an ethereal ardour for all that is illustrious and lovely she clings about her husband as if her being were one with his she dreams of remote and peaceful scenes where fiesco should be all to her she all to fiesco her idea of love is that her name should lie in secret behind every one of his thoughts should speak to him from every object of nature that for him this bright majestic universe itself were but as the shining jewel on which her image only hers stood engraved her character seems a reflection of fiesco but refined from his grosser strength and transfigured into a celestial form of purity and tenderness and touching grace jealousy cannot move her into anger she languishes in concealed sorrow when she thinks herself forgotten it is affection alone that can rouse her into passion but under the influence of this she forgets all weakness and fear she cannot stay in her palace on the night when fiesco destiny is deciding she rushes forth as if inspired to share in her husband dangers and sublime deeds and perishes at last in the tumult the death of leonora so brought about and at such a time is reckoned among the blemishes of the work that of fiesco in which schiller has ventured to depart from history is to be more favourably judged of fiesco is not here accidentally drowned but plunged into the waves by the indignant verrina who forgets or stifles the feelings of friendship in his rage at political apostasy he nature of the drama we are justly told ill not suffer the operation of chance or of an immediate providence higher spirits can discern the minute fibres of an event stretching through the whole expanse of the system of the world and hanging it may be on the remotest limits of the future and the past where man discerns nothing save the action itself hovering unconnected in space but the artist has to paint for the short view of man whom he wishes to instruct not for the piercing eye of superior powers from whom he learns in the composition of fiesco schiller derived the main part of his original materials from history he could increase the effect by gorgeous representations and ideas pre xisting in the mind of his reader enormity of incident and strangeness of situation lent him a similar assistance in the robbers kabale und liebe is destitute of these advantages it is a tragedy of domestic life its means of interesting are comprised within itself and rest on very simple feelings dignified by no very singular action the name courtntriguing and love correctly designates its nature it aims at exhibiting the conflict the victorious conflict of political man uvering of cold worldly wisdom with the pure impassioned movements of the young heart as yet unsullied by the tarnish of everyay life inexperienced in its calculations sick of its empty formalities and indignantly determined to castff the mean restrictions it imposes which bind so firmly by their number though singly so contemptible the idea is far from original this is a conflict which most men have figured to themselves which many men of ardent mind are in some degree constantly waging to make it in this simple form the subject of a drama seems to be a thought of schiller own but the praise though not the merit of his undertaking considerable rather as performed than projected has been lessened by a multitude of worthless or noxious imitations the same primary conception has been tortured into a thousand shapes and tricked out with a thousand tawdry devices and meretricious ornaments by the kotzebues and other ntellectual jacobins whose productions have brought what we falsely call the erman theatre into such deserved contempt in england some portion of the gall due only to these inflated flimsy and fantastic persons appears to have acted on certain critics in estimating this play of schiller august wilhelm schlegel speaks slightingly of the work he says t will hardly move us by its tone of overstrained sensibility but may well afflict us by the painful impressions which it leaves our own experience has been different from that of schlegel in the characters of louisa and ferdinand walter we discovered little overstraining their sensibility we did not reckon very criminal seeing it united with a clearness of judgment chastened by a purity of heart and controlled by a force of virtuous resolution in full proportion with itself we rather admired the genius of the poet which could elevate a poor musicaster daughter to the dignity of a heroine could represent without wounding our sense of propriety the affection of two noble beings created for each other by nature and divided by rank we sympathised in their sentiments enough to feel a proper interest in their fate and see in them what the author meant we should see two pure and lofty minds involved in the meshes of vulgar cunning and borne to destruction by the excess of their own good qualities and the crimes of others ferdinand is a nobleman but not convinced that is patent of nobility is more ancient or of more authority than the primeval scheme of the universe he speaks and acts like a young man entertaining such persuasions disposed to yield everything to reason and true honour but scarcely anything to mere use and wont his passion for louisa is the sign and the nourishment rather than the cause of such a temper he loves her without limit as the only creature he has ever met with of a like mind with himself and this feeling exalts into inspiration what was already the dictate of his nature we accompany him on his straight and plain path we rejoice to see him fling aside with a strong arm the artifices and allurements with which a worthless father and more worthless associates assail him at first in vain there is something attractive in the spectacle of native integrity fearless though inexperienced at war with selfishness and craft something mournful because the victory will seldom go as we would have it louisa is a meet partner for the generous ferdinand the poet has done justice to her character she is timid and humble a feeling and richly gifted soul is hid in her by the unkindness of her earthly lot she is without counsellors except the innate holiness of her heart and the dictates of her keen though untutored understanding yet when the hour of trial comes she can obey the commands of both and draw from herself a genuine nobleness of conduct which secondhand prudence and wealth and titles would but render less touching her filial affection her angelic attachment to her lover her sublime and artless piety are beautifully contrasted with the bleakness of her external circumstances she appears before us like the one rose of the wilderness left on its stalk and we grieve to see it crushed and trodden down so rudely the innocence the enthusiasm the exalted life and stern fate of louisa and ferdinand give a powerful charm to this tragedy it is everywhere interspersed with pieces of fine eloquence and scenes which move us by their dignity or pathos we recollect few passages of a more overpowering nature than the conclusion where ferdinand beguiled by the most diabolical machinations to disbelieve the virtue of his mistress puts himself and her to death by poison there is a gloomy and solemn might in his despair though overwhelmed he seems invincible his enemies have blinded and imprisoned him in their deceptions but only that like samson he may overturn his prisonouse and bury himself and all that have wronged him in its ruins the other characters of the play though in general properly sustained are not sufficiently remarkable to claim much of our attention wurm the chief counsellor and agent of the unprincipled calculating father is wicked enough but there is no great singularity in his wickedness he is little more than the dry cool and now somewhat vulgar miscreant the villanous attorney of modern novels kalb also is but a worthless subject and what is worse but indifferently handled he is meant for the featherrained thing of tags and laces which frequently inhabits courts but he wants the grace and agility proper to the species he is less a fool than a blockhead less perverted than totally inane schiller strength lay not in comedy but in something far higher the great merit of the present work consists in the characters of the hero and heroine and in this respect it ranks at the very head of its class as a tragedy of common life we know of few rivals to it certainly of no superior the production of three such pieces as the robbers fiesco and kabale und liebe already announced to the world that another great and original mind had appeared from whose maturity when such was the promise of its youth the highest expectations might be formed these three plays stand related to each other in regard to their nature and form as well as date they exhibit the progressive state of schiller education show us the fiery enthusiasm of youth exasperated into wildness astonishing in its movements rather than sublime and the same enthusiasm gradually yielding to the sway of reason gradually using itself to the constraints prescribed by sound judgment and more extensive knowledge of the three the robbers is doubtless the most singular and likely perhaps to be the most widely popular but the latter two are of more real worth in the eye of taste and will better bear a careful and rigorous study with the appearance of fiesco and its companion the first period of schiller literary history may conclude the stormy confusions of his youth were now subsiding after all his aberrations repulses and perplexed wanderings he was at length about to reach his true destination and times of more serenity began to open for him two such tragedies as he had lately offered to the world made it easier for his friend dalberg to second his pretensions schiller was at last gratified by the fulfilment of his favourite scheme in september he went to mannheim as poet to the theatre a post of respectability and reasonable profit to the duties of which he forthwith addressed himself with all his heart he was not long afterwards elected a member of the german society established for literary objects in mannheim and he valued the honour not only as a testimony of respect from a highly estimable quarter but also as a means of uniting him more closely with men of kindred pursuits and tempers and what was more than all of quieting forever his apprehensions from the government at stuttgard since his arrival at mannheim one or two suspicious incidents had again alarmed him on this head but being now acknowledged as a subject of the elector palatine naturalised by law in his new country he had nothing more to fear from the duke of w rtemberg satisfied with his moderate income safe free and surrounded by friends that loved and honoured him schiller now looked confidently forward to what all his efforts had been a search and hitherto a fruitless search for an undisturbed life of intellectual labour what effect this happy aspect of his circumstances must have produced upon him may be easily conjectured through many years he had been inured to agitation and distress now peace and liberty and hope sweet in themselves were sweeter for their novelty for the first time in his life he saw himself allowed to obey without reluctance the ruling bias of his nature for the first time inclination and duty went hand in hand his activity awoke with renovated force in this favourable scene longhwarted halforgotten projects again kindled into brightness as the possibility of their accomplishment became apparent schiller glowed with a generous pride when he felt his faculties at his own disposal and thought of the use he meant to make of them my connexions he said re now dissolved the public is now all to me my study my sovereign my confidant to the public alone i henceforth belong before this and no other tribunal will i place myself this alone do i reverence and fear something majestic hovers before me as i determine now to wear no other fetters but the sentence of the world to appeal to no other throne but the soul of man these expressions are extracted from the preface to his thalia a periodical work which he undertook in devoted to subjects connected with poetry and chiefly with the drama in such sentiments we leave him commencing the arduous and perilous but also glorious and sublime duties of a life consecrated to the discovery of truth and the creation of intellectual beauty he was now exclusively what is called a man of letters for the rest of his days part from schiller settlement at mannheim to his settlement at jena part second if to know wisdom were to practise it if fame brought true dignity and peace of mind or happiness consisted in nourishing the intellect with its appropriate food and surrounding the imagination with ideal beauty a literary life would be the most enviable which the lot of this world affords but the truth is far otherwise the man of letters has no immutable allonquering volition more than other men to understand and to perform are two very different things with him as with every one his fame rarely exerts a favourable influence on his dignity of character and never on his peace of mind its glitter is external for the eyes of others within it is but the aliment of unrest the oil cast upon the evernawing fire of ambition quickening into fresh vehemence the blaze which it stills for a moment moreover this man of letters is not wholly made of spirit but of clay and spirit mixed his thinking faculties may be nobly trained and exercised but he must have affections as well as thoughts to make him happy and food and raiment must be given him or he dies far from being the most enviable his way of life is perhaps among the many modes by which an ardent mind endeavours to express its activity the most thickly beset with suffering and degradation look at the biography of authors except the newgate calendar it is the most sickening chapter in the history of man the calamities of these people are a fertile topic and too often their faults and vices have kept pace with their calamities nor is it difficult to see how this has happened talent of any sort is generally accompanied with a peculiar fineness of sensibility of genius this is the most essential constituent and life in any shape has sorrows enough for hearts so formed the employments of literature sharpen this natural tendency the vexations that accompany them frequently exasperate it into morbid soreness the cares and toils of literature are the business of life its delights are too ethereal and too transient to furnish that perennial flow of satisfaction coarse but plenteous and substantial of which happiness in this world of ours is made the most finished efforts of the mind give it little pleasure frequently they give it pain for men aims are ever far beyond their strength and the outward recompense of these undertakings the distinction they confer is of still smaller value the desire for it is insatiable even when successful and when baffled it issues in jealousy and envy and every pitiful and painful feeling so keen a temperament with so little to restrain or satisfy so much to distress or tempt it produces contradictions which few are adequate to reconcile hence the unhappiness of literary men hence their faults and follies thus literature is apt to form a dangerous and discontenting occupation even for the amateur but for him whose rank and worldly comforts depend on it who does not live to write but writes to live its difficulties and perils are fearfully increased few spectacles are more afflicting than that of such a man so gifted and so fated so jostled and tossed to and fro in the rude bustle of life the buffetings of which he is so little fitted to endure cherishing it may be the loftiest thoughts and clogged with the meanest wants of pure and holy purposes yet ever driven from the straight path by the pressure of necessity or the impulse of passion thirsting for glory and frequently in want of daily bread hovering between the empyrean of his fancy and the squalid desert of reality cramped and foiled in his most strenuous exertions dissatisfied with his best performances disgusted with his fortune this man of letters too often spends his weary days in conflicts with obscure misery harassed chagrined debased or maddened the victim at once of tragedy and farce the last forlorn outpost in the war of mind against matter many are the noble souls that have perished bitterly with their tasks unfinished under these corroding woes some in utter famine like otway some in dark insanity like cowper and collins some like chatterton have sought out a more stern quietus and turning their indignant steps away from a world which refused them welcome have taken refuge in that strong fortress where poverty and cold neglect and the thousand natural shocks which flesh is heir to could not reach them any more yet among these men are to be found the brightest specimens and the chief benefactors of mankind it is they that keep awake the finer parts of our souls that give us better aims than power or pleasure and withstand the total sovereignty of mammon in this earth they are the vanguard in the march of mind the intellectual backwoodsmen reclaiming from the idle wilderness new territories for the thought and the activity of their happier brethren pity that from all their conquests so rich in benefit to others themselves should reap so little but it is vain to murmur they are volunteers in this cause they weighed the charms of it against the perils and they must abide the results of their decision as all must the hardships of the course they follow are formidable but not all inevitable and to such as pursue it rightly it is not without its great rewards if an author life is more agitated and more painful than that of others it may also be made more spirittirring and exalted fortune may render him unhappy it is only himself that can make him despicable the history of genius has in fact its bright side as well as its dark and if it is distressing to survey the misery and what is worse the debasement of so many gifted men it is doubly cheering on the other hand to reflect on the few who amid the temptations and sorrows to which life in all its provinces and most in theirs is liable have travelled through it in calm and virtuous majesty and are now hallowed in our memories not less for their conduct than their writings such men are the flower of this lower world to such alone can the epithet of great be applied with its true emphasis there is a congruity in their proceedings which one loves to contemplate e who would write heroic poems should make his whole life a heroic poem so thought our milton and what was more difficult he acted so to milton the moral king of authors a heroic multitude out of many ages and countries might be joined a loud of witnesses that encompass the true literary man throughout his pilgrimage inspiring him to lofty emulation cheering his solitary thoughts with hope teaching him to struggle to endure to conquer difficulties or in failure and heavy sufferings to rm th obdured breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel to this august series in his own degree the name of schiller may be added schiller lived in more peaceful times than milton his history is less distinguished by obstacles surmounted or sacrifices made to principle yet he had his share of trials to encounter and the admirers of his writings need not feel ashamed of the way in which he bore it one virtue the parent of many others and the most essential of any in his circumstances he possessed in a supreme degree he was devoted with entire and unchanging ardour to the cause he had embarked in the extent of his natural endowments might have served with a less eager character as an excuse for long periods of indolence broken only by fits of casual exertion with him it was but a new incitement to improve and develop them the ideal man that lay within him the image of himself as he should be was formed upon a strict and curious standard and to reach this constantly approached and constantly receding emblem of perfection was the unwearied effort of his life this crowning principle of conduct never ceasing to inspire his energetic mind introduced a consistency into his actions a firm coherence into his character which the changeful condition of his history rendered of peculiar importance his resources his place of residence his associates his worldly prospects might vary as they pleased this purpose did not vary it was ever present with him to nerve every better faculty of his head and heart to invest the chequered vicissitudes of his fortune with a dignity derived from himself the zeal of his nature overcame the temptations to that loitering and indecision that fluctuation between sloth and consuming toil that infirmity of resolution with all its tormenting and enfeebling consequences to which a literary man working as he does at a solitary task uncalled for by any pressing tangible demand and to be recompensed by distant and dubious advantage is especially exposed unity of aim aided by ordinary vigour of character will generally insure perseverance a quality not ranked among the cardinal virtues but as essential as any of them to the proper conduct of life nineenths of the miseries and vices of mankind proceed from idleness with men of quick minds to whom it is especially pernicious this habit is commonly the fruit of many disappointments and schemes oft baffled and men fail in their schemes not so much from the want of strength as from the illirection of it the weakest living creature by concentrating his powers on a single object can accomplish something the strongest by dispersing his over many may fail to accomplish anything the drop by continual falling bores its passage through the hardest rock the hasty torrent rushes over it with hideous uproar and leaves no trace behind few men have applied more steadfastly to the business of their life or been more resolutely diligent than schiller the profession of theatrical poet was in his present circumstances particularly favourable to the maintenance of this wholesome state of mind in the fulfilment of its duties while he gratified his own dearest predilections he was likewise warmly seconded by the prevailing taste of the public the interest excited by the stage and the importance attached to everything connected with it are greater in germany than in any other part of europe not excepting france or even paris nor as in paris is the stage in german towns considered merely as a mental recreation an elegant and pleasant mode of filling up the vacancy of tedious evenings in germany it has the advantage of being comparatively new and its exhibitions are directed to a class of minds attuned to a far higher pitch of feeling the germans are accused of a proneness to amplify and systematise to admire with excess and to find in whatever calls forth their applause an epitome of a thousand excellencies which no one else can discover in it their discussions on the theatre do certainly give colour to this charge nothing at least to an english reader can appear more disproportionate than the influence they impute to the stage and the quantity of anxious investigation they devote to its concerns with us the question about the moral tendency of theatrical amusements is now very generally consigned to the meditation of debating clubs and speculative societies of young men under age with our neighbours it is a weighty subject of inquiry for minds of almost the highest order with us the stage is considered as a harmless pastime wholesome because it occupies the man by occupying his mental not his sensual faculties one of the many departments of fictitious representation perhaps the most exciting but also the most transitory sometimes hurtful generally beneficial just as the rest are entitled to no peculiar regard and far inferior in its effect to many others which have no special apparatus for their application the germans on the contrary talk of it as of some new organ for refining the hearts and minds of men a sort of lay pulpit the worthy ally of the sacred one and perhaps even better fitted to exalt some of our nobler feelings because its objects are much more varied and because it speaks to us through many avenues addressing the eye by its pomp and decorations the ear by its harmonies and the heart and imagination by its poetical embellishments and heroic acts and sentiments influences still more mysterious are hinted at if not directly announced an idea seems to lurk obscurely at the bottom of certain of their abstruse and elaborate speculations as if the stage were destined to replace some of those sublime illusions which the progress of reason is fast driving from the earth as if its pageantry and allegories and figurative shadowingorth of things might supply men nature with much of that quickening nourishment which we once derived from the superstitions and mythologies of darker ages viewing the matter in this light they proceed in the management of it with all due earnestness hence their minute and painful investigations of the origin of dramatic emotion of its various kinds and degrees their subdivisions of romantic and heroic and romanticoeroic and the other endless jargon that encumbers their critical writings the zeal of the people corresponds with that of their instructors the want of more important public interests naturally contributes still farther to the prominence of this the discussion of which is not forbidden or sure to be without effect literature attracts nearly all the powerful thought that circulates in germany and the theatre is the great nucleus of german literature it was to be expected that schiller would participate in a feeling so universal and so accordant with his own wishes and prospects the theatre of mannheim was at that period one of the best in germany he felt proud of the share which he had in conducting it and exerted himself with his usual alacrity in promoting its various objects connected with the duties of his office was the more personal duty of improving his own faculties and extending his knowledge of the art which he had engaged to cultivate he read much and studied more the perusal of corneille racine voltaire and the other french classics could not be without advantage to one whose exuberance of power and defect of taste were the only faults he had ever been reproached with and the sounder ideas thus acquired he was constantly busy in exemplifying by attempts of his own his projected translations from shakspeare and the french were postponed for the present indeed except in the instance of macbeth they were never finished his conradin von schwaben and a second part of the robbers were likewise abandoned but a number of minor undertakings sufficiently evinced his diligence and don carlos which he had now seriously commenced was occupying all his poetical faculties another matter he had much at heart was the setting forth of a periodical work devoted to the concerns of the stage in this enterprise schiller had expected the patronage and co peration of the german society of which he was a member it did not strike him that any other motive than a genuine love of art and zeal for its advancement could have induced men to join such a body but the zeal of the german society was more according to knowledge than that of their new associate they listened with approving ear to his vivid representations and widepreading projects but declined taking any part in the execution of them dalberg alone seemed willing to support him mortified but not disheartened by their coldness schiller reckoned up his means of succeeding without them the plan of his work was contracted within narrower limits he determined to commence it on his own resources after much delay the first number of the rheinische thalia enriched by three acts of don carlos appeared in it was continued with one short interruption till the main purpose of the work being the furtherance of dramatic art and the extension and improvement of the public taste for such entertainments its chief contents are easy to be guessed at theatrical criticisms essays on the nature of the stage its history in various countries its moral and intellectual effects and the best methods of producing them a part of the publication was open to poetry and miscellaneous discussion meditating so many subjects so assiduously schiller knew not what it was to be unemployed yet the task of composing dramatic varieties of training players and deliberating in the theatrical senate or even of expressing philosophically his opinions on these points could not wholly occupy such a mind as his there were times when notwithstanding his own prior habits and all the vaunting of dramaturgists he felt that their scenic glories were but an empty show a lying refuge where there was no abiding rest for the soul his eager spirit turned away from their paltry world of pasteboard to dwell among the deep and serious interests of the living world of men the thalia besides its dramatic speculations and performances contains several of his poems which indicate that his attention though officially directed elsewhither was alive to all the common concerns of humanity that he looked on life not more as a writer than as a man the laura whom he celebrates was not a vision of the mind but a living fair one whom he saw daily and loved in the secrecy of his heart his gruppe aus dem tartarus group from tartaru his kindesm rderinn infanticid are products of a mind brooding over dark and mysterious things while improving in the art of poetry in the capability of uttering his thoughts in the form best adapted to express them he was likewise improving in the more valuable art of thought itself and applying it not only to the business of the imagination but also to those profound and solemn inquiries which every reasonable mortal is called to engage with in particular the philosophische briefe written about this period exhibits schiller in a new and to us more interesting point of view julius and raphael are the emblems of his own fears and his own hopes their philosophic letters unfold to us many a gloomy conflict that had passed in the secret chambers of their author soul sceptical doubts on the most important of all subjects were natural to such an understanding as schiller but his heart was not of a temper to rest satisfied with doubts or to draw a sorry compensation for them from the pride of superior acuteness or the vulgar pleasure of producing an effect on others by assailing their dearest and holiest persuasions with him the question about the essence of our being was not a subject for shallow speculation charitably named scientific still less for vain jangling and polemical victories it was a fearful mystery which it concerned all the deepest sympathies and most sublime anticipations of his mind to have explained it is no idle curiosity but the shuddering voice of nature that asks f our happiness depend on the harmonious play of the sensorium if our conviction may waver with the beating of the pulse what schiller ultimate opinions on these points were we are nowhere specially informed that his heart was orthodox that the whole universe was for him a temple in which he offered up the continual sacrifice of devout adoration his works and life bear noble testimony yet here and there his fairest visions seem as if suddenly sicklied over with a pale cast of doubt a withering shadow seems to flit across his soul and chill it in his loftiest moods the dark condition of the man who longs to believe and longs in vain he can represent with a verisimilitude and touching beauty which shows it to have been familiar to himself apart from their ingenuity there is a certain severe pathos in some of these passages which affects us with a peculiar emotion the hero of another work is made to express himself in these terms hat went before and what will follow me i regard as two black impenetrable curtains which hang down at the two extremities of human life and which no living man has yet drawn aside many hundreds of generations have already stood before them with their torches guessing anxiously what lies behind on the curtain of futurity many see their own shadows the forms of their passions enlarged and put in motion they shrink in terror at this image of themselves poets philosophers and founders of states have painted this curtain with their dreams more smiling or more dark as the sky above them was cheerful or gloomy and their pictures deceive the eye when viewed from a distance many jugglers too make profit of this our universal curiosity by their strange mummeries they have set the outstretched fancy in amazement a deep silence reigns behind this curtain no one once within it will answer those he has left without all you can hear is a hollow echo of your question as if you shouted into a chasm to the other side of this curtain we are all bound men grasp hold of it as they pass trembling uncertain who may stand within it to receive them quid sit id quod tantum morituri vident some unbelieving people there have been who have asserted that this curtain did but make a mockery of men and that nothing could be seen because nothing was behind it but to convince these people the rest have seized them and hastily pushed them in footnote der geisterseher schillers werke b p the philosophic letters paint the struggles of an ardent enthusiastic inquisitive spirit to deliver itself from the harassing uncertainties to penetrate the dread obscurity which overhangs the lot of man the first faint scruples of the doubter are settled by the maxim elieve nothing but thy own reason there is nothing holier than truth but reason employed in such an inquiry can do but half the work she is like the conjuror that has pronounced the spell of invocation but has forgot the counterord spectres and shadowy forms come crowding at his summons in endless multitudes they press and hover round his magic circle and the terrortruck blackrtist cannot lay them julius finds that on rejecting the primary dictates of feeling the system of dogmatical belief he is driven to the system of materialism recoiling in horror from this dead and cheerless creed he toils and wanders in the labyrinths of pantheism seeking comfort and rest but finding none till baffled and tired and sick at heart he seems inclined as far as we can judge to renounce the dreary problem altogether to shut the eyes of his too keen understanding and take refuge under the shade of revelation the anxieties and errors of julius are described in glowing terms his intellectual subtleties are mingled with the eloquence of intense feeling the answers of his friend are in a similar style intended not more to convince than to persuade the whole work is full of passion as well as acuteness the impress of a philosophic and poetic mind striving with all its vast energies to make its poetry and its philosophy agree considered as exhibiting the state of schiller thoughts at this period it possesses a peculiar interest in other respects there is little in it to allure us it is short and incomplete there is little originality in the opinions it expresses and none in the form of its composition as an argument on either side it is too rhetorical to be of much weight it abandons the inquiry when its difficulties and its value are becoming greatest and breaks off abruptly without arriving at any conclusion schiller has surveyed the dark serbonian bog of infidelity but he has made no causeway through it the philosophic letters are a fragment amid employments so varied with health and freedom from the coarser hardships of life schiller feelings might be earnest but could scarcely be unhappy his mild and amiable manners united to such goodness of heart and such height of accomplishment endeared him to all classes of society in mannheim dalberg was still his warm friend schwann and laura he conversed with daily his genius was fast enlarging its empire and fast acquiring more complete command of it he was loved and admired rich in the enjoyment of present activity and fame and richer in the hope of what was coming yet in proportion as his faculties and his prospects expanded he began to view his actual situation with less and less contentment for a season after his arrival it was natural that mannheim should appear to him as land does to the shipwrecked mariner full of gladness and beauty merely because it is land it was equally natural that after a time this sentiment should abate and pass away that his place of refuge should appear but as other places only with its difficulties and discomforts aggravated by their nearness his revenue was inconsiderable here and dependent upon accidents for its continuance a share in directing the concerns of a provincial theatre a task not without its irritations was little adequate to satisfy the wishes of a mind like his schiller longed for a wider sphere of action the world was all before him he lamented that he should still be lingering on the mere outskirts of its business that he should waste so much time and effort in contending with the irascible vanity of players or watching the ebbs and flows of public taste in resisting small grievances and realising a small result he determined upon leaving mannheim if destitute of other holds his prudence might still have taught him to smother this unrest the neverailing inmate of every human breast and patiently continue where he was but various resources remained to him and various hopes invited him from other quarters the produce of his works or even the exercise of his profession would insure him a competence anywhere the former had already gained him distinction and goodwill in every part of germany the first number of his thalia had arrived at the court of hessenarmstadt while the duke of sachseneimar happened to be there the perusal of the first acts of don carlos had introduced the author to that enlightened prince who expressed his satisfaction and respect by transmitting him the title of counsellor a less splendid but not less truthful or pleasing testimonial had lately reached him from leipzig ome days ago he writes met with a very flattering and agreeable surprise there came to me out of leipzig from unknown hands four parcels and as many letters written with the highest enthusiasm towards me and overflowing with poetical devotion they were accompanied by four miniature portraits two of which are of very beautiful young ladies and by a pocketook sewed in the finest taste such a present from people who can have no interest in it but to let me know that they wish me well and thank me for some cheerful hours i prize extremely the loudest applause of the world could scarcely have flattered me so agreeably perhaps this incident trifling as it was might not be without effect in deciding the choice of his future residence leipzig had the more substantial charm of being a centre of activity and commerce of all sorts that of literature not excepted and it contained some more effectual friends of schiller than these his unseen admirers he resolved on going thither his wishes and intentions are minutely detailed to huber his chief intimate at leipzig in a letter written shortly before his removal we translate it for the hints it gives us of schiller tastes and habits at that period of his history his then is probably the last letter i shall write to you from mannheim the time from the fifteenth of march has hung upon my hands like a trial for life and thank heaven i am now ten whole days nearer you and now my good friend as you have already consented to take my entire confidence upon your shoulders allow me the pleasure of leading you into the interior of my domestic wishes n my new establishment at leipzig i purpose to avoid one error which has plagued me a great deal here in mannheim it is this no longer to conduct my own housekeeping and also no longer to live alone the former is not by any means a business i excel in it costs me less to execute a whole conspiracy in five acts than to settle my domestic arrangements for a week and poetry you yourself know is but a dangerous assistant in calculations of economy my mind is drawn different ways i fall headlong out of my ideal world if a holed stocking remind me of the real world s to the other point i require for my private happiness to have a true warm friend that would be ever at my hand like my better angel to whom i could communicate my nascent ideas in the very act of conceiving them not needing to transmit them as at present by letters or long visits nay when this friend of mine lives beyond the four corners of my house the trifling circumstance that in order to reach him i must cross the street dress myself and so forth will of itself destroy the enjoyment of the moment and the train of my thoughts is torn in pieces before i see him bserve you my good fellow these are petty matters but petty matters often bear the weightiest result in the management of life i know myself better than perhaps a thousand mothers sons know themselves i understand how much and frequently how little i require to be completely happy the question therefore is can i get this wish of my heart fulfilled in leipzig f it were possible that i could make a lodgment with you all my cares on that head would be removed i am no bad neighbour as perhaps you imagine i have pliancy enough to suit myself to another and here and there withal a certain knack as yorick says at helping to make him merrier and better failing this if you could find me any person that would undertake my small economy everything would still be well want nothing but a bedroom which might also be my working room and another chamber for receiving visits the houseear necessary for me are a good chest of drawers a desk a bed and sofa a table and a few chairs with these conveniences my accommodation were sufficiently provided for cannot live on the groundloor nor close by the ridgeile also my windows positively must not look into the churchyard i love men and therefore like their bustle if i cannot so arrange it that we meaning the quintuple alliance shall mess together i would engage at the table te of the inn for i had rather fast than eat without company large or else particularly good footnote who the other three were is nowhere particularly mentioned write all this to you my dearest friend to forewarn you of my silly tastes and at all events that i may put it in your power to take some preparatory steps in one place or another for my settlement my demands are in truth confoundedly na ve but your goodness has spoiled me he first part of the thalia must already be in your possession the doom of carlos will ere now be pronounced yet i will take it from you orally had we five not been acquainted who knows but we might have become so on occasion of this very carlos schiller went accordingly to leipzig though whether huber received him or he found his humble necessaries elsewhere we have not learned he arrived in the end of march after eighteen months residence at mannheim the reception he met with his amusements occupations and prospects are described in a letter to the kammerrath schwann a bookseller at mannheim alluded to above except dalberg schwann had been his earliest friend he was now endeared to him by subsequent familiarity not of letters and writing but of daily intercourse and what was more than all by the circumstance that laura was his daughter the letter it will be seen was written with a weightier object than the pleasure of describing leipzig it is dated th april ou have an indubitable right to be angry at my long silence yet i know your goodness too well to be in doubt that you will pardon me hen a man unskilled as i am in the busy world visits leipzig for the first time during the fair it is if not excusable at least intelligible that among the multitude of strange things running through his head he should for a few days lose recollection of himself such my dearest friend has till today been nearly my case and even now i have to steal from many avocations the pleasing moments which in idea i mean to spend with you at mannheim ur journey hither of which herr g tz will give you a circumstantial description was the most dismal you can well imagine bog snow and rain were the three wicked foes that by turns assailed us and though we used an additional pair of horses all the way from vach yet our travelling which should have ended on friday was spunut till sunday it is universally maintained that the fair has visibly suffered by the shocking state of the roads at all events even in my eyes the crowd of sellers and buyers is far beneath the description i used to get of it in the empire n the very first week of my residence here i made innumerable new acquaintances among whom weisse oeser hiller zollikofer professor huber j nger the famous actor reinike a few merchants families of the place and some berlin people are the most interesting during fairime as you know well a person cannot get the full enjoyment of any one our attention to the individual is dissipated in the noisy multitude y most pleasant recreation hitherto has been to visit richter coffeeouse where i constantly find half the world of leipzig assembled and extend my acquaintance with foreigners and natives rom various quarters i have had some alluring invitations to berlin and dresden which it will be difficult for me to withstand it is quite a peculiar case my friend to have a literary name the few men of worth and consideration who offer you their intimacy on that score and whose regard is really worth coveting are too disagreeably counterweighed by the baleful swarm of creatures who keep humming round you like so many fleshlies gape at you as if you were a monster and condescend moreover on the strength of one or two blotted sheets to present themselves as colleagues many people cannot understand how a man that wrote the robbers should look like another son of adam closeut hair at the very least and postillion boots and a hunter whip were expected any families are in the habit here of spending the summer in some of the adjacent villages and so enjoying the pleasures of the country i mean to pass a few months in gohlis which lies only a quarter of a league from leipzig with a very pleasant walk leading to it through the rosenthal here i purpose being very diligent working at carlos and the thalia that so which perhaps will please you more than anything i may gradually and silently return to my medical profession i long impatiently for that epoch of my life when my prospects may be settled and determined when i may follow my darling pursuits merely for my own pleasure at one time i studied medicine con amore could i not do it now with still greater keenness his my best friend might of itself convince you of the truth and firmness of my purpose but what should offer you the most complete security on that point what must banish all your doubts about my steadfastness i have yet kept secret now or never i must speak it out distance alone gives me courage to express the wish of my heart frequently enough when i used to have the happiness of being near you has this confession hovered on my tongue but my confidence always forsook me when i tried to utter it my best friend your goodness your affection your generosity of heart have encouraged me in a hope which i can justify by nothing but the friendship and respect you have always shown me my free unconstrained access to your house afforded me the opportunity of intimate acquaintance with your amiable daughter and the frank kind treatment with which both you and she honoured me tempted my heart to entertain the bold wish of becoming your son my prospects have hitherto been dim and vague they now begin to alter in my favour i will strive with more continuous vigour when the goal is clear do you decide whether i can reach it when the dearest wish of my heart supports my zeal et two short years and my whole fortune will be determined i feel how much i ask how boldly and with how little right i ask it a year is past since this thought took possession of my soul but my esteem for you and your excellent daughter was too high to allow room for a wish which at that time i could found on no solid basis i made it a duty with myself to visit your house less frequently and to dissipate such feelings by absence but this poor artifice did not avail me he duke of weimar was the first person to whom i disclosed myself his anticipating goodness and the declaration that he took an interest in my happiness induced me to confess that this happiness depended on a union with your noble daughter and he expressed his satisfaction at my choice i have reason to hope that he will do more should it come to the point of completing my happiness by this union shall add nothing farther i know well that hundreds of others might afford your daughter a more splendid fate than i at this moment can promise her but that any other heart can be more worthy of her i venture to deny your decision which i look for with impatience and fearful expectation will determine whether i may venture to write in person to your daughter fare you well forever loved by your riedrich schiller concerning this proposal we have no farther information to communicate except that the parties did not marry and did not cease being friends that schiller obtained the permission he concludes with requesting appears from other sources three years afterwards in writing to the same person he alludes emphatically to his eldest daughter and what is more ominous apologises for his silence to her schiller situation at this period was such as to preclude the idea of present marriage perhaps in the prospect of it laura and he commenced corresponding and before the wishedor change of fortune had arrived both of them attracted to other objects had lost one another in the vortex of life and ceased to regard their finding one another as desirable schiller medical project like many which he formed never came to any issue in moments of anxiety amid the fluctuations of his lot the thought of this profession floated through his mind as of a distant stronghold to which in time of need he might retire but literature was too intimately interwoven with his dispositions and his habits to be seriously interfered with it was only at brief intervals that the pleasure of pursuing it exclusively seemed overbalanced by its inconveniences he needed a more certain income than poetry could yield him but he wished to derive it from some pursuit less alien to his darling study medicine he never practised after leaving stuttgard in the mean time whatever he might afterwards resolve on he determined to complete his carlos the half of which composed a considerable time before had lately been running the gauntlet of criticism in the thalia with this for his chief occupation gohlis or leipzig for his residence and a circle of chosen friends for his entertainment schiller days went happily along his lied an die freude song to jo one of his most spirited and beautiful lyrical productions was composed here it bespeaks a mind impetuous even in its gladness and overflowing with warm and earnest emotions footnote wieland rather harsh and not too judicious sentence on it may be seen at large in gruber wieland geschildert b s but the love of change is grounded on the difference between anticipation and reality and dwells with man till the age when habit becomes stronger than desire or anticipation ceases to be hope schiller did not find that his establishment at leipzig though pleasant while it lasted would realise his ulterior views he yielded to some of his invitations and went to dresden in the end of summer dresden contained many persons who admired him more who admired his fame and a few who loved himself among the latter the appellationsrath k rner deserves especial mention schiller found a true friend in k rner and made his house a home he parted his time between dresden and schwitz near it where that gentleman resided it was here that don

without meat or drink or even wood for fuel still farther exasperated by the dabbling of some washeraids beneath his window he produced these lines the poem is of the kind which cannot be translated the first three stanzas are as follows die w sche klatscht vor meiner th r es plarrt die k chenzofe und mich mich fuhrt das fl gelthier zu k nig philips hofe ich eile durch die gallerie mit schnellem schritt belausche dort die prinzessin eboli im s liebesrausche schon ruft das sch ne weib triumph schon h r ich tod und h was h r ich einen nassen strumpf geworfen in die welle the story of don carlos seems peculiarly adapted for dramatists the spectacle of a royal youth condemned to death by his father of which happily our european annals furnish but another example is among the most tragical that can be figured the character of that youth the intermixture of bigotry and jealousy and love with the other strong passions which brought on his fate afford a combination of circumstances affecting in themselves and well calculated for the basis of deeply interesting fiction accordingly they have not been neglected carlos has often been the theme of poets particularly since the time when his history recorded by the abb st r al was exposed in more brilliant colours to the inspection of every writer and almost of every reader the abb st r al was a dexterous artist in that halfllicit species of composition the historic novel in the course of his operations he lighted on these incidents and by fillingp according to his fancy what historians had only sketched to him by amplifying beautifying suppressing and arranging he worked the whole into a striking little narrative distinguished by all the symmetry the sparkling graces the vigorous description and keen thought which characterise his other writings this french sallust as his countrymen have named him has been of use to many dramatists his conjuraison contre venise furnished otway with the outline of his best tragedy epicaris has more than once appeared upon the stage and don carlos has been dramatised in almost all the languages of europe besides otway carlos so famous at its first appearance many tragedies on this subject have been written most of them are gathered to their final rest some are fast going thither two bid fair to last for ages schiller and alfieri have both drawn their plot from st r al the former has expanded and added the latter has compressed and abbreviated schiller carlos is the first of his plays that bears the stamp of anything like full maturity the opportunities he had enjoyed for extending his knowledge of men and things the sedulous practice of the art of composition the study of purer models had not been without their full effect increase of years had done something for him diligence had done much more the ebullience of youth is now chastened into the steadfast energy of manhood the wild enthusiast that spurned at the errors of the world has now become the enlightened moralist that laments their necessity or endeavours to find out their remedy a corresponding alteration is visible in the external form of the work in its plot and diction the plot is contrived with great ingenuity embodying the result of much study both dramatic and historical the language is blank verse not prose as in the former works it is more careful and regular less ambitious in its object but more certain of attaining it schiller mind had now reached its full stature he felt and thought more justly he could better express what he felt and thought the merit we noticed in fiesco the fidelity with which the scene of action is brought before us is observable to a still greater degree in don carlos the spanish court in the end of the sixteenth century its rigid cold formalities its cruel bigoted but proudpirited grandees its inquisitors and priests and philip its head the epitome at once of its good and its bad qualities in all his complex interests are exhibited with wonderful distinctness and address nor is it at the surface or the outward movements alone that we look we are taught the mechanism of their characters as well as shown it in action the stonyearted despot himself must have been an object of peculiar study to the author narrow in his understanding dead in his affections from his birth the lord of europe philip has existed all his days above men not among them locked up within himself a stranger to every generous and kindly emotion his gloomy spirit has had no employment but to strengthen or increase its own elevation no pleasure but to gratify its own selfill superstition harmonising with these native tendencies has added to their force but scarcely to their hatefulness it lends them a sort of sacredness in his own eyes and even a sort of horrid dignity in ours philip is not without a certain greatness the greatness of unlimited external power and of a will relentless in its dictates guided by principles false but consistent and unalterable the scene of his existence is haggard stern and desolate but it is all his own and he seems fitted for it we hate him and fear him but the poet has taken care to secure him from contempt the contrast both of his father fortune and character are those of carlos few situations of a more affecting kind can be imagined than the situation of this young generous and illated prince from boyhood his heart had been bent on mighty things he had looked upon the royal grandeur that awaited his maturer years only as the means of realising those projects for the good of men which his beneficent soul was ever busied with his father dispositions and the temper of the court which admitted no development of such ideas had given the charm of concealment to his feelings his life had been in prospect and we are the more attached to him that deserving to be glorious and happy he had but expected to be either bright days however seemed approaching shut out from the communion of the albas and domingos among whom he lived a stranger the communion of another and far dearer object was to be granted him elizabeth love seemed to make him independent even of the future which it painted with still richer hues but in a moment she is taken from him by the most terrible of all visitations his bride becomes his mother and the stroke that deprives him of her while it ruins him forever is more deadly because it cannot be complained of without sacrilege and cannot be altered by the power of fate itself carlos as the poet represents him calls forth our tenderest sympathies his soul seems once to have been rich and glorious like the garden of eden but the desertind has passed over it and smitten it with perpetual blight despair has overshadowed all the fair visions of his youth or if he hopes it is but the gleam of delirium which something sterner than even duty extinguishes in the cold darkness of death his energy survives but to vent itself in wild gusts of reckless passion or aimless indignation there is a touching poignancy in his expression of the bitter melancholy that oppresses him in the fixedness of misery with which he looks upon the faded dreams of former years or the fierce ebullitions and dreary pauses of resolution which now prompts him to retrieve what he has lost now withers into powerlessness as nature and reason tell him that it cannot must not be retrieved elizabeth no less moving and attractive is also depicted with masterly skill if she returns the passion of her amiable and once betrothed lover we but guess at the fact for so horrible a thought has never once been whispered to her own gentle and spotless mind yet her heart bleeds for carlos and we see that did not the most sacred feelings of humanity forbid her there is no sacrifice she would not make to restore his peace of mind by her soothing influence she strives to calm the agony of his spirit by her mild winning eloquence she would persuade him that for don carlos other objects must remain when his hopes of personal felicity have been cut off she would change his love for her into love for the millions of human beings whose destiny depends on his a meek vestal yet with the prudence of a queen and the courage of a matron with every graceful and generous quality of womanhood harmoniously blended in her nature she lives in a scene that is foreign to her the happiness she should have had is beside her the misery she must endure is around her yet she utters no regret gives way to no complaint but seeks to draw from duty itself a compensation for the cureless evil which duty has inflicted many tragic queens are more imposing and majestic than this elizabeth of schiller but there is none who rules over us with a sway so soft and feminine none whom we feel so much disposed to love as well as reverence the virtues of elizabeth are heightened by comparison with the principles and actions of her attendant the princess eboli the character of eboli is full of pomp and profession magnanimity and devotedness are on her tongue some shadow of them even floats in her imagination but they are not rooted in her heart pride selfishness unlawful passion are the only inmates there her lofty boastings of generosity are soon forgotten when the success of her attachment to carlos becomes hopeless the fervour of a selfish love once extinguished in her bosom she regards the object of it with none but vulgar feelings virtue no longer according with interest she ceases to be virtuous from a rejected mistress the transition to a jealous spy is with her natural and easy yet we do not hate the princess there is a seductive warmth and grace about her character which makes us lament her vices rather than condemn them the poet has drawn her at once false and fair in delineating eboli and philip schiller seems as if struggling against the current of his nature our feelings towards them are hardly so severe as he intended their words and deeds at least those of the latter are wicked and repulsive enough but we still have a kind of latent persuasion that they meant better than they spoke or acted with the marquis of posa he had a more genial task this posa we can easily perceive is the representative of schiller himself the ardent love of men which forms his ruling passion was likewise the constant feeling of his author the glowing eloquence with which he advocates the cause of truth and justice and humanity was such as schiller too would have employed in similar circumstances in some respects posa is the chief character of the piece there is a pre minent magnificence in his object and in the faculties and feelings with which he follows it of a splendid intellect and a daring devoted heart his powers are all combined upon a single purpose even his friendship for carlos grounded on the likeness of their minds and faithful as it is yet seems to merge in this paramount emotion zeal for the universal interests of man aiming with all his force of thought and action to advance the happiness and best rights of his fellowreatures pursuing this noble aim with the skill and dignity which it deserves his mind is at once unwearied earnest and serene he is another carlos but somewhat older more experienced and never crossed in hopeless love there is a calm strength in posa which no accident of fortune can shake whether cheering the forlorn carlos into new activity whether lifting up his voice in the ear of tyrants and inquisitors or taking leave of life amid his vast unexecuted schemes there is the same sedate magnanimity the same fearless composure when the fatal bullet strikes him he dies with the concerns of others not his own upon his lips he is a reformer the perfection of reformers not a revolutionist but a prudent though determined improver his enthusiasm does not burst forth in violence but in manly and enlightened energy his eloquence is not more moving to the heart than his lofty philosophy is convincing to the head there is a majestic vastness of thought in his precepts which recommends them to the mind independently of the beauty of their dress few passages of poetry are more spirittirring than his last message to carlos through the queen the certainty of death seems to surround his spirit with a kind of martyr glory he is kindled into transport and speaks with a commanding power the pathetic wisdom of the line ell him that when he is a man he must reverence the dreams of his youth has often been admired that scene has many such the interview with philip is not less excellent there is something so striking in the idea of confronting the cold solitary tyrant with he only man in all his states that does not need him of raising the voice of true manhood for once within the gloomy chambers of thraldom and priestcraft that we can forgive the stretch of poetic license by which it is effected philip and posa are antipodes in all respects philip thinks his new instructor is protestant a charge which posa rebuts with calm dignity his object not being separation and contention but union and peaceful gradual improvement posa seems to understand the character of philip better not attempting to awaken in his sterile heart any feeling for real glory or the interests of his fellowen he attacks his selfishness and pride represents to him the intrinsic meanness and misery of a throne however decked with adventitious pomp if built on servitude and isolated from the sympathies and interests of others we translate the entire scene though not by any means the best it is among the fittest for extraction of any in the piece posa has been sent for by the king and is waiting in a chamber of the palace to know what is required of him the king enters unperceived by posa whose attention is directed to a picture on the wall act scene the king and marquis de posa the latter on noticing the king advances towards him and kneels then rises and waits without any symptom of embarrassment king looks at him with surprise we have met before then mar no king you did my crown some service wherefore have you shunn my thanks our memory is besieged

selection not the force of duty should impel me is it thus your majesty requires it could you suffer new creators in your own creation or could i consent with patience to become the chisel when i hoped to be the statuary i love mankind and in a monarchy myself is all that i can love king this fire is laudable you would do good to others how you do it patriots wise men think of little moment so it be but done seek for yourself the office in my kingdoms that will give you scope to gratify this noble zeal mar there is not such an office king how mar what the king desires to spread abroad through these weak hands is it the good of men that good which my unfetter love would wish them pale majesty would tremble to behold it no policy has fashioned in her courts another sort of human good a sort which she is rich enough to give away awakening with it in the hearts of men new cravings such as it can satisfy truth she keeps coining in her mints such truth as she can tolerate and every

when he dare not think sire choose some other to dispense the good which you have stamped for us with me it tallies not a prince servant i cannot be king rather quickly you are a protestant mar after some reflection sire your creed is also mine after a pause i find i am misunderstood is as i feared you see me draw the veil from majesty and view its mysteries with steadfast eye how should you know if i regard as holy what i no more regard as terrible dangerous i seem for bearing thoughts too high my king i am not dangerous my wishes lie buried here laying his hand on his breast the poor and purblind rage of innovation that but aggravates the weight o th fetters which it cannot break will never heat my blood the century admits not my ideas i live a citizen of those that are to come sire can a picture break your rest your breath obliterates it king no other knows you harbour such ideas mar such no one king rises walks a few steps then stops opposite the marquis aside new at least this dialect flattery exhausts itself a man of parts disdains to imitate for once let have a trial of the opposite why not the strange is oft the lucky if so be this is your principle why let it pass i will conform the crown shall have a servant new in spain a liberal mar sire i see how very meanly you conceive of men how in the language of the frank true spirit you find but another deeper artifice of a more practis cozer i can also partly see what causes this is men is men that force you to it they themselves have cast away their own nobility themselves have crouch to this degraded posture man innate greatness like a spectre frights them their poverty seems safety with base skill they ornament their chains and call it virtue to wear them with an air of grace twas thus you found the world thus from your royal father came it to you how in this distorted mutilated image could you honour man king some truth there is in this mar pity however that in taking man from the creator and changing him into your handiwork and setting up yourself to be the god of this newoulded creature you should have forgotten one essential you yourself remained a man a very child of adam you are still a suffering longing mortal you call for sympathy and to a god we can but sacrifice and pray and tremble o unwise exchange unbless perversion when you have sunk your brothers to be play as harptrings who

frightful were it if you failed in this if for the desolated good of millions you the desolator should gain nothing if the very freedom you have blighted and kill were that alone which could exalt yourself sire pardon me i must not stay the matter makes me rash my heart is full too strong the charm of looking on the one of living men to whom i might unfold it the count de lerma enters and whispers a few words to the king the latter beckons to him to withdraw and continues sitting in his former posture king to the marquis after lerma is gone speak on mar after a pause i feel sire all the worth king speak on y had something more to say mar not long since sire i chanced to pass through flanders and brabant so many rich and flourishing provinces a great a mighty people and still more an honest people and this people father that thought i must be divine so thinking i stumbled on a heap of human bones he pauses his eyes rest on the king who endeavours to return his glance but with an air of embarrassment is forced to look upon the ground you are in the right you must proceed so that you could do what you saw you must do fills me with a shuddering admiration pity that the victim welting in its blood should speak so feeble an eulogium on the spirit of the priest that mere men not beings of a calmer essence write the annals of the world serener ages will displace the age of philip these will bring a milder wisdom the subject good will then be reconcil to th prince greatness the thrifty state will learn to prize its children and necessity no more will be inhuman king and when think you would those blessed ages have come round had i recoil before the curse of this behold my spain here blooms the subject good in neverlouded peace such peace will i bestow on flanders mar

restore to us what you have taken from us generous as strong let human happiness stream from your horn of plenty let souls ripen round you restore us what you took from us amid a thousand kings become

that kindles in your eyes give up this false idolatry of self which makes your brothers nothing be to us a pattern of the everlasting and the true never never did a mortal hold so much to use it so divinely all the kings of europe reverence the name of spain go on in front of all the kings of europe one movement of your pen and newreated is the earth say but let there be freedom throwing himself at his feet king surprised turning his face away then again towards posa singular enthusiast yet rise i mar look round and view god lordly universe on freedom it is founded and how rich is it with freedom he the great creator has giv the very worm its seval dewdrop ev in the mouldering spaces of decay he leaves freeill the pleasures of a choice this world of yours how narrow and how poor the rustling of a leaf alarms the lord of christendom you quake at every virtue he not to mar the glorious form of freedom suffers that the hideous hosts of evil should run riot in his fair creation him the maker we behold not calm he veils himself in everlasting laws which and not him the sceptic seeing exclaims herefore a god the world itself is god and never did a christian adoration so praise him as this sceptic blasphemy king and such a model you would undertake on earth in my domains to imitate mar you you can who else to th people good devote the kingly power which far too long has struggled for the greatness of the throne restore the lost nobility of man once more make of the subject what he was the purpose of the crown let no tie bind him except his brethren right as sacred as his own and when given back to selfependence man awakens to the feeling of his worth and freedom proud and lofty virtues blossom then sire having made your realms the happiest in the earth it may become your duty to subdue the realms of others king after a long pause i have heard you to an end not as in common heads the world is painted in that head of yours nor will i mete you by the common standard i am the first to whom your heart has been disclosed i know this so believe it for the sake of such forbearance for your having kept ideas embraced with such devotion secret up to this present moment for the sake of that reserve young man i will forget that i have learned them and how i learned them arise the headlong youth i will set right not as his sovereign but as his senior i will because i will so bane itself i find in generous natures may become ennobled into something better but beware my inquisition it would grieve me if you mar would it would it king gazing at him and lost in surprise such a mortal till this hour i never saw no marquis no you do me wrong to you i will not be a nero not to you all happiness shall not be blighted by me you yourself shall be permitted to remain a man beside me mar quickly and my fellowubjects sire oh not for me not my cause was i pleading and your subjects sire king you see so clearly how posterity will judge of me yourself shall teach it how i treated men so soon as i had found one mar o sire in being the most just of kings at the same instant be not the most unjust in your flanders are many thousands worthier than i is but yourself shall i confess it sire that under this mild form first truly see what freedom is king with softened earnestness young man no more of this far differently will you think of men when you have seen and studied them as i have yet our first meeting must not be our last how shall i try to make you mine mar sire let me continue as i am what good were it to you if i like others were corrupted king this pride i will not suffer from this moment you are in my service no remonstrance i will have it so had the character of posa been drawn ten years later it would have been imputed as all things are to the rench revolution and schiller himself perhaps might have been called a jacobin happily as matters stand there is room for no such imputation it is pleasing to behold in posa the deliberate expression of a great and good man sentiments on these evergitated subjects a noble monument embodying the liberal ideas of his age in a form beautified by his own genius and lasting as its other products footnote jean paul nevertheless not without some show of reason has compared this posa to the tower of a lighthouse igh farhining empty note of connected with the superior excellence of posa critics have remarked a dramatic error which the author himself was the first to acknowledge and account for the magnitude of posa throws carlos into the shade the hero of the first three acts is no longer the hero of the other two the cause of this we are informed was that schiller kept the work too long upon his own hands n composing the piece he observes any interruptions occurred so that a considerable time elapsed between beginning and concluding it and in the mean while much within myself had changed the various alterations which during this period my way of thinking and feeling underwent naturally told upon the work i was engaged with what parts of it had at first attracted me began to produce this effect in a weaker degree and in the end scarcely at all new ideas springing up in the interim displaced the former ones carlos himself had lost my favour perhaps for no other reason than because i had become his senior and from the opposite cause posa had occupied his place thus i commenced the fourth and fifth acts with quite an altered heart but the first three were already in the hands of the public the plan of the whole could not now be reormed nothing therefore remained but to suppress the piece entirely or to fit the second half to the first the best way i could the imperfection alluded to is one of which the general reader will make no great account the second half is fitted to the first with address enough for his purposes intent not upon applying the dramatic gauge but on being moved and exalted we may peruse the tragedy without noticing that any such defect exists in it the pity and love we are first taught to feel for carlos abide with us to the last and though posa rises in importance as the piece proceeds our admiration of his transcendent virtues does not obstruct the gentler feelings with which we look upon the fate of his friend a certain confusion and crowding together of events about the end of the play is the only fault in its plan that strikes us with any force even this is scarcely prominent enough to be offensive an intrinsic and weightier defect is the want of ease and lightness in the general composition of the piece a defect which all its other excellencies will not prevent us from observing there is action enough in the plot energy enough in the dialogue and abundance of individual beauties in both but there is throughout a certain air of stiffness and effort which abstracts from the theatrical illusion the language in general impressive and magnificent is now and then inflated into bombast the characters do not as it were verify their human nature by those thousand little touches and nameless turns which distinguish the genius essentially dramatic from the genius merely poetical the proteus of the stage from the philosophic observer and trained imitator of life we have not those careless felicities those varyings from high to low that air of living freedom which shakspeare has accustomed us like spoiled children to look for in every perfect work of this species schiller is too elevated too regular and sustained in his elevation to be altogether natural yet with all this carlos is a noble tragedy there is a stately massiveness about the structure of it the incidents are grand and affecting the characters powerful vividly conceived and impressively if not completely delineated of wit and its kindred graces schiller has but a slender share nor among great poets is he much distinguished for depth or fineness of pathos but what gives him a place of his own and the loftiest of its kind is the vastness and intense vigour of his mind the splendour of his thoughts and imagery and the bold vehemence of his passion for the true and the sublime under all their various forms he does not thrill but he exalts us his genius is impetuous exuberant majestic and a heavenly fire gleams through all his creations he transports us into a holier and higher world than our own everything around us breathes of force and solemn beauty the looks of his heroes may be more staid than those of men the movements of their minds may be slower and more calculated but we yield to the potency of their endowments and the loveliness of the scene which they animate the enchantments of the poet are strong enough to silence our scepticism we forbear to inquire whether it is true or false the celebrity of alfieri generally invites the reader of don carlos to compare it with filippo both writers treat the same subject both borrow their materials from the same source the nouvelle historique of st r al but it is impossible that two powerful minds could have handled one given idea in more diverse manners their excellencies are in fact so opposite that they scarcely come in competition alfieri play is short and the characters are few he describes no scene his personages are not the king of spain and his courtiers but merely men their place of action is not the escurial or madrid but a vacant objectless platform anywhere in space in all this schiller has a manifest advantage he paints manners and opinions he sets before us a striking pageant which interests us of itself and gives a new interest to whatever is combined with it the principles of the antique or perhaps rather of the french drama upon which alfieri worked permitted no such delineation in the style there is the same diversity a severe simplicity uniformly marks alfieri style in his whole tragedy there is not a single figure a hard emphatic brevity is all that distinguishes his language from that of prose schiller we have seen abounds with noble metaphors and all the warm exciting eloquence of poetry it is only in expressing the character of philip that alfieri has a clear superiority without the aid of superstition which his rival especially in the catastrophe employs to such advantage alfieri has exhibited in his filippo a picture of unequalled power obscurity is justly said to be essential to terror and sublimity and schiller has enfeebled the effect of his tyrant by letting us behold the most secret recesses of his spirit we understand him better but we fear him less alfieri does not show us the internal combination of filippo it is from its workings alone that we judge of his nature mystery and the shadow of horrid cruelty brood over his filippo it is only a transient word or act that gives us here and there a glimpse of his fierce implacable tremendous soul a short and dubious glimmer that reveals to us the abysses of his being dark lurid and terrific s the throat of the infernal pool alfieri filippo is perhaps the most wicked man that human imagination has conceived alfieri and schiller were again unconscious competitors in the history of mary stuart but the works before us give a truer specimen of their comparative merits schiller seems to have the greater genius alfieri the more commanding character alfieri greatness rests on the stern concentration of fiery passion under the dominion of an adamantine will this was his own make of mind and he represents it with strokes in themselves devoid of charm but in their union terrible as a prophetic scroll schiller moral force is commensurate with his intellectual gifts and nothing more the mind of the one is like the ocean beautiful in its strength smiling in the radiance of summer and washing luxuriant and romantic shores that of the other is like some black unfathomable lake placed far amid the melancholy mountains bleak solitary desolate but girdled with grim skyiercing cliffs overshadowed with storms and illuminated only by the red glare of the lightning schiller is magnificent in his expansion alfieri is overpowering in his condensed energy the first inspires us with greater admiration the last with greater awe this tragedy of carlos was received with immediate and universal approbation in the closet and on the stage it excited the warmest applauses equally among the learned and unlearned schiller expectations had not been so high he knew both the excellencies and the faults of his work but he had not anticipated that the former would be recognised so instantaneously the pleasure of this new celebrity came upon him therefore heightened by surprise had dramatic eminence been his sole object he might now have slackened his exertions the public had already ranked him as the first of their writers in that favourite department but this limited ambition was not his moving principle nor was his mind of that sort for which rest is provided in this world the primary disposition of his nature urged him to perpetual toil the great aim of his life the unfolding of his mental powers was one of those which admit but a relative not an absolute progress new ideas of perfection arise as the former have been reached the student is always attaining never has attained schiller worldly circumstances too were of a kind well calculated to prevent excess of quietism he was still drifting at large on the tide of life he was crowned with laurels but without a home his heart warm and affectionate fitted to enjoy the domestic blessings which it longed for was allowed to form no permanent attachment he felt that he was unconnected solitary in the world cut off from the exercise of his kindlier sympathies or if tasting such pleasures it was natching them rather than partaking of them calmly the vulgar desire of wealth and station never entered his mind for an instant but as years were added to his age the delights of peace and continuous comfort were fast becoming more acceptable than any other and he looked with anxiety to have a restinglace amid his wanderings to be a man among his fellowen for all these wishes schiller saw that the only chance of fulfilment depended on unwearied perseverance in his literary occupations yet though his activity was unabated and the calls on it were increasing rather than diminished its direction was gradually changing the drama had long been stationary and of late been falling in his estimation the difficulties of the art as he viewed it at present had been overcome and new conquests invited him in other quarters the latter part of carlos he had written as a task rather than a pleasure he contemplated no farther undertaking connected with the stage for a time indeed he seems to have wavered among a multiplicity of enterprises now solicited to this and now to that without being able to fix decidedly on any the restless ardour of his mind is evinced by the number and variety of his attempts its fluctuation by the circumstance that all of them are either short in extent or left in the state of fragments of the former kind are his lyrical productions many of which were composed about this period during intervals from more serious labours the character of these performances is such as his former writings gave us reason to expect with a deep insight into life and a keen and comprehensive sympathy with its sorrows and enjoyments there is combined that impetuosity of feeling that pomp of thought and imagery which belong peculiarly to schiller if he had now left the drama it was clear that his mind was still overflowing with the elements of poetry dwelling among the grandest conceptions and the boldest or finest emotions thinking intensely and profoundly but decorating its thoughts with those graces which other faculties than the understanding are required to afford them with these smaller pieces schiller occupied himself at intervals of leisure throughout the remainder of his life some of them are to be classed among the most finished efforts of his genius the walk the song of the bell contain exquisite delineations of the fortunes and history of man his ritter toggenburg his cranes of ibycus his hero and leander are among the most poetical and moving ballads to be found in any language of these poems the most noted written about this time the freethinking of passion freigeisterei der leidenschaft is said to have originated in a real attachment the lady whom some biographers of schiller introduce to us by the mysterious designation of the r ulein a one of the first beauties in dresden seems to have made a deep impression on the heart of the poet they tell us that she sat for the picture of the princess eboli in his don carlos that he paid his court to her with the most impassioned fervour and the extreme of generosity they add one or two anecdotes of dubious authenticity which as they illustrate nothing but show us only that love could make schiller crazy as it is said to make all gods and men we shall use the freedom to omit this enchanting and not inexorable spinster perhaps displaced the mannheim laura from her throne but the gallant assiduities which she required or allowed seem not to have abated the zeal of her admirer in his more profitable undertakings her reign we suppose was brief and without abiding influence schiller never wrote or thought with greater diligence than while at dresden partially occupied with conducting his thalia or with those more slight poetical performances his mind was hovering among a multitude of weightier plans and seizing with avidity any hint that might assist in directing its attempts to this state of feeling we are probably indebted for the geisterseher a novel naturalised in our circulating libraries by the title of the ghostseer two volumes of which were published about this time the king of quacks the renowned cagliostro was now playing his dextrous game at paris harrowingp the souls of the curious and gullible of all ranks in that capital by various thaumaturgic feats raising the dead from their graves and what was more to the purpose raising himself from the station of a poor sicilian lacquey to that of a sumptuous and extravagant count the noise of his exploits appears to have given rise to this work of schiller it is an attempt to exemplify the process of hoodwinking an acute but too sensitive man of working on the latent germ of superstition which exists beneath his outward scepticism harassing his mind by the terrors of magic the magic of chemistry and natural philosophy and natural cunning till racked by doubts and agonising fears and plunging from one depth of dark uncertainty into another he is driven at length to still his scruples in the bosom of the infallible church the incidents are contrived with considerable address displaying a familiar acquaintance not only with several branches of science but also with some curious forms of life and human nature one or two characters are forcibly drawn particularly that of the amiable but feeble count the victim of the operation the strange foreigner with the visage of stone who conducts the business of mystification strikes us also though we see but little of him the work contains some vivid description some passages of deep tragical effect it has a vein of keen observation in general a certain rugged power which might excite regret that it was never finished but schiller found that his views had been mistaken it was thought that he meant only to electrify his readers by an accumulation of surprising horrors in a novel of the mrs radcliffe fashion he felt in consequence discouraged to proceed and finally abandoned it schiller was in fact growing tired of fictitious writing imagination was with him a strong not an exclusive perhaps not even a predominating faculty in the sublimest flights of his genius intellect is a quality as conspicuous as any other we are frequently not more delighted with the grandeur of the drapery in which he clothes his thoughts than with the grandeur of the thoughts themselves to a mind so restless the cultivation of all its powers was a peremptory want in one so earnest the love of truth was sure to be among its strongest passions even while revelling with unworn ardour in the dreamy scenes of the imagination he had often cast a longing look and sometimes made a hurried inroad into the calmer provinces of reason but the first effervescence of youth was past and now more than ever the love of contemplating or painting things as they should be began to yield to the love of knowing things as they are the tendency of his mind was gradually changing he was about to enter on a new field of enterprise where new triumphs awaited him for a time he had hesitated what to choose at length he began to think of history as a leading object of pursuit this promised him peculiar advantages it was new to him and fitted to employ some of his most valuable gifts it was grounded on reality for which as we have said his taste was now becoming stronger its mighty revolutions and events and the commanding characters that figure in it would likewise present him with things great and moving for which his taste had always been strong as recording the past transactions and indicating the prospects of nations it could not fail to be delightful to one for whom not only human nature was a matter of most fascinating speculation but who looked on all mankind with the sentiments of a brother feeling truly what he often said that e had no dearer wish than to see every living mortal happy and contented with his lot to all these advantages another of a humbler sort was added but which the nature of his situation forbade him to lose sight of the study of history while it afforded him a subject of continuous and regular exertion would also afford him what was even more essential the necessary competence of income for which he felt reluctant any longer to depend on the resources of poetry but which the produce of his pen was now the only means he had of realising for these reasons he decided on commencing the business of historian the composition of don carlos had already led him to investigate the state of spain under philip and being little satisfied with watson clear but shallow work on that reign he had turned to the original sources of information the writings of grotius strada de thou and many others investigating these with his usual fidelity and eagerness the revolt of the netherlands had by degrees become familiar to his thoughts distinct in many parts where it was previously obscure and attractive as it naturally must be to a temper such as his he now determined that his first historical performance should be a narrative of that event he resolved to explore the minutest circumstance of its rise and progress to arrange the materials he might collect in a more philosophical order to interweave with them the general opinions he had formed or was forming on many points of polity and national or individual character and if possible to animate the whole with that warm sympathy which in a lover of freedom this most glorious of her triumphs naturally called forth in the fillingp of such an outline there was scope enough for diligence but it was not in schiller nature to content himself with ordinary efforts no sooner did a project take hold of his mind than rallying round it all his accomplishments and capabilities he stretched it out into something so magnificent and comprehensive that little less than a lifetime would have been sufficient to effect it this history of the revolt of the netherlands which formed his chief study he looked upon but as one branch of the great subject he was yet destined to engage with history at large in all its bearings was now his final aim and his mind was continually occupied with plans for acquiring improving and diffusing the knowledge of it of these plans many never reached a describable shape very few reached even partial execution one of the latter sort was an intended history of the most remarkable conspiracies and revolutions in the middle and later ages a first volume of the work was published in schiller part in it was trifling scarcely more than that of a translator and editor st r al conspiracy of bedmar against venice here furnished with an extended introduction is the best piece in the book indeed st r al seems first to have set him on this task the abb had already signified his predilection for plots and revolutions and given a fine sample of his powers in treating such matters what schiller did was to expand this idea and communicate a systematic form to it his work might have been curious and valuable had it been completed but the pressure of other engagements the necessity of limiting his views to the netherlands prevented this for the present it was afterwards forgotten and never carried farther such were schiller occupations while at dresden their extent and variety are proof enough that idleness was not among his vices it was in truth the opposite extreme in which he erred he wrote and thought with an impetuosity beyond what nature always could endure his intolerance of interruptions first put him on the plan of studying by night an alluring but pernicious practice which began at dresden and was never afterwards forsaken his recreations breathed a similar spirit he loved to be much alone and strongly moved the banks of the elbe were the favourite resort of his mornings here wandering in solitude amid groves and lawns and green and beautiful places he abandoned his mind to delicious musings watched the fitful current of his thoughts as they came sweeping through his soul in their vague fantastic gorgeous forms pleased himself with the transient images of memory and hope or meditated on the cares and studies which had lately been employing and were again soon to employ him at times he might be seen floating on the river in a gondola feasting himself with the loveliness of earth and sky he delighted most to be there when tempests were abroad his unquiet spirit found a solace in the expression of his own unrest on the face of nature danger lent a charm to his situation he felt in harmony with the scene when the rack was sweeping stormfully across the heavens and the forests were sounding in the breeze and the river was rolling its chafed waters into wild eddying heaps yet before the darkness summoned him exclusively to his tasks schiller commonly devoted a portion of his day to the pleasures of society could he have found enjoyment in the flatteries of admiring hospitality his present fame would have procured them for him in abundance but these things were not to schiller taste his opinion of the leshlies of leipzig we have already seen he retained the same sentiments throughout all his life the idea of being what we call a lion is offensive enough to any man of not more than common vanity or less than common understanding it was doubly offensive to him his pride and his modesty alike forbade it the delicacy of his nature aggravated into shyness by his education and his habits rendered situations of display more than usually painful to him the digito pr tereuntium was a sort of celebration he was far from coveting in the circles of fashion he appeared unwillingly and seldom to advantage their glitter and parade were foreign to his disposition their strict ceremonial cramped the play of his mind hemmed in as by invisible fences among the intricate barriers of etiquette so feeble so inviolable he felt constrained and helpless alternately chagrined and indignant it was the giant among pigmies gulliver in lilliput tied down by a thousand packthreads but there were more congenial minds with whom he could associate more familiar scenes in which he found the pleasures he was seeking here schiller was himself frank unembarrassed pliant to the humour of the hour his conversation was delightful abounding at once in rare and simple charms besides the intellectual riches which it carried with it there was that flow of kindliness and unaffected good humour which can render dulness itself agreeable schiller had many friends in dresden who loved him as a man while they admired him as a writer their intercourse was of the kind he liked sober as well as free and mirthful it was the careless calm honest effusion of his feelings that he wanted not the noisy tumults and coarse delirium of dissipation for this under any of its forms he at no time showed the smallest relish a visit to weimar had long been one of schiller projects he now first accomplished it in saxony had been for ages the attica of germany and weimar had of late become its athens in this literary city schiller found what he expected sympathy and brotherhood with men of kindred minds to goethe he was not introduced but herder and wieland received him with a cordial welcome with the latter he soon formed a most friendly intimacy wieland the nestor of german letters was grown gray in the service schiller reverenced him as a father and he was treated by him as a son e shall have bright hours he said ieland is still young when he loves wieland had long edited the deutsche mercur in consequence of their connexion schiller now took part in contributing to that work some of his smaller poems one or two fragments of the history of the netherlands and the letters on don carlos first appeared here his own thalia still continued to come out at leipzig with these for his incidental employments with the belgian revolt for his chief study and the best society in germany for his leisure schiller felt no wish to leave weimar the place and what it held contented him so much that he thought of selecting it for his permanent abode ou know the men he writes f whom germany is proud a herder a wieland with their brethren and one wall now encloses me and them what excellencies are in weimar in this city at least in this territory i mean to settle for life and at length once more to get a country footnote doering says oethe was at this time absent in italy an error as will by and by appear so occupied and so intentioned he continued to reside at weimar some months after his arrival he received an invitation from his early patroness and kind protectress madam von wolzogen to come and visit her at bauerbach schiller went accordingly to this his ancient city of refuge he again found all the warm hospitality which he had of old experienced when its character could less be mistaken but his excursion thither produced more lasting effects than this at rudolstadt where he stayed for a time on occasion of this journey he met with a new friend it was here that he first saw the fr ulein lengefeld a lady whose attractions made him loth to leave rudolstadt and eager to return next year he did return he lived from may till november there or in the neighbourhood he was busy as usual and he visited the lengefeld family almost every day schiller views on marriage his longing for civic and domestic existence we already know o be united with a person he had said hat shares our sorrows and our joys that responds to our feelings that moulds herself so pliantly so closely to our humours reposing on her calm and warm affection to relax our spirit from a thousand distractions a thousand wild wishes and tumultuous passions to dream away all the bitterness of fortune in the bosom of domestic enjoyment this the true delight of life some years had elapsed since he expressed these sentiments which time had confirmed not weakened the presence of the fr ulein lengefeld awoke them into fresh activity he loved this lady the return of love with which she honoured him diffused a sunshine over all his troubled world and if the wish of being hers excited more impatient thoughts about the settlement of his condition it also gave him fresh strength to attain it he was full of occupation while in rudolstadt ardent serious but not unhappy his literary projects were proceeding as before and besides the enjoyment of virtuous love he had that of intercourse with many worthy and some kindred minds among these the chief in all respects was goethe it was during his present visit that schiller first met with this illustrious person concerning whom both by reading and report his expectations had been raised so high no two men both of exalted genius could be possessed of more different sorts of excellence than the two that were now brought together in a large company of their mutual friends the english reader may form some approximate conception of the contrast by figuring an interview between shakspeare and milton how gifted how diverse in their gifts the mind of the one plays calmly in its capricious and inimitable graces over all the provinces of human interest the other concentrates powers as vast but far less various on a few subjects the one is catholic the other is sectarian the first is endowed with an allomprehending spirit skilled as if by personal experience in all the modes of human passion and opinion therefore tolerant of all peaceful collected fighting for no class of men or principles rather looking on the world and the various battles waging in it with the quiet eye of one already reconciled to the futility of their issues but pouring over all the forms of manyoloured life the light of a deep and subtle intellect and the decorations of an overflowing fancy and allowing men and things of every shape and hue to have their own free scope in his conception as they have it in the world where providence has placed them the other is earnest devoted struggling with a thousand mighty projects of improvement feeling more intensely as he feels more narrowly rejecting vehemently choosing vehemently at war with the one half of things in love with the other half hence dissatisfied impetuous without internal rest and scarcely conceiving the possibility of such a state apart from the difference of their opinions and mental culture shakspeare and milton seem to have stood in some such relation as this to each other in regard to the primary structure of their minds so likewise in many points was it with goethe and schiller the external circumstances of the two were moreover such as to augment their several peculiarities goethe was in his thirtyinth year and had long since found his proper rank and settlement in life schiller was ten years younger and still without a fixed destiny on both of which accounts his fundamental scheme of thought the principles by which he judged and acted and maintained his individuality although they might be settled were less likely to be sobered and matured in these circumstances we can hardly wonder that on schiller part the first impression was not very pleasant goethe sat talking of italy and art and travelling and a thousand other subjects with that flow of brilliant and deep sense sarcastic humour knowledge fancy and good nature which is said to render him the best talker now alive schiller looked at him in quite a different mood he felt his natural constraint increased under the influence of a man so opposite in character so potent in resources so singular and so expert in using them a man whom he could not agree with and knew not how to contradict soon after their interview he thus writes n the whole this personal meeting has not at all diminished the idea great as it was which i had previously formed of goethe but i doubt whether we shall ever come into any close communication with each other much that still interests me has already had its epoch with him his whole nature is from its very origin otherwise constructed than mine his world is not my world our modes of conceiving things appear to be essentially different from such a combination no secure substantial intimacy can result time will try footnote the aid of time was not in fact unnecessary on the part of goethe there existed prepossessions no less hostile and derived from sources older and deeper than the present transitory meeting to the discontents of which they probably contributed he himself has lately stated them with his accustomed frankness and good humour in a paper part of which some readers may peruse with an interest more than merely biographical n my return from italy he says here i had been endeavouring to train myself to greater purity and precision in all departments of art not heeding what meanwhile was going on in germany i found here some older and some more recent works of poetry enjoying high esteem and wide circulation while unhappily their character to me was utterly offensive i shall only mention heinse ardinghello and schiller robbers the first i hated for its having undertaken to exhibit sensuality and mystical abstruseness ennobled and supported by creative art the last because in it the very paradoxes moral and dramatic from which i was struggling to get liberated had been laid hold of by a powerful though an immature genius and poured in a boundless rushing flood over all our country either of these gifted individuals did i blame for what he had performed or purposed it is the nature and the privilege of every mortal to attempt working in his own peculiar way he attempts it first without culture scarcely with the consciousness of what he is about and continues it with consciousness increasing as his culture increases whereby it happens that so many exquisite and so many paltry things are to be found circulating in the world and one perplexity is seen to rise from the ashes of another ut the rumour which these strange productions had excited over germany the approbation paid to them by every class of persons from the wild student to the polished courtady frightened me for i now thought all my labour was to prove in vain the objects and the way of handling them to which i had been exercising all my powers appeared as if defaced and set aside and what grieved me still more was that all the friends connected with me heinrich meyer and moritz as well as their fellowrtists tischbein and bury seemed in danger of the like contagion i was much hurt had it been possible i would have abandoned the study of creative art and the practice of poetry altogether for where was the prospect of surpassing those performances of genial worth and wild form in the qualities which recommended them conceive my situation it had been my object and my task to cherish and impart the purest exhibitions of poetic art and here was i hemmed in between ardinghello and franz von moor t happened also about this time that moritz returned from italy and stayed with me awhile during which he violently confirmed himself and me in these persuasions i avoided schiller who was now at weimar in my neighbourhood the appearance of don carlos was not calculated to approximate us the attempts of our common friends i resisted and thus we still continued to go on our way apart by degrees however both parties found that they had been mistaken the course of accidents brought many things to light which had been hidden the true character of each became unfolded more and more completely to the other and the cold measured tribute of respect was on both sides animated and exalted by feelings of kindness and ultimately of affection ere long schiller had by gratifying proofs discovered that his goethe was a very worthy man and goethe in his love of genius and zeal for the interests of literature was performing for schiller the essential duties of a friend even while his personal repugnance continued unabated a strict similarity of characters is not necessary or perhaps very favourable to friendship to render it complete each party must no doubt be competent to understand the other both must be possessed of dispositions kindred in their great lineaments but the pleasure of comparing our ideas and emotions is heightened when there is ikeness in unlikeness the same sentiments different opinions rousseau conceives to be the best material of friendship reciprocity of kind words and actions is more effectual than all luther loved melancthon johnson was not more the friend of edmund burke than of poor old dr levitt goethe and schiller met again as they ultimately came to live together and to see each other oftener they liked each other better they became associates friends and the harmony of their intercourse strengthened by many subsequent communities of object was never interrupted till death put an end to it goethe in his time has done many glorious things but few on which he should look back with greater pleasure than his treatment of schiller literary friendships are said to be precarious and of rare occurrence the rivalry of interest disturbs their continuance a rivalry greater where the subject of competition is one so vague impalpable and fluctuating as the favour of the public where the feeling to be gratified is one so nearly allied to vanity the most irritable arid and selfish feeling of the human heart had goethe prime motive been the love of fame he must have viewed with repugnance not the misdirection but the talents of the rising genius advancing with such rapid strides to dispute with him the palm of intellectual primacy nay as the million thought already in possession of it and if a sense of his own dignity had withheld him from offering obstructions or uttering any whisper of discontent there is none but a truly patrician spirit that would cordially have offered aid to being secretly hostile and openly indifferent the next resource was to enact the patron to solace vanity by helping the rival whom he could not hinder and who could do without his help goethe adopted neither of these plans it reflects much credit on him that he acted as he did eager to forward schiller views by exerting all the influence within his power he succeeded in effecting this and what was still more difficult in suffering the character of benefactor to merge in that of equal they became not friends only but fellowabourers a connection productive of important consequences in the history of both particularly of the younger and more undirected of the two meanwhile the history of the revolt of the united netherlands was in part before the world the first volume came out in schiller former writings had given proofs of powers so great and various such an extent of general intellectual strength and so deep an acquaintance both practical and scientific with the art of composition that in a subject like history no ordinary work was to be looked for from his hands with diligence in accumulating materials and patient care in elaborating them he could scarcely fail to attain distinguished excellence the present volume was well calculated to fulfil such expectations the revolt of the netherlands possesses all the common requisites of a good history and many which are in some degree peculiar to itself the information it conveys is minute and copious we have all the circumstances of the case remote and near set distinctly before us yet such is the skill of the arrangement these are at once briefly and impressively presented the work is not stretched out into a continuous narrative but gathered up into masses which are successively exhibited to view the minor facts being grouped around some leading one to which as to the central object our attention is chiefly directed this method of combining the details of events of proceeding as it were per saltum from eminence to eminence and thence surveying the surrounding scene is undoubtedly the most philosophical of any but few men are equal to the task of effecting it rightly it must be executed by a mind able to look on all its facts at once to disentangle their perplexities referring each to its proper head and to choose often with extreme address the station from which the reader is to view them without this or with this inadequately done a work on such a plan would be intolerable schiller has accomplished it in great perfection the whole scene of affairs was evidently clear before his own eye and he did not want expertness to discriminate and seize its distinctive features the bond of cause and consequence he never loses sight of and over each successive portion of his narrative he pours that flood of intellectual and imaginative brilliancy which all his prior writings had displayed his reflections expressed or implied are the fruit of strong comprehensive penetrating thought his descriptions are vivid his characters are studied with a keen sagacity and set before us in their most striking points of view those of egmont and orange occur to every reader as a rare union of perspicacity and eloquence the work has a look of order of beauty joined to calm reposing force had it been completed it might have ranked as the very best of schiller prose compositions but no second volume ever came to light and the first concludes at the entrance of alba into brussels two fragments alone the siege of antwerp and the passage of alba army both living pictures show us still farther what he might have done had he proceeded the surpassing and often highlyicturesque movements of this war the devotedness of the dutch their heroic achievement of liberty were not destined to be painted by the glowing pen of schiller whose heart and mind were alike so qualified to do them justice footnote if we mistake not madame de sta in her r volution fran aise had this performance of schiller in her eye her work is constructed on a similar though a rather looser plan of arrangement the execution of it bears the same relation to that of schiller it is less irregular more ambitious in its rhetoric inferior in precision though often not in force of thought and imagery the accession of reputation which this work procured its author was not the only or the principal advantage he derived from it eichhorn professor of history was at this time about to leave the university of jena goethe had already introduced his new acquaintance schiller to the special notice of amelia the accomplished regent of sachseneimar he now joined with voigt the head chaplain of the court in soliciting the vacant chair for him seconded by the general voice and the persuasion of the princess herself he succeeded schiller was appointed professor at jena he went thither in with schiller removal to jena begins a new epoch in his public and private life his connexion with goethe here first ripened into friendship and became secured and cemented by frequency of intercourse jena is but a few miles distant from weimar and the two friends both settled in public offices belonging to the same government had daily opportunities of interchanging visits schiller wanderings were now concluded with a heart tired of so fluctuating an existence but not despoiled of its capacity for relishing a calmer one with a mind experienced by much and varied intercourse with men full of knowledge and of plans to turn it to account he could now repose himself in the haven of domestic comforts and look forward to days of more unbroken exertion and more wholesome and permanent enjoyment than hitherto had fallen to his lot in the february following his settlement at jena he obtained the hand of fr ulein lengefeld a happiness with the prospect of which he had long associated all the pleasures which he hoped for from the future a few months after this event he thus expresses himself in writing to a friend ife is quite a different thing by the side of a beloved wife than so forsaken and alone even in summer beautiful nature i now for the first time fully enjoy it live in it the world again clothes itself around me in poetic forms old feelings are again awakening in my breast what a life i am leading here i look with a glad mind around me my heart finds a perennial contentment without it my spirit so fine so refreshing a nourishment my existence is settled in harmonious composure not strained and impassioned but peaceful and clear i look to my future destiny with a cheerful heart now when standing at the wishedor goal i wonder with myself how it all has happened so far beyond my expectations fate has conquered the difficulties for me it has i may say forced me to the mark from the future i expect everything a few years and i shall live in the full enjoyment of my spirit nay i think my very youth will be renewed an inward poetic life will give it me again footnote the obstacles to their union have already been described in the words of goethe the steps by which these were surmounted are described by him in the same paper with equal minuteness and effect it is interesting but cannot be inserted here see appendix i no to what extent these smiling hopes were realised will be seen in the next and concluding part of this biography part from his settlement at jena to his death part third the duties of his new office naturally called upon schiller to devote himself with double zeal to history a subject which from choice he had already entered on with so much eagerness in the study of it we have seen above how his strongest faculties and tastes were exercised and gratified and new opportunities were now combined with new motives for persisting in his efforts concerning the plan or the success of his academical prelections we have scarcely any notice in his class it is said he used most frequently to speak extempore and his delivery was not distinguished by fluency or grace a circumstance to be imputed to the agitation of a public appearance for as woltmann assures us he beauty the elegance ease and true instructiveness with which he could continuously express himself in private were acknowledged and admired by all his friends his matter we suppose would make amends for these deficiencies of manner to judge from his introductory lecture preserved in his works with the title what is universal history and with what views should it be studied there perhaps has never been in europe another course of history sketched out on principles so magnificent and philosophical but college exercises were far from being his ultimate object nor did he rest satisfied with mere visions of perfection the compass of the outline he had traced for a proper historian was scarcely greater than the assiduity with which he strove to fill it up his letters breathe a spirit not only of diligence but of ardour he seems intent with all his strength upon this fresh pursuit and delighted with the vast prospects of untouched and attractive speculation which were opening around him on every side he professed himself to be xceedingly contented with his business his ideas on the nature of it were acquiring both extension and distinctness and every moment of his leisure was employed in reducing them to practice he was now busied with the history of the thirtyears war footnote the paper entitled hints on the origin of human society as indicated in the mosaic records the mission of moses the laws of solon and lycurgus are pieces of the very highest order full of strength and beauty delicious to the lovers of that plastic philosophy which employs itself in giving form and life to the ry bones of those antique events that lie before us so inexplicable in the brief and enigmatic pages of their chroniclers the glance over europe at the period of the first crusade the times of the emperor frederick i the troubles in france are also masterly sketches in a simpler and more common style this work which appeared in is considered by the german critics as his chief performance in this department of literature the revolt of the netherlands the only one which could have vied with it never was completed otherwise in our opinion it might have been superior either of the two would have sufficed to secure for schiller a distinguished rank among historians of the class denominated philosophical though even both together they afford but a feeble exemplification of the ideas which he entertained on the manner of composing history in his view the business of history is not merely to record but to interpret it involves not only a clear conception and a lively exposition of events and characters but a sound enlightened theory of individual and national morality a general philosophy of human life whereby to judge of them and measure their effects the historian now stands on higher ground takes in a wider range than those that went before him he can now survey vast tracts of human action and deduce its laws from an experience extending over many climes and ages with his ideas moreover his feelings ought to be enlarged he should regard the interests not of any sect or state but of mankind the progress not of any class of arts or opinions but of universal happiness and refinement his narrative in short should be moulded according to the science and impregnated with the liberal spirit of his time voltaire is generally conceived to have invented and introduced a new method of composing history the chief historians that have followed him have been by way of eminence denominated philosophical this is hardly correct voltaire wrote history with greater talent but scarcely with a new species of talent he applied the ideas of the eighteenth century to the subject but in this there was nothing radically new in the hands of a thinking writer history has always been hilosophy teaching by experience that is such philosophy as the age of the historian has afforded for a greek or roman it was natural to look upon events with an eye to their effect on his own city or country and to try them by a code of principles in which the prosperity or extension of this formed a leading object for a monkish chronicler it was natural to estimate the progress of affairs by the number of abbeys founded the virtue of men by the sumotal of donations to the clergy and for a thinker of the present day it is equally natural to measure the occurrences of history by quite a different standard by their influence upon the general destiny of man their tendency to obstruct or to forward him in his advancement towards liberty knowledge true religion and dignity of mind each of these narrators simply measures by the scale which is considered for the time as expressing the great concerns and duties of humanity schiller views on this matter were as might have been expected of the most enlarged kind t seems to me said he in one of his letters hat in writing history for the moderns we should try to communicate to it such an interest as the history of the peloponnesian war had for the greeks now this is the problem to choose and arrange your materials so that to interest they shall not need the aid of decoration we moderns have a source of interest at our disposal which no greek or roman was acquainted with and which the patriotic interest does not nearly equal this last in general is chiefly of importance for unripe nations for the youth of the world but we may excite a very different sort of interest if we represent each remarkable occurrence that happened to men as of importance to man it is a poor and little aim to write for one nation a philosophic spirit cannot tolerate such limits cannot bound its views to a form of human nature so arbitrary fluctuating accidental the most powerful nation is but a fragment and thinking minds will not grow warm on its account except in so far as this nation or its fortunes have been influential on the progress of the species that there is not some excess in this comprehensive cosmopolitan philosophy may perhaps be liable to question nature herself has wisely no doubt partitioned us into indreds and nations and tongues it is among our instincts to grow warm in behalf of our country simply for its own sake and the business of reason seems to be to chasten and direct our instincts never to destroy them we require individuality in our attachments the sympathy which is expanded over all men will commonly be found so much attenuated by the process that it cannot be effective on any and as it is in nature so it is in art which ought to be the image of it universal philanthropy forms but a precarious and very powerless rule of conduct and the rogress of the species will turn out equally unfitted for deeply exciting the imagination it is not with freedom that we can sympathise but with free men there ought indeed to be in history a spirit superior to petty distinctions and vulgar partialities our particular affections ought to be enlightened and purified but they should not be abandoned or such is the condition of humanity our feelings must evaporate and fade away in that extreme diffusion perhaps in a certain sense the surest mode of pleasing and instructing all nations is to write for one this too schiller was aware of and had in part attended to besides the thirtyears war is a subject in which nationality of feeling may be even wholly spared better than in almost any other it is not a german but a european subject it forms the concluding portion of the reformation and this is an event belonging not to any country in particular but to the human race yet if we mistake not this overendency to generalisation both in thought and sentiment has rather hurt the present work the philosophy with which it is embued now and then grows vague from its abstractness ineffectual from its refinement the enthusiasm which pervades it elevated strong enlightened would have told better on our hearts had it been confined within a narrower space and directed to a more specific class of objects in his extreme attention to the philosophical aspects of the period schiller has neglected to take advantage of many interesting circumstances which it offered under other points of view the thirtyears war abounds with what may be called picturesqueness in its events and still more in the condition of the people who carried it on harte history of gustavus a wilderness which mere human patience seems unable to explore is yet enlivened here and there with a cheerful spot when he tells us of some scalade or camisado or speculates on troopers rendered bulletroof by artagic his chaotic records have in fact afforded to our novelist the raw materials of dugald dalgetty a cavalier of the most singular equipment of character and manners which for many reasons merit study and description to much of this though as he afterwards proved it was well known to him schiller paid comparatively small attention his work has lost in liveliness by the omission more than it has gained in dignity or instructiveness yet with all its imperfections this is no ordinary history the speculation it is true is not always of the kind we wish it excludes more moving or enlivening topics and sometimes savours of the inexperienced theorist who had passed his days remote from practical statesmen the subject has not sufficient unity in spite of every effort it breaks into fragments towards the conclusion but still there is an energy a vigorous beauty in the work which far more than redeems its failings great thoughts at every turn arrest our attention and make us pause to confirm or contradict them happy metaphors some vivid descriptions of events and men remind us of the author of fiesco and don carlos the characters of gustavus and wallenstein are finely developed in the course of the narrative tilly passage of the lech the battles of leipzig and tzen figure in our recollection as if our eyes had witnessed them the death of gustavus is described in terms which might draw ron tears from the eyes of veterans if schiller had inclined to dwell upon the mere visual or imaginative department of his subject no man could have painted it more graphically or better called forth our emotions sympathetic or romantic but this we have seen was not by any means his leading aim footnote yet we scarcely meet with one so happy as that in the revolt of the netherlands where he finishes his picture of the gloomy silence and dismay that reigned in brussels on the first entrance of alba by this striking simile ow that the city had received the spanish general within its walls it had the air as of a man that has drunk a cup of poison and with shuddering expectation watches every moment for its deadly agency footnote see appendix i no on the whole the present work is still the best historical performance which germany can boast of histories are distinguished by merits of another sort by condensing in a given space and frequently in lucid order a quantity of information copious and authentic beyond example but as intellectual productions they cannot rank with schiller woltmann of berlin has added to the thirtyears war another work of equal size by way of continuation entitled history of the peace of munster with the first negotiations of which treaty the former concludes woltmann is a person of ability but we dare not say of him what wieland said of schiller that by his first historical attempt he as discovered a decided capability of rising to a level with hume robertson and gibbon he will rather rise to a level with belsham or smollett this first complete specimen of schiller art in the historical department though but a small fraction of what he meant to do and could have done proved in fact to be the last he ever undertook at present very different cares awaited him in a fit of sickness overtook him he had to exchange the inspiring labours of literature for the disgusts and disquietudes of physical disease his disorder which had its seat in the chest was violent and threatening and though nature overcame it in the present instance the blessing of entire health never more returned to him the cause of this severe affliction seemed to be the unceasing toil and anxiety of mind in which his days had hitherto been passed his frame which though tall had never been robust was too weak for the vehement and sleepless soul that dwelt within it and the habit of nocturnal study had no doubt aggravated all the other mischiefs ever since his residence at dresden his constitution had been weakened but this rude shock at once shattered its remaining strength for a time the strictest precautions were required barely to preserve existence a total cessation from every intellectual effort was one of the most peremptory laws prescribed to him schiller habits and domestic circumstances equally
