some excuse seems to be needed for venturing at this time to publish biographical sketches of the men of the victorian era several have been written by men like lord morley and lord bryce having firstand knowledge of their subjects others by the best critics of the next generation such as mr chesterton and mr cluttonrock with their critical ability i am not able to compete but they often postulate a knowledge of facts which the average reader has forgotten or has never known having written these sketches primarily for boys at school i am not ashamed to state wellnown facts nor have i wished to avoid the obvious nor do these sketches aim at obtaining a sensation by the shattering of idols i have been content to accept the verdicts passed by their contemporaries on these great servants of the public verdicts which in general seem likely to stand the test of time boys will come soon enough on books where criticism has fuller play and revise the judgements of the past such a revision is salutary when it is not unfair or bitter in tone at a time when the subject called ivics is being more widely introduced into schools it seems useful to present the facts of individual lives instances chosen from different professions as a supplement to the study of principles and institutions there is a spirit of public service which is best interpreted through concrete examples if teachers will from their own knowledge fill in these outlines and give life to these portraits the younger generation may find it not uninteresting to raise famous men and our fathers that begat us it seems hardly necessary in a book of this kind to give an imposing list of authorities consulted in some cases i should find it difficult to trace the essay or memoir from which a statement is drawn but in the main i have depended on the standard lives of the various men portrayed from froude carlyle and forster dickens to mackail morris and michell rhodes and needless to say i have found the dictionary of national biography most valuable if boys were not frightened from the shelves by its bulk it would render my work superfluous but though i often recommend it to them i find few signs that they consult it as often as they should it may seem that no due proportion has been observed in the length of the different sketches but it must be remembered that while short lives of napier and lawrence have been written by wellnown authors it is more difficult for a boy to satisfy his curiosity about lister patteson or green and of morier no complete life has yet been published i am indebted to mr emery walker for assistance in the selection of the portraits three of my friends have been kind enough to read parts of the book and to give me advice the rev a t p williams and mr e robinson my colleagues here and mr nowell smith head master of sherborne i owe much also to the good judgement of mr milford reader if i venture to thank them for their help they are in no way responsible for my mistakes writing in the intervals of schoolastering i have no doubt been guilty of many and i shall be grateful if any reader will take the trouble to inform me of those which he

era we like to fancy when critics are not at our elbow that each age in our history has a character and a physiognomy of its own the sixteenth century speaks to us of change and adventure in every form of ships and statecraft of discovery and desecration of masterful sovereigns and unscrupulous ministers we evoke the memory of henry and elizabeth of wolsey and thomas cromwell of drake and raleigh while the gentler virtues of thomas more and philip sidney seem but rare flowers by the wayside the glory of the seventeenth century shines out amid the clash of arms in battles fought for noble principles in the lives and deaths of falkland and hampden of blake montrose and cromwell if its nobility is dimmed as we pass from the world of shakespeare and milton to that of dryden and defoe yet there is sufficient unity in its central theme to justify the enthusiasm of those who praise it as the heroic age of english history less justice perhaps is done when we characterize the eighteenth century as that of elegance and wit when heedless of the great names of chatham wolfe and clive we fill the forefront of our picture with clubs and coffeeouses with the graces of chesterfield and horace walpole the beauties of gainsborough and romney or the masterpieces of sheraton and adam but each generalization as we make it seems more imperfect and unfair and partly because carlyle abused it so unmercifully this century has in the last fifty years received ample justice from many of our ablest writers difficult indeed then it must seem to give adequate expression to the life of a century like the nineteenth so swift so restless so manyided so full of familiar personages and of conflicts which have hardly yet receded to a distance where the historian can judge them aright the rich luxuriance of movements and of individual characters chokes our path it is a labyrinth in which one may well lose one way and fail to see the wood for the trees the scientist would be protesting all this tim that this is a very superficial aspect of the matter he would recast our framework for us and teach us to follow out the course of our history through the development of mathematics physics and biology to pass from newton to harvey and from watt to darwin and in the relation of these sciences to one another to find the clue to man steady progress the tale thus told is indeed wonderful to read and worthy of the telling but to appreciate it fully it needs a wider and deeper knowledge than many possess and it tends to leave out one side of our human nature there are many whose sympathies will always be drawn rather to the influence of man upon man than to the extension of man power over nature to the development of character rather than of knowledge toay literature must approach science her allowerful sister with humility and crave indulgence for those who still wish to follow in the track where plutarch led the way to read of human infirmity as well as of human power not to scorn anecdotes or even comparisons which illustrate the qualities by which service can be rendered to the state to return to the nineteenth century some would find a guiding thread in the progress of the utilitarian school which based its teaching on the idea of pursuing the greatest happiness of the greatest number the school which produced philosophers like bentham and j s mill and politicians like cobden and morley it was congenial to the english mind to follow a line which seemed to lead with certainty to practical results and the industrial revolutions caused men at this time to look perhaps too much to the material conditions of welleing along with the discoveries that revolutionized industry the eighteenth century had bequeathed something more precious than material wealth john wesley the strongest personal influence of its latter half had stirred the spirit of conscious philanthropy and the desire to apply christian principles to the service of all mankind howard wilberforce and others directed this spirit into definite channels and many of their followers tinged with a warm religious glow the principles which even in agnostics like mill lent consistent nobility to a life of service the efforts which these men made alone or banded into societies to enlarge the liberties of englishmen and to distribute more fairly the good things of life among them were productive of much benefit to the age under such leadership indeed as that of bentham and wilberforce the victorian age might have been expected to follow a steady course of beneficence which would have drawn all the nobler spirits of the new generation into its main current clear logical and persuasive the utilitarians seemed likely to command success in parliament in the pulpit and in the press but the criterion of happiness however widely diffused and that it had not gone far in disraeli sybil will attes was not enough to satisfy the ardent idealism that blazed in the breasts of men stirred by revolutions and the new birth of christian zeal in contrast to the ordered pursuit of reform the spirit of which the utilitarians hoped to embody in societies and acts of parliament were the rebellious impulses of men filled with a prophetic spirit walking in obedience to an inward voice eager to cry aloud their message to a generation wrapped in prosperity and selfontentment they formed no single school and followed no single line in a few cases we may observe the relation of master and pupil as between carlyle and ruskin in more we can see a small band of friends like the preaphaelite brotherhood the leaders of the oxford movement or the scientific circle of darwin and hooker working in fellowship for a common end but individuality is their note they sprang often from surroundings most alien to their genius they wandered far from the courses which their birth seemed to prescribe the spirit caught them and they went forth to the fray the time in which they grew up was calculated to mould characters of strength selfontrol and selfenial had been needed in the protracted wars with france selfeliance had been learnt in the hard school of adversity imagination was quickened by the heroism of the struggle which had ended in the final victory of our arms and to the generations born in the early days of the nineteenth century lay open fields wider than were offered to human activity in any other age of the world history now at last the full fruits of sixteenthentury discovery were to be reaped it was possible for gordon by the personal ascendancy which he owed to his singleinded faith to create legends and to work miracles in asia and in africa for richard burton to gain an intimate knowledge of islam in its holiest shrines for livingstone hannington and other martyrs to the faith to breathe their last in the tropics for franklin dying as scott died nearly seventy years later in the cause of science to hallow the polar regions for the angloaxon race darkest africa was to remain impenetrable yet awhile only towards the end of the century when stanley work was finished could rhodes and kitchener conspire to clasp hands across its deserts and its swamps but on the other side of the globe a new islandmpire had been already created by the energy of wakefield and developed by the wisdom of parkes and grey in distant lands on stricken fields less famous but no less perilous wellington men were applying the lessons which they had learnt in the peninsula on distant seas nelson ships were carrying explorers equipped for the more peaceful task of scientific observation in this century the highest mountains the deepest seas the widest stretches of desert were to reveal their secrets to the adventurers who held the whole world for their playground or field of conquest and not only in the great expansion of empire abroad but in the growth of knowledge at home and the application of it to civil life there was a field to employ all the vigour of a race capable of rising to its opportunities there is no need to remind this generation of such names as stephenson and herschel darwin and huxley faraday and kelvin they are in no danger of being forgotten toay the men of letters take relatively a less conspicuous place in the evolution of the age but the force which they put into their writings the wealth of their material the variety of their lives and the contrasts of their work endow the annals of the nineteenth century with an absorbing interest while tennyson for the most part stayed in his english homes singing the beauties of his native land browning was a sojourner in italian palaces and villas studying men of many races and many times exploring the subtleties of the human heart the pen of dickens portrayed all classes of society except perhaps that which thackeray made his peculiar field the historians too furnish singular contrasts the vehement pugnacity of freeman is a foil to the serene studiousness of acton the erratic career of froude to the concentration of stubbs the influence exercised on their contemporaries by recluses such as newman or darwin may be compared with the more worldly activities of huxley and samuel wilberforce often we see equally diverse elements in following the course of a single life in matthew arnold we wonder at the poet of he strayed reveller coexisting with the zealous inspector of schools in william morris we find it hard to reconcile the creative craftsman with the fervent apostle of social discontent perhaps the most notable case of this diversity is the long pilgrimage of gladstone which led him from the camp of the tern unbending tories to the leadership of radicals and home rulers there is an interest in tracing through these metamorphoses the essential unity of a man character on the other hand one cannot but admire the steadfastness with which darwin and lister tennyson and watts pursued the even tenor of their way again we may notice the strange irony of fortune which drew carlyle from his native moorlands to spend fifty years in a london suburb while his disciple ruskin born and bred in london and finding fit audience in the universities of the south closed his long life in seclusion amid the cumbrian fells so two statesmen who were at one time very closely allied present a similarly striking contrast in the manner of their lives till the age of forty joseph chamberlain limited himself to municipal work in birmingham and yet he rose in later life to imperial views wider than any statesman of his day charles dilke on the other hand could be an expert on reater britain at thirty and yet devote his old age to elaborating the details of local government and framing programmes of social reform for the working classes of our towns accidents these may be but they lend to victorian biography the charm of a fanciful arabesque or mosaic of varied pattern and hue eccentrics too there were in fact among the literary men of the day even as there are in the fiction of dickens of peacock of george meredith there was borrow who as an old man was tramping solitarily in the fields of norfolk as earlier he wandered alone in wild wales or wilder spain there was fitzgerald who remained all his life constant to one corner of east anglia and who yet by the precious thread of his correspondence maintained contact with the great world of victorian letters to which he belonged some wandered as far afield as asia or the south seas some buried themselves in the secluded courts of oxford and cambridge and became mythical figures in academic lore not many were to be found within hail of london or edinburgh in these forceful days brougham the most omniscient of reviewers with the most illalanced of minds belongs more properly to the preceding age though he lived to and it is from this age that the novelists probably drew their eccentric types but between eccentricity and vigorous originality who shall draw the dividing line men like these it is hard to label and to classify their individuality is so patent that any general statement is at once open to attack the most that we can do is to indicate one or two points in which the true victorians had a certain resemblance to one another and were unlike their successors of our own day they were more evidently in earnest less conscious of themselves more indifferent to ridicule more absorbed in their work to many of them full work and the cares of office seemed a necessity of life it was a typical victorian who after sixteen years of public service writing a family letter says feel that the interest of business and the excitement of responsibility are indispensable to me and i believe that i am never happier than when i have more to think of and to do than i can manage in a given period idleness and insouciance had few temptations for them cynicism was abhorrent to them even thackeray was perpetually aught out when he assumed the cynic pose charlotte bront most loyal of his admirers and critics speaks of the feelings for his kind which he cherished in his large heart and again of the entiment jealously hidden but genuine which extracts the venom from that formidable thackeray largeearted and generous to one another they were ready to face adventure eager to fight for an ideal however impracticable it seemed this was as true of tennyson browning matthew arnold and all the genus irritabile vatum as of the politicians and the men of action they made many mistakes they were combative often difficult to deal with some of them were deficient in judgement others in the saving gift of humour but they were rarely petty or ungenerous or failed from fainteartedness or indecision vehemence and impatience can do harm to the best causes and the lives of men like the napiers and the lawrences like thomas arnold and charles kingsley like john bright and robert lowe are marred by conflicts which might have been avoided by more studied gentleness or more philosophic calm but the time seemed short in which they could redress the evils which offended them they saw around them a world which seemed to be lapped in comfort or swathed in the dead wrappings of the past and would not listen to reasoned appeals and it would be futile to deny that by lifting their voices to a pitch which offends fastidious critics carlyle and ruskin did sometimes obtain a hearing and kindle a passion which matthew arnold could never stir by his scholarly exhortations to weetness and light but it would be a mistake to infer from such clamour and contention that the victorians did not enjoy their fair share of happiness in this world the opposite would be nearer the truth happiness was given to them in good even in overflowing measure any one familiar with trevelyan biography of macaulay will remember with what fullness and intensity he enjoyed his life and the same fact is noted by dr mozley in his essay on that most representative victorian thomas arnold the lives of delane the famous editor of the times of the statesman palmerston of the painter millais and of many other men in many professions might be quoted to support this view in some cases this was due to their strong family affections in others to their genius for friendship a good conscience a good temper a good digestion are all factors of importance but perhaps the best insurance against moodiness and melancholy was that strenuous activity which made them forget themselves that energetic willower which was the driving force in so many movements of the day how many of the changes of last century were due to general tendencies how far the single will of this man or that has seriously affected its history it is impossible to estimate to many it seems that the r le of the individual is played out the spirit of the coming era is that of organized fellowship and associated effort the state is to prescribe for all and the units are somehow to be marshalled into their places by a higher collective will under the shadow of socialism the more ambitious may be tempted to quit the field of public service at home and to look to enterprises abroad o resign poor england to a mechanical bureaucracy a soulless uniformity where one man is as good as another but it is difficult to believe that society can dispense with leaders or afford to forget the lessons which may be learnt from the study of such noble lives the victorians had a robuster faith their faith and their achievements may help to banish such doubts toay as one of the few survivors of that victorian era has lately said nly those whose minds are numbed by the suspicion that all times are tolerably alike and men and women much of a muchness will deny that it was a generation of intrepid efforts forward some fell in midombat some survived to witness the eventual victory of their cause for all might be claimed the funeral honours which browning claimed for his grammarian they aimed high they hrew themselves on god the mountainops are their appropriate restinglace thomas carlyle born at ecclefechan dumfriesshire december enters

loses the use of his right hand refuses offer of baronetcy or g b death at chelsea february burial at ecclefechan thomas carlyle prophet northest of carlisle from which town the carlyle family in all probability first took their nam a little way along the border the river annan comes down its green valley from the lowland hills to lose itself in the wide sands of the solway firth at the foot of these hills is the village of ecclefechan some eight miles inland here in the wide irregular street down the side of which flows a little beck stands the grey cottage built by the stonemason james carlyle where he lived with his second wife margaret aitken and here on december the eldest of nine children their son thomas was born there is little to redeem the place from insignificance the houses are mostly mean the position of the village is tame and commonplace but if a visitor will mount the hills that lie to the north turn southward and look over the wide expanse of land and water to the cumbrian mountains then should he be fortunate enough to see the landscape in stormy and unsettled weather he may realize why the land was so dear to its most famous son that he could return to it from year to year throughout his life and could there at all times soothe his most unquiet moods through all his years in london he remained a lowland scot and was most at home in annandale with this district his fame is still bound up as that of walter scott with the tweed or that of wordsworth with the lakes in this humble household thomas carlyle first learnt what is meant by work by truthfulness and by reverence lessons which he never forgot he learnt to revere authority to revere worth and to revere something yet higher and more mysterious he unseen in sartor resartus he describes how his hero was impressed by his parents observance of religious duties he highest whom i knew on earth i here saw bowed down with awe unspeakable before a higher in heaven such things especially in infancy reach inwards to the very core of your being his father was a man of unusual force of character and gifted with a wonderful power of speech flashing out in picturesque metaphor in biting satire in humorous comment upon life he had too the scotch genius for valuing education and it was he who decided that tom whose character he had observed should have every chance that schooling could give him his mother was a most affectionate singleearted and religious woman labouring for her family content with her lot her trust for her son unfailing her only fear for him lest in his new learning he might fall away from the old biblical faith which she held so firmly herself reading with his father or mother lending a hand at housework when needed nourishing himself on the simple oatmeal and milk which throughout life remained his favourite food submitting himself instinctively to the stern discipline of the home he passed happily on the whole through his childhood and soon outstripped his comrades in the village school his success there led to his going in his tenth year to the grammar school at annan and before he reached his fourteenth year he trudged off on foot to edinburgh to begin his studies at the university instead of young men caught up by express trains and deposited by the aid of cabmen and porters in a few hours in the sheltered courts of oxford and cambridge we must imagine a party of boys of fourteen or fifteen years old trudging on foot twenty miles a day for five days across bleak country sleeping at rough inns and on their arrival searching for an attic in some bleak tenement in a noisy street here they were to live almost entirely on the baskets of home produce sent through the carriers at intervals by their thrifty parents it was and is a spartan discipline and it turns out men who have shown their grit and independence in all lands where the british flag is flown the earliest successes which carlyle won both at annan and at edinburgh were in mathematics his classical studies received little help from his professors and his literary gifts were developed mostly by his own reading and stimulated from time to time by talks with fellow students perhaps it was for his ultimate good that he was not brought under influences which might have guided him into more methodical courses and tamed his rugged originality the universities cannot often be proved to have fostered kindly their poets and original men of letters at least we may say that edinburgh was a more kindly alma mater to carlyle than oxford and cambridge proved to shelley and byron his native genius and the qualities which he inherited from his parents were not starved in alien soil but put out vigorous growth from such letters to his friends as have survived we can see what a power carlyle had already developed of forcibly expressing his ideas and establishing an influence over others he left the university at the age of nineteen and the next twelve years of his life were of a most unsettled character he made nearly as many false starts in life as goldsmith or coleridge though he redeemed them nobly by his persistence in after years in his family still regarded the ministry as his vocation and carlyle was himself quite undecided about it to promote this idea the profession of schoolmaster was taken up for the time he continued in it for more than six years first at annan and then at kirkcaldy but he was soon finding it uncongenial and rebelling against it a few years later he tried reading law with no greater contentment and in order to support himself he was reduced to teaching private pupils the chief friend of this period was edward irving the gifted preacher who afterwards in london came to tragic shipwreck he was a native of annan five years older than carlyle and he had spent some time in preaching and preparing for the ministry he was one of the few people who profoundly influenced carlyle life at kirkcaldy he was his constant companion shared his tastes lent him books and kindled his powers of insight and judgement in many a country walk carlyle has left us records of this time in his reminiscences how he read the twelve volumes of irving gibbon in twelve days how he tramped through the trossachs on foot how in summer twilights he paced the long stretches of sand at irving side it was irving who in commended him to the buller family with whom he continued as tutor for two years charles buller the eldest son was a boy of rare gifts and promise worthy of such a teacher and but for his untimely death in he might have won a foremost place in politics the family proved valuable friends to carlyle in afterife besides enabling him at this time to live in comfort with leisure for his own studies and some spare money to help his family but for this aid his brother alexander would have fared ill with the farming and john could never have afforded the training for the medical profession again it was irving who first took him to haddington in and introduced him to jane baillie welsh his future wife irving sincerity and sympathy his earnest enthusiasm joined with the power of genuine laughter always to carlyle a mark of a true rich natur made him through all these years a thoroughly congenial companion he really understood carlyle as few outside his family did and he never grew impatient at carlyle difficulty in settling to a profession our mind he wrote nfortunately for its present peace has taken in so wide a range of study as to be almost incapable of professional trammels and it has nourished so uncommon and so unyielding a character as first unfits you for and then disgusts you with any accommodations which for so cultivated and so fertile a mind would easily procure favour and patronage well might carlyle in later days find a hero in tough old samuel johnson whose sufferings were due to similar causes the other source which kept the fire in him aglow through these difficult years was the confidence and affection of his whole family and the welcome which he always found at home disappointed though they were at his failure as yet to settle to a profession and to earn a steady income for all that om was to be a great man and when he could find time to spend some months at mainhill or later at scotsbrig a room could always be found for him hours of peace and solitude could be enjoyed the most wholesome food and the most cordial affection were there rendered as loyal ungrudging tribute but new ties were soon to be knit and a new chapter to be opened in his life note farms near ecclefechan to which his parents moved in and john welsh of haddington who died before carlyle met his future wife was a surgeon and a man of remarkable gifts and his daughter could trace her descent to such famous scotsmen as wallace and john knox her own mental powers were great and her vivacity and charming manners caused her to shine in society wherever she was she had an unquestioned supremacy among the ladies of haddington and many had been the suitors for her hand when irving had given her lessons there love had sprung up between tutor and pupil but this budding romance ended tragically in before meeting her he had been engaged to another lady and when a new appointment gave him a sure income he was held to his bond and was forced to crush down his passion and to take farewell of miss welsh at what date carlyle conceived the hope of making her his wife it is difficult to say her beauty and wit seem to have done their work quickly in his case but she was not one to give her affections readily for all the intellectual sympathy which united them in she was contemplating marriage but had made no promise in she had accepted the idea of marrying him but in she still scouted the conditions in which he proposed to live his position was precarious his projects visionary and his immediate desire was to settle on a lonely farm where he could devote himself to study if she would do the household drudgery because his mother whom he loved and honoured was content to lead this life he seemed to think that his wife could do the same but her nature and her rearing were not those of the carlyles and their annandale neighbours it involved a complete renunciation of the comforts of life and the social position which she enjoyed and much though she admired his talents and enjoyed his company she was not in that passion of love which could lift her to such heights of selfacrifice by this time we can begin to discern in his letters the outline of his character is passionate absorption in study his moodiness his fits of despondency his intense irritability his incapacity to master his own tongue and temper in happy moments he shows great tenderness of feeling for those whom he loves or pities but this alternates with inconsiderate clamour and loud complaints deafening the ears of all about him provoked often by slight and even imaginary grievances it is the artistic nature run riot and that in one who preached silence and stoicism as the chief virtues n inconsistency which has amused and disgusted generations of readers it was impossible for him to do his work with the regular method the equable temper of a southey or a scott in dealing with history he must image the past to himself most vividly before he could expound his subject and that effort and strain cost him sleepless nights and days of concentrated thought nor was he an easier companion when his work was finished and he could take his ease then life seemed empty and profitless and in its emptiness his voice echoed all the louder the ill was within him and outward circumstances were powerless to affect his nature at this time he was chiefly occupied in reading german literature and spreading the knowledge of it among his countrymen after coleridge he was the first of our literary men to appreciate the poets and mystics of germany and he did more even than coleridge to make englishmen familiar with them he acquired at this time a knowledge of french and italian literature too but the philosophy of kant and the writings of goethe and schiller roused him to greater enthusiasm from kant he learnt that the guiding principle of conduct was not happiness but the ategorical imperative of duty from goethe he drew such hopefulness as gleams occasionally through his despondent utterances on the progress of the human race he translated goethe novel wilhelm meister in and followed it up with the life of schiller there was no considerable sale for either of these books till his lectures in london and his established fame roused a demand for all he had written in these days he was practising for the profession of a man of letters and was largely influenced by personal ambition and the desire to earn an income which would make him independent he was not yet fired with a mission or kindled to white heat his long courtship was rewarded in october when the marriage took place the bride was twentyive years old and the bridegroom thirty men of letters have not the reputation of making ideal husbands and the qualities to which this is due were possessed by carlyle in exaggerated measure it was a perilous enterprise for any one to live with him most of all for such a woman delicately bred nervous and highly strung she was aware of this and was prepared for a large measure of selfenial but she could not have foreseen how severe she would find the trial the morbid sensitiveness of carlyle to his own pains and troubles so often imaginary joined with his inconsiderate blindness to his wife real sufferings led to many hearturnings if she contributed to them in some degree by her wilfulness jealous temper and sharpness of tongue illealth and solitude may well excuse her his own confessions made after her death are coloured by sorrow and deep affection no doubt he paints his own conduct in hues darker than the truth demands shallow critics have sneered at the picture of the philosopher whose life was so much at variance with his creed and too much has perhaps been written about the subject if reference must be made to such a wellorn tale it is best to let carlyle own account stand as he wished it to stand his moral worth has been vindicated in a hundred ways not least by his humility and honesty about himself and can bear the test of time for the first two years of married life carlyle scheme of living on a farm was kept at bay by his wife and their home was at edinburgh carlyle refers to this as the happiest period of his life though he did not refrain from loud laments upon occasions the good genius of the household was jeffrey the famous editor of the edinburgh review who was distantly related to mrs carlyle he made friends with the newlyarried pair opened a path for them into the society of the capital and enabled carlyle to spread the knowledge of german authors in the review and to make his bow before a wider public the prospects of the little household seemed brighter but by generously making over all her money to her mother his wife had crippled its resources and carlyle was of so difficult a humour that neither jeffrey nor any one else could guide his steps for long living was precarious society made demands even on a modest household and in he at length had his way and persuaded his wife to remove to craigenputtock it was in the loneliness of the moors that carlyle was to come to his full stature and to develop his astonishing genius craigenputtock was a farm belonging to his wife family lying seventy feet above the sea sixteen miles from dumfries among desolate moors and bogs and fully six miles from the nearest village he house is gaunt and hungryooking it stands with the scanty fields attached as an island in a sea of morass the landscape is unredeemed either by grace or grandeur mere undulating hills of grass and heather with peat bogs in the hollows between them so froude describes the home where the carlyles were to spend six years the wife in domestic labours in solitude in growing illealth the husband in omnivorous reading in digesting the knowledge that he gathered in transmuting it and marking it with the peculiar stamp of his genius there was no true companionship over the work as the moorland gave the fresh air and stillness required so the wife might nourish the physical frame with wholesome digestible food and save him from external cares the rest must be done by lonely communing with himself he needed no fleet street taverns or literary salons to encourage him goethe with whom he exchanged letters and compliments at times said with rare insight that he ad in himself an originating principle of conviction out of which he could develop the force that lay in him unassisted by other men few were the interruptions from without his fame was not yet established in any case pilgrims would have to undertake a very rough journey and the fashion of such pilgrimages had hardly begun but in from distant america came one disciple afterwards to be known as the famous author ralph waldo emerson and he has left us in his english traits a vivid record of his impression of two or three famous men of letters whom he saw he describes carlyle as all and gaunt with a cliffike brow selfossessed and holding his extraordinary powers of conversation in easy command clinging to his northern accent with evident relish full of lively anecdote and with a streaming humour which floated everything he looked upon note emerson english traits orld classics edition p much of his time was given to reading about the french revolution which was to be the subject of his greatest literary triumph but the characteristic work of this period is sartor resartus he tailor patched anew in which carlyle under a thin german disguise reveals himself to the world with his views on the customs and ways of society and his contempt for all the pretensions and absurdities which they involved in many places it is extravagant and fantastic as when he most remarkable incident in modern history proves to be george fox the quaker making a suit of leather to render himself independent of tailors in others it rises to the highest pitch of poetry as in the sympathetic lament over the hardships of manual labour enerable to me is the hard hand crooked coarse wherein notwithstanding lies a cunning virtue indefeasibly royal as of the sceptre of this planet venerable too is the rugged face all weatheranned besoiled with its rude intelligence for it is the face of a man living manlike o but the more venerable for thy rudeness and even because we must pity as well as love thee hardlyntreated brother for us was thy back so bent for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed thou wert our conscript on whom the lot fell and fighting our battles wert so marred it is through such passages that carlyle has won his way to the hearts of many who care little for history or for german literature the book evidently contains much that is autobiographical and helps us to understand carlyle childhood and youth but it is so mixed up with fantasy and humour that it is difficult to separate fiction from fact its chief aim seems to be the overthrow of cant the ridiculing of empty conventions and the preaching of sincerity and independence but not yet was carlyle generation prepared to listen to such sermons jeffrey was bewildered by the tone and offended at the style publisher after publisher refused it and when at length it was launched upon the world piecemeal in fraser magazine the reading public either ignored it or abused it in the roundest terms during all this time carlyle was anxiously looking for some surer means of livelihood and had not yet decided that literature was to be his profession he had hopes at different times of professorships in edinburgh and st andrews and of the editorship of various reviews but these all came to nothing for some posts he was not suited for others his application could find no support he even thought of going to america where emerson and other admirers would have welcomed him but the disappointments in scotland decided him to make one more effort in london before accepting defeat and in he found a house at chelsea and prepared to quit his hermitage among the moors cheyne row chelsea was to be his new home a quiet street running northward from the riverside in a quarter of london not then invaded by industrialism the house no with its little garden has been made into a carlyle museum and may still be seen on the east side of the street facing a few survivors of the sturdy old pollarded limerees standing there ike giants in tawtie wigs his bust by boehm is in the garden on the embankment not a hundred yards away with this district are connected other names famous in literature and art but its presiding genius is the age of chelsea who spent the last fortyeven years of his life in it and there in a doublealled room in spite of trivial disturbances from without in spite of far more serious fits of dejection and discontent within he composed his three greatest historical books at the outset his prospects were not bright and at the end of he confessed t is now twentyhree months since i earned a penny by the craft of literature there was need of much faith and it was fortunate for him that he had at his side one who believed in his genius and who was well qualified to judge he must have been thinking of this when he wrote of mahomet in heroes and of the prophet gratitude to his first wife kadijah he believed in me when none else would believe in the whole world i had but one friend and she was that in the same place he quoted the german writer novalis t is certain my conviction gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it so fortified he worked through the days of poverty and gloom with groans and outbursts of fury kindling to white heat as he imaged to himself the men and events of the french revolution and throwing them on to paper in lurid pictures of flame one terrible misadventure chilled his spirit in when the manuscript of the first volume was lent to j s mill and was accidentally burnt but after a short fit of despair he set manfully to work to repair the loss and the new version was finished in january this book marked an epoch in the writing of history hitherto few had realized what potent force there was in the original documents lying stored in libraries and record offices they were ive shells buried in the dust of a neglected magazine and in the hands of carlyle they came to life again and worked havoc among the traditional judgements of history this book was also the turning point in his career dickens thackeray and others hailed it with enthusiasm gradually it made its way with the public at large and as in the following years carlyle prompted by some friends gave successful courses of lectures his position among men of letters became assured and he had no more need to worry over money living in london he became known to a wider circle and his marvellous powers of conversation brought visitors and invitations in larger measure than he desired the new friends whom he valued most were mr and lady harriet baring and he was often their guest in london in surrey in scotland and later at the grange in hampshire but he remained faithful to his older and more humble friends while he also made himself accessible to young men of letters who seemed anxious to learn and who did not offend one or other of his many prejudices such were sterling ruskin tennyson and james anthony froude note the most famous course on heroorship was delivered in may note afterwards lord and lady ashburton despite these successes carlyle letters at this time are full of the usual discontents london life and society stimulated him for the time but he paid dearly for it late dinners and prolonged bouts of talk in which he put forth all his powers were followed by dyspepsia and lassitude next day and the neighbours who kept dogs or cocks which were accused of disturbing his slumbers were the mark for many plaints and lamentations he could not in any circumstances be entirely happy work was so exciting with the imagination on fire that it kept him awake at night idleness was still more fatal in its effects and so after a few years of relative calm in we find his active brain struggling to create a true picture of oliver cromwell and to expound the meaning of the great civil war it was to be no easy task for nearly five years he was to wrestle with the subject trying in vain to give it adequate shape and form and then to scrap the labours of years and to start again on a new plan but in the end he was to win another signal victory while the french revolution may be the higher artistic triumph cromwell is more important for one who wishes to understand the lifeork of carlyle and all for which he stood the emptiness of political theories and institutions the enduring value of character are lessons which no one has preached more forcibly in his opinion the success of the english revolution the blow to tyranny and misgovernment in church and state was not due to eloquent members of the long parliament but to plain godearing men who if they quoted scripture did so not from hypocrisy but because it was the language in which they habitually thought nor could they build up a new england till they had found a leader it was the ages which had faith to recognize their worthiest man and to accept his guidance which had achieved great things in the world not those which prated of democracy and progress to make his countrymen in this age of fluent political talk see the true moral quality of the men of the seventeenth century his it was which occupied seven years of carlyle life and filled his thoughts it was indeed a labour of hercules much of the material was lost beyond repair much buried in voluminous folios and state papers much obscured by the cant and prejudice of eighteenthentury authors to recall the past carlyle needed such help as geography would give him and he spent many days in visiting dunbar worcester and other sites to naseby he went in in company with dr arnold and lucked two gowans and a cowslip from the burial heaps of the slain a more important task was to recover authentic utterances of cromwell and his fellow workers and to put these in the place of the secondand judgements of political partisans and this involved laborious researches in libraries above all he had to interpret these records in a new spirit exercising true insight and sympathy to put life into the dry bones and to present his readers with the living image of a man he combined in unique fashion the laborious research of a student with the moral fervour of a prophet despite the strain of these labours carlyle showed few signs of his fifty years the family were of tough stock and the years which he had spent in moorland air had increased the capital of health on which he could draw the flight of time was chiefly marked by his growing antipathy to the political movements of the day and by a growing despondency about the future people might buy his books but he looked in vain for evidence that they paid heed to the lessons which he preached the year of revolutions followed by the setting up of the french empire and the collapse of the roman republic produced nothing but disappointment and he became louder and more bitter in his judgements on democracy saw the birth of the latteray pamphlets in which he outraged mill and the radicals by his scornful words about negro emancipation and by the savage delight with which he shattered their idols he loved to expose what seemed to him the sophistries involved in the conventional praise of liberty of old the mediaeval serf or the negro slave had some one who was responsible for him some one interested in his physical welleing the new conditions too often meant nothing but liberty to starve liberty to be idle liberty to slip back into the worst indulgences while those who might have governed stood by regardless and lent no help such from an extreme point of view appeared the policy of laisseraire and he was neither moderate nor impartial in stating his case n idle white gentleman is not pleasant to me but what say you to an idle black gentleman with his rum bottle in his hand no breeches on his body pumpkin at discretion and the fruitfullest region of the earth going back to jungle round him in a similar vein he dealt with stump oratory prison reform and other subjects tilting in reckless fashion at the shields of the reforming radicals of the day nor was he less outspoken when he met in person the champions of these views a letter to his wife in tells of a visit to the brights at rochdale how ohn and i discorded in our views not a little and how shook peaceable brightdom as with a passing earthquake from books he could learn to human teachers he proved refractory had he been more willing to listen to others his judgements on contemporary events might have been more valuable all his life he was as george meredith says itanic rather than olympian a heaver of rocks not a shaper and this fever of denunciation grew with advancing years but with these spurts of volcanic energy alternate moods of the deepest depression his journal for says his seems really the nadir of my fortunes and in hope desire or outlook so far as common mortals reckon such i never was more bankrupt lonely shut up within my contemptible and yet not deliberately ignoble self perhaps there never was in modern literary or other history a more solitary soul capable of any friendship or honest relation to others by this time he was feeling the need of another task and in he chose frederick the great of prussia for the subject of his next book to this generation apology seems to be needed for an english author who lavishes so much admiration on prussian men and institutions but carlyle whose chief heroes had been men of intense religious convictions like luther knox and cromwell could find no hero after his heart in english history subsequent to the civil war eloquent pitts and burkes jobbing walpoles and pelhams were to him types of politicians who had brought england to her present plight german literature had always kept its influence over him and had directed his attention to german history frederick without religion as he was seemed at any rate sincere recognized facts and showed practical capacity for ruling essential elements in the carlylean her and the subject would be new to his readers the labour involved was stupendous it was to fill his life and the lives of his helpers for thirteen years of these helpers the chief credit is due to joseph neuberg who piloted him over german railways libraries and battleields in the search for picturesque detail and to henry larkin who toiled in london to trace references in scores of authors and who finally crowned the work by laborious indexing which made carlyle labyrinth accessible to his readers there were masses of material hidden away and unsifted and as in the case of cromwell only a man of original genius could penetrate this inert mass with shafts of light and make the past live again the task grew as he continued his researches he groped his way back to the beginning of the hohenzollerns and sketched the portraits of the old electors in a style unequalled for vividness and humour he drew a fullength portrait of frederick william most famous of drillergeants and he studied the campaigns of his son with a thoroughness which has been a model to soldiers and civilians ever since we have the record of two tours which he made in germany to view the scene of operations and it is amazing how exact a picture he could bring away from a short visit to each separate battleield his diligence accuracy and wide grasp of the subject satisfied the severest judges and the book won him a success as complete and enduring in germany as in england and america note froude carlyle life in london vol and when this was finished carlyle was on the verge of seventy and his work was done though the evening of his life was long his strength was exhausted his wife lived just long enough to see the seal set upon his fame and to hear of his election to be lord rector of edinburgh university but in april while he was in scotland for his installation which she was too weak to attend he heard the news of her sudden death from heart failure in london and after this he was a broken man by reading her journal he learnt too late how much his own inconsiderate temper had added to her trials and his remorse was bitter and lasting he shut himself off from all his friends except froude who was to be his literary executor and gave himself to collecting and annotating the memorials which she had left each letter is followed by some words of tender recollection or some cry of selfeproach he has erected to her the most singular of literary monuments morbid perhaps but inspired by a feeling which was in his case natural and sincere about he began to lose the use of his right hand and he found it impossible to compose by dictation of the last years of his life there is little to narrate the offer of a baronetcy or the g b from mr disraeli in pleased him for the moment but he resolutely refused external honours he took daily walks with froude daily drives when he became too weak to go on foot towards the end the bible and shakespeare were his most habitual reading he had long ceased to be a member of any church but his belief in god and in god working in history was the very foundation of his being and the lessons of the bible were to him inexhaustible and ever new death came to him peacefully in february and as he had expressed a definite wish he was buried at ecclefechan though a public funeral in the abbey was offered and its acceptance would have met with the approval of his countrymen the very wealth of records makes it difficult to judge his character fairly few men have so laid bare the thoughts and feelings of their hearts it is easy to blame the unmanly laments which he utters over his health his solitude and his sufferings real or imaginary few imaginative writers have the everyay virtues his egotism too is difficult to defend if as he himself admits he invariably took an undue share of talk often in fact monopolizing it wherever he was we must remember that the brilliance of his gifts was admitted by all less pardonable is his habit of disparaging other men and especially other men of letters his penictures of mill wordsworth coleridge and others are wonderfully vivid but too often sour in flavour his sketch of charles lamb is an outrage on that generous and kindly soul too often he was unconscious of the pain given by such random words when he was brought to book he was honourable enough to recant fearing on one occasion to have offended even the serene loyalty of emerson he cries out protestingly as not the man emerson from old years been a human friend to me can i ever forget or think otherwise than lovingly of the man emerson but whatever offence carlyle committed with his ungovernable tongue or pen he had rare virtues in conduct his generosity was as unassuming as it was persistent and it began at home long before he was free from anxieties about money for himself he was helping two of his brothers to make a career one in agriculture and the other in medicine in his latter days he regularly gave away large sums in such a way that no one knew the source from which they came his letters show a deep tenderness of affection for his mother his wife and others of the family and the humble annandale home was always in his thoughts his charity embraced even those whose claim on him was but indirect when his wife was dead he could remember to celebrate her birthday by sending a present to her old nurse he was scrupulous in moneyealing and frugal in all matters of personal comfort in his innermost thoughts he was always pureearted and sincere for nothing on earth would he traffic in his independence or in adherence to the truth his style has not largely influenced other historians and this is as well since imitations of it easily fall into mere obscurity and extravagance but his historical method has been of great value the patient study of original authorities the copious references quoted the careful indexing all being proof how anxious he was that the subject should be presented clearly and veraciously rather than that the books should shine as literary performances how far the principles which he valued and taught have spread it is difficult to say party politicians still appeal to the sacred name of liberty without inquiring what true liberty means publicists still speak as if the material gains of modern life cheap food and machineade products meant nothing but advance in the history of the human race but there are others who look to the spiritual factors and wish to enlarge the bounds of political economy the writings of carlyle and of ruskin on whom fell the prophet mantle certainly made their influence felt in later books devoted to that once ismal science few can be quite indifferent to the man or to his message those who demand moderation clearness and attic simplicity will be repelled by his extravagances or by his mysticism others will be attracted by his glowing imagination and by his fiery eloquence and will reserve for him a foremost place in their affections these will echo the words which emerson was heard to say on his deathed when his eyes fell on a portrait of the familiar rugged features that is the man my man illustration sir robert peel from the painting by j linnell in the national portrait galler sir robert peel born near bury lancashire july harrow school christ church oxford p for cashel ireland underecretary for the colonies chief secretary for ireland p for oxford university president of bullion committee marriage to julia daughter of general sir john floyd home secretary in lord liverpool government canning short ministry and death home secretary and leader in commons under the duke of wellington catholic emancipation carried lord grey reform bill carried prime minister tamworth manifesto edchamber plot peel fails to form ministry prime minister a second time peel bank act corn laws repealed peel defeated on irish coercion bill resigns accident june and death july sir robert peel statesman in the years that lay between the treaty of utrecht and the close of the napoleonic wars british politics were largely dominated by walpole and the two pitts their great figures only stand out in stronger relief because their place was filled for a time by such weak ministers as newcastle and bute as grafton and north in the nineteenth century there were many gifted statesmen who held the position of first minister of the crown disraeli and palmerston by shrewdness and force of character canning and derby by brilliant oratorical gifts russell and aberdeen by earnest devotion to public service were all commanding figures in their day whose claims to the chieftainship of a party and of a government were generally admitted gladstone the most versatile genius of them all had abilities second to none but his place in history will for long be a subject of acute controversy he stands too close to our own time to be fairly judged of the others no one had the same combination of gifts as sir robert peel no one had in the same measure that particular knowledge judgement and ability which characterize the statesman his career was the most fruitful his work the most enduring he has left his mark in english history to a degree which no one of his rivals can equal the peel family can be traced back to the misty days of danish inroads its original home in england is disputed between yorkshire and lancashire but as early as the days of elizabeth the branch from which our statesman was descended is certainly to be found at blackburn and its members lived for generations as sturdy yeomen of that district the first of them known to strike out an independent line was his grandfather robert peel who with his brothernaw mr haworth started the first firm for calicorinting in lancashire about the year ceasing the practice of sending the material to be printed in france this grandfather was a type of the men who were making the new england leading the way in the creation of industries that were to transform the north and midlands the business prospered and he moved from blackburn to burtonnrent where he built three new mills his third son named robert was also gifted with resource beginning as a member of the family firm he soon came to be its chief director and added another branch at tamworth where later he built the house of drayton manor the family seat in the nineteenth century he was a tory and a staunch follower of the younger pitt who rewarded his services with a baronetcy in he too was a typical man of his age and class an age of material progress and expansion a class full of selfonfidence and animated by a spirit of stubborn resistance to soalled unnglish ideas his eldest son the third robert and the second baronet is our subject it is impossible to grasp the springs of his conduct unless we know what traditions he inherited from his forbears peel education was begun at home with a specific purpose though his father had every reason to be satisfied with his own success for his son he cherished a yet higher ambition and one which he did not conceal he said openly that he intended him to be prime minister of his country the knowledge of this provoked many jests among the boy friends and caused him no slight embarrassment it conspired with the shyness and reserve which were innate in him to win him from the outset a reputation for pride and aloofness if he had not been forced to with those of his own age and if he had not resolutely set himself to overcome this feeling he might have grown into a student and a recluse both at school and college he did to his book at harrow he roused the greatest hopes his brilliant schoolfellow lord byron while claiming to excel him in general information and history admits that peel was greatly his superior as a scholar the working of their minds now and afterwards was curiously different bagehot illustrates the contrast by a striking metaphor byron mind he says worked by momentary eruptions of volcanic force from within and then relapsed into inactivity peel on the other hand steadily accumulated knowledge and opinions his mind receiving impressions from outward experience like the alluvial soil deposited by a river in its course but this is to anticipate at oxford peel was the first man to win a ouble first i e a first class both in classics and mathematic in which distinction gladstone alone among our prime ministers equalled him but he also found time during the term to indulge in cricket in rowing and in riding while in the vacation he developed a more marked taste for shooting and thus freed himself from the charge of being a mere bookworm he was goodooking rather a dandy in his dress stiff in his manner regular in his habits conforming to the oxford standards of excellence and as yet showing few signs of independence of character note walter bagehot biographical studies p longmans peel went into parliament early after the fashion of the day he was twentyne when in a seat was offered him at cashel in ireland the system of otten boroughs had many faults ur textooks of history do not spare it ut it may claim to have offered an easy way into parliament for some men of brilliant talents peel family connexions and his own training marked out the path for him it was difficult for the young oxford prizeman not to follow lord chancellor eldon that stout survival of the high old tories it was impossible for his father son not to sit behind the successors of pitt we shall see how far his own reasoning powers and clear vision led him from this path but the early influences were never quite effaced his first patron was lord liverpool to whom he became private secretary in the following year this nobleman described by disraeli in a famous passage as an rchediocrity was prime minister for fifteen years he owed his long tenure of office largely to the tolerance with which he allowed his abler lieutenants to usurp his power perhaps he owed it still more to the victories which wellington was then winning abroad and which secured the confidence of the country but at least he seems to have been a good judge of men in he promoted peel to be underecretary for the colonies and in to be chief secretary for ireland his abilities must have made a great impression to win him such promotion he must have had plenty of selfonfidence to undertake such duties for he was only twentyour years old we are accustomed toay to underecretaries of forty or fortyive but we must remember that the younger pitt led the house of commons at twentyour and was prime minister at twentyive at dublin castle peel was not expected to deal with the great political questions which convulsed parliament at different periods of the century he had to administer the law it was routine work of a tedious and difficult kind it involved the close study of facts ot in order to make a showy speech or to win a case for the moment but in order to frame practical measures which would stand the test of time peel eschewed the usual recreations of dublin society and flung himself into his work wholeeartedly in roman history we see how caesar was trained in the details of administration as quaestor aedile praetor consul while pompeius passed in a lordly progress from one high command to another how caesar voluntarily exiled himself from rome for ten years to conquer and develop gaul while cicero bewailed himself over a few months absence from the forum of these three famous men only one proved himself able to guide the ship of state in stormy waters analogy must not be too closely pressed but we see that while canning for all his ability established no durable influence and his oratory burnt itself out after a brief blaze while wellington fame paled year after year from his inability to control the course of civil strife peel light burnt brighter every decade as he rose from office to office and faced one difficult situation after another with coolness and success he stayed at his post in dublin for six years he worked at the details of his office ducation agriculture and police nd brought in many practical reforms his beneficial activity is still better seen in the years to when he was home secretary toay he is chiefly remembered as the eponymous hero of our police but in many other ways his tenure of the latter office is a landmark in departmental work it may be that he originated little himself that romilly was the pioneer in the humanizing of law that horner taught him the doctrines of sound finance that huskisson led the way in freeing trade from the shackles with which it had been bound but peel in all these cases lent generous support and made their cause his own he had a cool head and a warm heart a knowledge of parliament and an influence in parliament already unrivalled he saw what could be done and how it could be done and so he was able to push through successfully the reforms which his colleagues initiated the value of his work in this sphere has never been seriously contested the point on which peel enemies fastened in judging his career was the number of times that he changed his convictions abandoned his party and carried through a measure which he himself had formerly opposed to understand his claim to be called a great statesman it is particularly necessary to study these changes the first instance was the reform of the currency early in the french wars the london banks had been in difficulties the government was forced to borrow large sums from the bank of england in order to give subsidies to our allies and was unable to pay its debts the bank could not at the same time meet the demands of the government and the claims of its private customers since a panic might at any moment cause an unprecedented run on its reserves pitt suspended cash payments till six months after the conclusion of peace the bank was thus allowed to circulate notes without being obliged to pay full cash value for them immediately on demand and the purchasing power of these notes tended to vary far more than that of a metal currency also foreigners refused to accept a pound note in the place of a pound sterling foreign payments had to be made in specie and the gold was rapidly drained abroad when the war was over horner and other economists began to draw attention to the bad effect of this on foreign trade and to the varying price of commodities at home due to the want of a fixed currency as pitt had allowed the system of inconvertible paper the tories generally applauded and were ready to perpetuate it the elder sir robert peel had been always a firm supporter of these views and his son began by accepting them he continued to acquiesce in them till his attention was definitely turned to the subject in he was asked to be a member of a committee of very eminent men including canning and mackintosh which was to investigate the question and he was elected chairman of it but though his verdict was taken for granted by his party his mind was so constituted that he could not shut it against evidence he listened to arguments and judged them fairly and being by nature unable to palter with the truth once he was convinced of it he threw in all his weight with the reformers and reported in favour of a return to cash payments history has vindicated his judgement and he himself crowned his financial work by the famous bank act of passed when he was prime minister the second question on which peel conduct surprised his colleagues was that of catholic emancipation since roman catholic electors had the parliamentary vote but since no roman catholic could sit in parliament they had hitherto been content to cast their votes for the more tolerant of the protestant candidates pitt had failed to induce george to grant the catholics civil equality and george despite his liberal professions took up the same attitude as his father on succeeding to the throne but the majority of the whigs and some even of the tories such as castlereagh and canning were prepared to make concessions and since the irish agitation led by had been gaining in strength peel had several reasons for being on the other side his early training by his father his friendship with eldon and wellington his attachment to the established church all had influence upon him he saw clearly that disestablishment would follow closely in ireland on the granting of the catholic demands and since when he became member for oxford university he felt bound to resist this in taking this line he was no better and no worse than any other tory member of the day and in later times many politicians have allowed their traditions and prejudices to blind them to the existence of an irish problem for all that peel ought earlier to have recognized the facts to have looked ahead and formed a policy as chief secretary for ireland he had unrivalled opportunities for studying the whole question but he did not let it penetrate beneath the surface of his mind he had continued to bring up the same arguments on the few occasions when he spoke at westminster and had buried himself in administrative work he seems to have hoped that he could evade it if the whigs got a majority and introduced an emancipation bill he would have satisfied his constituents by formally opposing the measure and would not have gone beyond this as he saw it gradually coming he satisfied his own conscience by retiring from lord liverpool government and by refusing to join canning when he became prime minister in as a private member he would only be responsible for his own vote and would not feel that he was settling the question for others but canning died after holding office only a month and a government was formed by wellington in which peel returned to office as home secretary and became leader of the house of commons now he had to pay the penalty for his lack of foresight and to deal with the tide of feeling which had been rising for some years on both sides of the irish channel at least he could see facts which were before his eyes in before he had been twelve months in office his decision was aided by a definite event a bylection had to be fought in clare mr fitzgerald seeking relection on joining the government against him came forward no less a person than daniel himself the most eloquent and most popular of the catholic leaders and although under the existing laws his candidature was void he received an overwhelming majority the bewilderment of the tories was ludicrous fitzgerald himself wrote he proceedings of yesterday were those of madmen but the country is mad peel took a careful view of the situation and decided on his course he certainly laid himself open to the charge of giving way before a breach of the law and the charge was pressed by the angry tories but his judgement was clearly based on a complete survey of all the facts a single event was the candle which lit up the scene but by the light of it he surveyed the whole room he still held to his view about the dangers of disestablishment ahead but he maintained that a crisis had arisen involving graver dangers at the moment and that the statesman must choose the lesser of two evils there is no doubt that the situation was critical the duke of wellington and lord anglesey a waterloo veteran who was lord lieutenant of irelan both had fears of mutiny in the army and civil war was to be expected if was not admitted to the house of commons peel personal consistency was one matter the public welfare was another and a weightier his first idea was to retire from office and to lend unofficial support to a measure which he could not advocate in principle but the only hope of breaking down the old tory opposition lay in the influence of the tory ministers no whig government could prevail in the temper of that time and wellington appealed in the strongest terms to peel to remain in office and to lead the house peel yielded from motives of public policy and made himself responsible for a measure of catholic emancipation which he had been pledged to resist it was a surrender n undisguised surrender nd peel did not as on the bullion committee profess to have changed his mind but it was an honest surrender carried out in the light of day and before parliament met peel announced his decision to resign his seat at oxford and to give his constituents the chance of expressing their opinion of his conduct the verdict was not long in doubt the university which in rejected another of its brilliant sons gave a majority of one hundred and fortyix against him and his political connexion with oxford was severed the verdict of posterity has been more liberal the chief fault laid to peel charge is that he should for so many years have ignored all signs of the danger which was approaching and not have made up his mind in time he could see the crisis clearly when it came and could put the national interest above everything else he could not look far enough ahead it was a similar want of foresight that led to the fall of the tory government in the reform movement so long delayed by the great wars had been gathering force again events in france where charles was driven from the throne and louis philippe proclaimed as citizening gave it additional impetus the famous lawyer brougham was thundering against the government in parliament while throughout the country the platforms from which radical orators declaimed were surrounded by eager throngs the history of the movement cannot be told here its chief actors were the whigs who on wellington resignation formed a government under earl grey at the end of peel was fighting a losing fight and he did not show his usual judgement or cool temper he opposed the reform bill to the last he was haranguing violently against it when black rod arrived to summon the commons to the presence of the king william came down in person at the instance of the whig ministers to dissolve parliament and so to stay all proceedings by which in the as yet unreformed parliament the bill might have been defeated in the general election of the whigs carried all before them and in july when lord grey carried the second reading he could command a majority of even then it took three months of stubborn fighting to vanquish the tory opposition in the house of commons when the peers rejected the bill the question was raised whether a tory government could be formed but peel however he might dislike the bill could recognize facts and his refusal to coperate in defying public opinion was decisive lord grey returned to office fortified by the king promise to make any number of new peers if required and the influence of wellington was effective in dissuading the upper house from further futile resistance again peel had shown his good sense in accepting the situation so far as he was concerned there was no talk of repeal he explicitly said that he regarded the question as inally and irrevocably disposed of and he set to work to adapt his policy to the new situation it might well seem a desperate one for the tories here were three hundred new members most of whom had just received their seats from the whigs against the direct opposition of their rivals gratitude and selfnterest impelled them to support the whig party and its leaders who had for nearly fifty years been out in the cold shade of opposition might count on a long spell of power especially as the canningites stronger in talents than in numbers joined them at this juncture brougham had gone to the house of lords but three future prime ministers tanley afterwards lord derb lord john russell and palmerston ere in the house of commons serving under lord althorp who though gifted with no oratorical talent by his good sense and still more by his high character commanded general respect on the other side there was only one figure of the first rank and that was peel till he had not grown to his full stature the reformed parliament gave him his chance and drew forth all his powers it represented a new force in politics no longer were the members sent to westminster by a few great landolders by the small market towns and by the agricultural labourers the great industrial districts lancashire yorkshire and the midlands were there in the persons of welloo citizens experienced in business and serious in temper and peel who was himself sprung from a notable family of this kind was eminently the man to lead these classes and to win their confidence it was also a gain to him to stand alone his judgement was ripened his confidence firm and he could dominate his party while the able and ambitious leaders on the other side too often clashed with one another above all in the years to he showed that he had patience instead of snatching at occasions to ally himself with who was in opposition to every government and to embarrass the whigs in a factious partypirit he showed a marked respect for principle he supported or opposed the whig bills purely on their merits and gradually trained his party to be ready for the inevitable reaction when it should come by the tendencies to disruption in the victorious party were clearly showing themselves first stanley on grounds of policy and then lord grey for personal reasons never quite cleared up resigned office soon after lord althorp left the house of commons on succeeding to his father earldom and a little later melbourne the new premier was unexpectedly dismissed by the king at the time peel expecting no immediate crisis was abroad in rome and we have interesting details of his slow journey home to meet the urgent call of wellington who was carrying on the administration provisionally the changes of the last few years were shown by the fact that the tories felt bound to choose their premier from the lower house it was wellington who recommended peel for the place which under the old conditions he might have been expected to take himself on his return peel accepted the task of forming a ministry and conscious of the numerical weakness of his own party he made overtures to some of the whigs but stanley and graham refused to join him and he had to fall back on the tories of wellington last government before going to the country he laid down his principles in the famous tamworth manifesto this manifesto is important for its acceptance of the changes permanently made by the reform bill and for the clear exposition of his attitude towards the important church questions which were imminent it is an excellent document for any one to study who wishes to understand the evolution of the old tories into the modern conservative party note sir james graham afterwards home secretary under peel in note since his father death in peel had been member for tamworth peel first administration was not destined to last long the liberal wave was not spent and the tories had little to hope for at this moment from a general election as so often happened afterwards when the two english parties were evenly balanced the irish votes turned the scale peel had been forced into this position by the king his own judgement would have led him to wait some years he fought dexterously for four months helped in some measure by stanley who had left the whigs when they threatened the established church in ireland but it was this question which in the end upset him lord john russell in alliance with proposed the disendowment of that church and defeated peel by thirtyhree votes it was a question of principle though it was raised in a factious way and subsequent history showed that the mover after his tactical victory of the moment could not effect any practical solution peel was driven to resign but in this short period so far from losing credit he had won the confidence of his party and the respect of his opponents he had put some useful measures on the statute book and he had shown the country that a new spirit practical and enlightened was growing up in the tory party and that there was a minister capable of utilizing it for the general good in the greville papers and other literature of the time we get many references to the predominant place which he held in the esteem of the house of commons an entry in greville journal for february shows peel unique power o matter how unruly the house how impatient or fatigued the moment he rises all is silence and he is sure of being heard with profound attention and respect lady lyttelton who met him later at windsor shows us another aspect his readiness and presence of mind come out in the most trivial matters when queen victoria suddenly one evening issued her command that all who could dance were to dance the more elderly guests were much embarrassed such an order was not to peel taste e was in fact to a close observer evidently both shy and cross but he was uch the best figure of all so mincing with his legs and feet his countenance full of the funniest attempt to look unconcerned and matter of course another time when games were improvised in the royal circle lady lyttelton was uch struck with the quickness and watchful cautious characteristic sagacity which sir robert showed in learning and playing a new round game and to the ladiesnaiting he commended himself by his quiet courtesy ir robert peel we read as in his most conversable mood and so very agreeable i never enjoyed an evening more note correspondence of sarah lady lyttelton by maud wyndham murray perhaps the best description to show how personally he impressed his contemporaries at this time is given by lord dalling and bulwer in his memoir sir robert peel he tells us was all and powerfully built his body somewhat bulky for his limbs his head small and wellormed his features regular his countenance was not what would be generally called expressive but it was capable of taking the expression he wished to give it humour sarcasm persuasion and command being its alternate characteristics the character of the man was seen more in the whole person than in the face he did not stoop but he bent rather forwards his mode of walking was peculiar and rather like that of a cat but of a cat that was well acquainted with the ground it was moving over the step showed no doubt or apprehension it could hardly be called stealthy but it glided on firmly and cautiously without haste or swagger or unevenness the oftener you heard him speak the more his speaking gained upon you he never seemed occupied with himself his effort was evidently directed to convince you not that he was eloquent but that he was right he seemed rather to aim at gaining the doubtful than mortifying or crushing the hostile these qualities appealed especially to the practical men of business whom the reform bill had brought into politics they were suited to the temper of the day and his speaking won the favour of the best judges in the house of commons though he disappointed ardent crusaders like lord shaftesbury by his apparent coldness and calculating caution he impressed his fellow members as preminently honest and as anxious to advance in the most effective manner those causes which his judgement approved he was not the man to lead a forlorn hope but rather the sagacious commander who directed his troops through a practicable breach he was to be in opposition for another six years but during these years the whigs were in constant difficulties and as greville notes it was often obvious that peel was leading the house from the front opposition bench had he imitated russell conduct in and devoted his chief energies to overthrowing the whigs he could have found many an occasion sedition in canada and jamaica rivalry with france in the levant and with russia in the farther east financial troubles and deficits the spread of chartist doctrine all combined to embarrass a government which had no single will and no concentrated resolution the accession of queen victoria in made no change for the moment but wellington famous remark that the tories would have no chance with a queen because peel had no manners and he had no small talk is only quoted now because of the falsity of the prediction both politicians soon came to form a better estimate of her judgement and public spirit it was some years before this could be fairly tested the tories while improving their position failed to gain an absolute majority in the elections and peel want of tact in insisting on the queen changing all the ladies of her household delayed his triumph from to meanwhile he spent his energies in training his party and organizing their resources he studied measures and he studied men and he gradually gathered round him a body of loyal followers who believed in their chief and were ready to help him in administrative reform when the time should come among his most devoted adherents was mr gladstone at this time more famous as a churchman than as a financier and even mr disraeli for all his eccentricities accepted peel leadership without question few could then foresee the very different careers that lay before his two brilliant lieutenants by the power of the whigs was spent a vote of want of confidence was carried by peel the king dissolved parliament and the tories came back with a majority of ninety in the new house of commons now begins the most famous part of peel career that associated with the repeal of the corn laws the third of his soalled etrayals of his party no action of his has been so variously criticized none caused such bitterness in political circles there is no space here to discuss the value of protection or the wisdom of the antiornaw league still less the merits or demerits of a fixed duty as opposed to a lidingcale we are concerned with peel conduct and must try to answer the questions hat were peel earlier views on the subject what caused him to change these views was this change effected honestly or was he guilty of abandoning his party in order to retain office himself the corn laws introduced in renacted in forbade any one to import corn into england till the price of homerown corn had reached eighty shillings a quarter it is easy to attack a system based on rigid figures applied to conditions varying widely in every century but the idea was that the english farmer should be given a decisive advantage over his foreign rivals and only when the price rose to a prohibitive point might the interest of the consumer be allowed to outweigh that of the producer the revival of the old law in met with strong opposition england had greatly changed the agricultural area had not been widely increased but there were many more millions of mouths to feed thanks to the growth of population in the industrial districts but while in the house of commons represented almost exclusively the landwning and cornrowing classes between and opposition to their policy had lately been growing and had been organized outside parliament by the famous league of which richard cobden was the leading spirit peel though he had been brought up by his father a strong protectionist and tory had been largely influenced by huskisson the most remarkable president of the board of trade that this country has ever seen and had shown on many occasions that he grasped the principle of free trade as well as any statesman of the day the whigs had left the finances of the country in a very bad state and peel had to take sweeping measures to restore credit from to he brought in budgets of a free trade character designed to encourage commerce by remitting taxation especially on raw material and he made up the loss thus incurred by the treasury by imposing an incomeax to this policy there were two exceptions the corn laws and the sugar duties on the latter he felt that england since she had abolished slavewning had a duty to her colonies to see that they did not suffer by the competition of sugar produced by slave labour elsewhere on the former he held that england ought so far as possible to produce its own food and to be selfufficing and as a practical man he recognized that it was too much to expect of the agricultural interest so strongly represented in both houses of parliament to pronounce what seemed to be its deatharrant but through these years he came more and more to see that the interest of a class must give way to the interest of the nation and his clear intellect was from time to time shaken by the arguments of the antiornaw league and its orators in he was probably expecting that he would tide over this parliament thanks to his budgets and to good harvests and that at a general election he would be able to declare for a change of fiscal policy without going back on his pledges to the party meanwhile his general attitude had been noted by shrewd observers cobden himself in a speech delivered at birmingham said here can be no doubt that sir robert peel is at heart as good a free trader as i am he has told us so in the house of commons again and again among the causes which influenced peel at the moment two are specially noteworthy as reminding us of the way in which his opinion was changed over catholic emancipation severe critics say that to retain office he surrendered to the agitation of cobden as he had surrendered to that of undoubtedly the increasing size and success of cobden meetings which were on a scale unknown before in political agitation did cause peel to consider fully what he had only half considered before it did help to force open a door in his mind and to break down a wateright compartment but peel mind once opened saw far more than an agitation and a transfer of votes it looked at the merits of the question and surveyed the interest of the whole country he had seen that the fall of a protestant church was less serious than the loss of ireland he now saw that a shock to the agricultural interest was less serious than general starvation in the country and as with the clare election so with the irish potato famine in a definite event arrested his attention and clamoured for instant decision peel was as humane a man as has ever presided over the destinies of this country and the picture of ireland sufferings was brought forcibly before his imagination by the reports presented to him and by his own knowledge of the country his personal consistency could not be put in the balance against national distress that the manner in which he made the change did give great offence to his followers there is no room to doubt peel was naturally reserved in manner and in his cabinet he occupied a position of such unquestioned superiority that he had no need of advice to make up his mind and was apt to keep matters in his own hand whether he was preparing to consult his colleagues or not the irish potato famine forced his hand before he had done so when in november he made suddenly in the cabinet a definite proposal to suspend the duties on corn only three members supported him year after year peel had opposed the motion brought in by mr villiers for repeal only those who had been studying the situation as closely as peel and with as clear a vision nd they were few ould understand this sudden declaration of a change of policy after holding four cabinet councils in one week winning over some waverers but still failing to get a unanimous vote he expressed a wish to resign but the whigs owing to personal disagreements could not form a ministry and queen victoria asked peel to retain office it was evident that he alone could carry through the measure which he believed to be so urgent and he steeled himself to face the breach with his own party as lord john russell had already pledged the whigs to repeal the issue was no longer in doubt but peel was not to win the victory without heavy cost disraeli who had been offended at not being given a place in the ministry in came forward rallied the agricultural interest and attacked his leader in a series of bitter speeches opening old sores and charging him with having for the second time broken his pledges and betrayed his party the protectionists could not defeat the government in the commons the whig votes ensured a majority in the lords the influence of wellington triumphed over the resistance of the more obstinate landowners the bill passed its third reading by ninetyight votes note the right hon p villiers p for wolverhampton began to advocate repeal in four years before cobden entered parliament but peel knew how uncertain was his position in view of the hostility aroused at this very time the irish question was acute as a coercion bill was under consideration and this gave his enemies their chance the protectionist tories made an unprincipled alliance for the moment with the irish members and on the very day when the repeal of the corn laws passed the house of lords the ministry was defeated in the commons the moment of his fall when disraeli and the protectionists were loudest in their exultation was the moment of his triumph it is the climax of his career in the long debate on repeal he had refused to notice personal attacks he now rose superior to all personal rancour in defeat he bore himself with dignity and in his last speech as minister he praised cobden in very generous terms giving him the chief credit for the benefits which the bill conferred upon his fellowountrymen this speech gave offence to his late colleagues aberdeen sidney herbert and gladstone and was interpreted as being designed to mark clearly peel breach with the conservative party the whole episode is illustrated in an interesting way in the life of gladstone lord morley reports a long conversation between the two friends and colleagues where peel declares his intention to act in future as a private member and to abstain from party politics gladstone while fully allowing that peel had earned the right to retire after such labours ou have been prime minister in a sense in which no other man has been since mr pitt time pointed out how impossible it would be for him to carry out his intentions his personal ascendancy in parliament was too great men must look to him as a leader but peel evidently was at the end of his strength and had been suffering acutely from pains in the head due to an old shooting accident but intensified by recent hard work for the moment repose was essential note morley life of gladstone vol i cf gladstone own retirement in it was gladstone peel disciple and true successor who seven years later paid the following tribute to his memory t is easy he said o enumerate many characteristics of the greatness of sir robert peel it is easy to speak of his ability of his sagacity of his indefatigable industry but there was something yet more admirable and that was his sense of public virtue when he had to choose between personal ease and enjoyment or again on the other hand between political power and distinction and what he knew to be the welfare of the nation his choice was made at once when his choice was made no man ever saw him hesitate no man ever saw him hold back from that which was necessary to give it effect though his own political views changed gladstone always paid tribute to the moral influence which peel had exercised in political life purifying its practices and ennobling its traditions for the last four years of his life he was in opposition but he held a place of dignity and independence which few fallen ministers have ever enjoyed he was the trusted friend and adviser of queen victoria and the prince consort he was often consulted in grave matters by the chiefs of the government his speeches both in the house and in the country carried greater weight than those of any minister despite the bitterness of the protectionists he seemed still to have a great future before him and in any national emergency the country would unfailingly have called him to the helm but on july when he was just reaching the age of sixtywo he had a fall from his horse which caused very grave injuries and he only survived three days the interest of peel life is almost absorbed by public questions he was not picturesque like disraeli he did not like gladstone live long enough to be in his lifetime a mythical figure the public did not cherish anecdotes about his sayings or doings nor did he lend himself to the art of the caricaturist he was an english gentleman to the backbone in his tastes in his conduct in his nature his married life was entirely happy he had a few devoted friends he avoided general society he had a genuine fondness for shooting and country life he was a judicious patron of art and his collection of dutch pictures form toay a very precious part of our national gallery just because of his aloofness his gravity the concentration of his energies he is the best example that we can study if we want to know how an english statesman should train himself to do work of lasting value and how he should bear himself in the hour of trial within little more than half a century three famous politicians peel gladstone and chamberlain have split their parties in two by an abrupt change of policy and their conduct has been bitterly criticized by those to whom the traditions of party are dear it is the glory of british politics that these traditions remained honourable so long and no one of these statesmen broke with them lightly or without regret for all that let us be thankful that from time to time statesmen do arise who are capable of responding to a still higher call of following their own individual consciences and of looking only to what so far as they can

william came of no mean parentage their father colonel the hon george napier of a distinguished scotch family was remarkable alike for physical strength and mental ability in the fervour of his admiration his son charles relates how he could ake a pewter quart and squeeze it flat in his hand like a bit of paper in height feet inches in person very handsome he won the admiration of others besides his sons he had served in the american war but his later years were passed in organizing work and he showed conspicuous honesty and ability in dealing with irish military accounts one of his reforms was the abolition of all fees in his office by which he reduced his own salary from to per annum emulating the more famous act of the elder pitt as paymastereneral half a century before their mother lady sarah lennox daughter of the duke of richmond had been a reigning toast in she had even been courted by george and might have been handed down to history as the mother of princes in her old age she was more proud to be the mother of heroes and her letters still exist written in the period of the great wars to show how a british mother could combine the spartan ideal with the tenderest personal affection illustration sir charles napier from the drawing by edwin williams in the national portrait galler their father appointment involved residence in ireland from onwards and the boys passed their early years at celbridge in the neighbourhood of dublin here they were far from the usual amusements and society of the time but they were fortunate in their home circle and in the character of their servants and they learnt to cherish the ancient legends of ireland and to pick up everything that could feed their innate love of adventure and romance close to their doors lived an old woman named molly dunne who claimed to be one hundred and thirtyive years of age and who was ready to fill the children ears with tales of past tragedies whenever they came to see her sir william napier tells us how she was all gaunt and with high sharp lineaments her eyes fixed in their huge orbs and her tongue discoursing of bloody times she was wondrous for the young and fearful for the aged instead of class feeling and narrow interests the boys developed early a great sympathy for the poor and a capacity for judging people independently of rank charles napier himself born in whitehall was three years old when they moved to ireland he was a sickly child the one short member of a tall family but equal to any of them in courage and resolution his heroism in endurance of pain was put to a severe test when he broke his leg at the age of seventeen it was twice badly set he was threatened first by the entire loss of it next with the prospect of a crooked leg but he bore cheerfully the most excruciating torture in having it straightened by a series of painful experiments and in no long time he recovered his activity in the army he showed his strength of will by rigid abstinence from drinking and gambling no easy feat in those days and he learned by his father example to control all extravagance and to live contentedly on a small allowance his earliest enthusiasm among books was for plutarch lives the favourite reading of so many great commanders he had many outdoor tastes riding fishing and shooting and he was soon familiar with the countryide there was no need of classes or prizes to stimulate his reading no need of organized games to provide an outlet for his energies or to fill his leisure time the confidence that his father had in the training of his sons is best shown by the early age at which he put them in responsible positions charles actually received a commission in the rd regiment at the age of twelve but he did not see service till he was seventeen meanwhile the young ensign continued his schooling from his father house at celbridge to which he and his brother returned every evening sometimes in the most unconventional manner celbridge like other irish villages had its pigs the irish pig is longer in the leg and more active than his english cousin and the napier boys would be seen careering along at a headlong pace on these strange mounts with a cheering company of village boys behind them they were protestants among older roman catholic comrades but they soon became the leaders in the school and charles despite his youth and small stature was chosen to command a school volunteer corps at the age of fourteen at seventeen he joined his regiment at limerick and for six or seven years he led the life of a soldier in various garrison towns of southern england fretting at inaction learning what he could and welcoming any chance of increased work and danger at this time his enthusiasm for soldiering was very variable in a letter written in he makes fun of the routine of his profession as he was set to practise it and ends up uch is the difference between a hero of the present time and the idea of one formed from reading plutarch yet people wonder i don like the army but this was a passing mood when stirring events were taking place no one was more full of ardour and when he came under such a general as sir john moore he expressed himself in a very different tone in moore was commanding at hythe and charles napier letters are aglow with enthusiasm for the great qualities which he showed as an administrator and army reformer like wolseley seventy or eighty years later moore had the gift of finding the best among his subalterns and training them in his own excellences after his own father there was no one who had so much influence as moore in the making of charles napier in he sailed for the peninsula with the rank of major commanding the th regiment in the colonel absence he took an active part in moore famous retreat at coru a and in the battle was taken prisoner after conduct of the greatest gallantry in leading his regiment under fire two months later he was released and again went to the front in and he and his brothers george and william were fighting under wellington and were all so frequently wounded that the family fortunes became a subject of common talk on more than one occasion wellington himself wrote to lady sarah to inform her of the gallantry and misfortunes of her sons at busaco charles had his jaw broken and was forced to retire into hospital at lisbon in his haste to rejoin the army which he did when only half convalescent he accomplished the feat of riding ninety miles on one horse in a single day and in the course of his ride met two of his brothers being carried down wounded to the base but in promotion withdrew charles napier from the peninsula a short command in guernsey was followed by another in bermuda which involved him in the american war he had little taste for warfare with men of the same race as himself and was heartily glad to exchange back to the th in and to return to england he started out as a volunteer to share in the campaign of waterloo but all was over before he could join the army in flanders and this part of his soldiering career ended quietly he had received far more wounds than honours and might well have been discouraged in the pursuit of his profession but here we can put to the test how far napier expressions of distaste for the service affected his conduct he chafed at the inactivity of peace but instead of abandoning the army for some more profitable career he used his enforced leisure to prepare for further service and to extend his knowledge of political and military history he spent the greater part of three years at the military college then established at farnham varying his professional studies with sallies into the domain of politics and as a result he developed marked radical views which he held through life his noteooks show a splendid grasp of principles and a close attention to facts they range from the enforcing of the death penalty for marauding to the details of cavalryit his spartan regime became famous in later years even now he prescribed a strict rule cloak a pair of shoes two flannel shirts and a piece of soap hese wrapped up in an oilkin must go in the right holster and a pistol in the left he took no opinions at second hand but studied the best authorities and thought for himself he was as thorough in selfducation as the famous confederate general tonewall jackson who every evening sat for an hour facing a blank wall and reviewing in his mind the subjects which he had read during the day no opportunity for reaping the fruit of these studies and exercising his great gifts was given him till may then he was appointed to the post of inspectingfficer in the ionian islands and in he was appointed military resident in cephalonia the largest of these islands a pile of rugged limestone hills scantily supplied with water and ruined by years of neglect and the oppression of turkish pashas so began what was certainly the happiest and perhaps the most fruitful period in charles napier life it was not strictly military work but without the authority which his military rank gave him and without the despotic methods of martial law little could have been achieved in the disordered state of the country the whole episode is a good example of how a wellrained soldier of original mind can when left to himself impress his character on a semiivilized people and may be compared with the work of sir harry smith in south africa or sir henry lawrence in the punjab the practical reforms which he initiated in law in commerce in agriculture are too numerous to mention xpect no letters from me he writes to his mother ave about roads no going home for me it would be wrong to leave a place where so much good is being done my marketlace is roofed my pedestal is a tremendous job but two months more will finish that also my roads will not be finished by me and again take no rest myself and give nobody else any to his superiors he showed himself somewhat impracticable in temper and he was certainly exacting to his subordinates though generous in his praise of those who helped him he was compassionate to the poor and vigorous in his dealings with the privileged classes and he gave the islanders an entirely new conception of justice when he quitted the island after six years of office he left behind him two new marketlaces one and a half miles of pier one hundred miles of road largely blasted out of solid rock spacious streets a girls school and many other improvements and he put into the natives a spirit of endeavour which outlived his term of office one sign of the latter was that after his departure some peasants yearly transmitted to him the profits of a small piece of land which he had left uncared for without disclosing the names of those whose labours had earned it note ceded to great britain in and given by her in to greece during this period in visits to corinth and the morea he worked out strategic plans for keeping the turks out of greece he also made friends with lord byron who came out in to help the greek patriots and to meet his death in the swamps of missolonghi byron conceived the greatest admiration for napier talents and believed him to be capable of liberating greece if he were given a free hand but this was not to be reasons of state and petty rivalries barred the way to the appointment of a british general though it might have set the name of napier in history beside those of bolivar and garibaldi for he would have identified himself heart and soul with such a cause and in the opinion of many good judges would have triumphed over the difficulties of the situation from to there is little to narrate the gifts which might have been devoted to commanding a regiment to training young officers or to ruling a distant province were too lightly rated by the government and he spent his time quietly in england and france educating his two daughters interesting himself in politics and continuing to learn it was the political crisis in england which called him back to active life the readjustment of the labour market to meet the use of machinery and the occurrence of a series of bad harvests had caused widespread discontent and the chartist movement was at its height in labourers and factory owners were alarmed the government was besieged with petitions for military protection at a hundred points and all the elements of a dangerous explosion were gathered together at this critical time charles napier was offered the command of the troops in the northern district and amply did he vindicate the choice by the most careful preparation beforehand by the most consummate coolness in the moment of danger he rode the storm he saw the danger of billeting small detachments of troops in isolated positions he concentrated them at the important points he interviewed alarmed magistrates and he attended in person and unarmed a large gathering of chartists to all he spoke calmly but resolutely he made it clear to the rich that he would not order a shot to be fired while peaceful measures were possible he made it equally clear to the chartists that he would suppress disorder if it arose promptly and mercilessly with only four thousand troops under his command to control all the industrial districts of the north newcastle and manchester sheffield and nottingham he did his work effectually without a shot being fired rs est celare artem and just because of his success few observers realized from how great a danger the community had been preserved note his first wife whom he married in died in he married again in thus he had proved his versatile talents in regimental service in the peninsula in the reclamation of an eastern island from barbarism and in the control of disorder at home it was not till he had reached the age of sixty that he was to prove these gifts in the highest sphere in the handling of an army in the field and in the direction of a campaign but the offer of a command in india roused his indomitable spirit the more so as trouble was threatening on the northest frontier an illudged interference in afgh nist n had in caused the massacre near k bul of one british force other contingents were besieged in jal b and ghazni and were in danger of a similar fate and the prestige of british arms was at its lowest in the valley of the indus lord ellenborough the new viceroy turned to charles napier for advice and in april he was given the command in upper and lower sind the districts comprising the lower indus valley it was his first experience of india and his first command in war he was sixty years old and he had not faced an enemy army in the field since the age of twentyive as he said go to command in sind with no orders no instructions no precise line of policy given how many men are in sind how many soldiers to command no one knows they tell me i must form and model the staff of the army altogether feeling myself but an apprentice in indian matters i yet look in vain for a master but the years of study and preparation had not been in vain and responsibility never failed to call out his best qualities it was not many months before british officers and soldiers baluch chiefs and sindian peasants owned him as a master uch a master of the arts of war and peace as had not been seen on the indus since the days of alexander the great first like a true pupil of sir john moore he set to work thoroughly to drill his army he experimented in person with british muskets and mar th matchlocks and reassured his soldiers on the superiority of the former he experimented with rockets to test their efficiency and with his usual luck in the matter of wounds he had the calf of his leg badly torn by one that burst he would put his hand to any labour and his life to any risk if so he might stir the activity of others and promote the cause he convinced himself by studying the question at first hand that the baluch am rs who ruled the country were not only aliens but oppressors of the native peasantry not only illisposed to british policy but actively plotting with the hillribes beyond the indus and at the right moment he struck the danger of the situation lay in the great extent of the country in the difficulty of marching in such heat amid the sand and in the possibility of the am rs escaping from his grasp and taking refuge in fortresses in the heart of the desert believed to be inaccessible his first notable exploit was a march northwards one hundred miles into the desert to capture im mghar his last crowning a memorable sixteen days was a similar descent upon omarkot which lay one hundred miles eastward beyond rpur these raids involved the organization of a camel corps the carrying of water across the desert and the greatest hardships for the troops all of which charles napier shared uncomplainingly in person under his leadership british regiments and bombay sepoys alike did wonders who could complain for himself when he saw the spare frame of the old general his health undermined by fever and watches his hooked nose and flashing eye turned this way and that riding daily at their head prepared to stint himself of all but the barest necessaries and to share every peril he had begun the campaign in january the crowning success was won on april between these dates he fought two pitched battles at ni and dabo and completely broke the power of the am rs ni february was the most glorious day in his life with troops of whom barely were europeans he attacked an army variously estimated between and drawn up in a position which they had themselves chosen on the raised bank of a dry river bed the baluch seemed to have every advantage on their side but the british troops advancing in echelon from the right led by the nd regiment and developing an effective musketry fire fought their way up to the outer slope of the steep bank and held it for three hours here the nd with the two regiments of bombay sepoys on their left trusting chiefly to the bayonet but firing occasional volleys resisted the onslaught of baluch swordsmen in overwhelming numbers during nearly all this time the two lines were less than twenty yards apart and napier was conspicuous on horseback riding coolly along the front of the british line the matchlocks with which many of the baluch were armed seem to have been ineffective their national weapon was the sword the tribesmen were grand fighters but badly led they attacked in detachments with no concerted action for all that the british line frequently staggered under the weight of their courageous rushes and irregular firing went on across the narrow gap napier says expected death as much from our own men as from the enemy and i was much singed by our fire y whiskers twice or thrice so and my face peppered by fellows who in their fear fired over all heads but mine and nearly scattered my brains not even scarlett at balaclava had a more miraculous escape this exposure of his own person to risk was not due to mere recklessness in his days at the royal military college he had carefully considered the occasions when a commander must expose himself to get the best out of his men and from coru a to dabo he acted consistently on his principles early in the battle he had cleverly disposed his troops so as to neutralize in some measure the vast numerical superiority of the enemy his few guns were well placed and well served at a critical moment he ordered a charge of cavalry which broke the right of their position and threatened their camp but the issue had to be decided by hard fighting and all depended on the morale which was to carry the troops through such a punishing day the second battle was fought a month later at dabo near hyder b the most redoubtable of the am rs sher muhammad known as he lion of rpur had been gathering a force of his own and was only a few miles distant from ni when that battle was fought napier could have attacked him at once but to avoid bloodshed he was ready to negotiate he lion only used the respite to collect more troops and was soon defying the british with a force of men full of ardour despite their recent defeat indeed napier encouraged their confidence by spreading rumours of the terror prevailing in his own camp he did not wish to exhaust his men needlessly by long marches in tropical heat so he played a waiting game gathering reinforcements and trusting that the enemy would soon give him a chance of fighting this chance came on march and with a force of men and guns napier took another three hours to win his second battle and to drive sher muhammad from his position with the loss of killed the british losses were relatively trifling amounting to of whom belonged to the sorely tried nd regiment they were all full of confidence and fought splendidly under the general eye he lion himself escaped northwards and two months of hard marching and clever strategy were needed to prevent him stirring up trouble among the tribesmen the climate took toll of the british troops and even the general was for a time prostrated by sunstroke but the operations were successful and the last nucleus of an army was broken up by colonel jacob on june sher muhammad ended his days ignominiously at lahore then the capital of the sikhs having outlived his fame and sunk into idleness and debauchery thus in june the general could write in his diary e have taught the baluch that neither his sun nor his desert nor his jungles nor his nullahs can stop us he will never face us more but charles napier own work was far from being finished he had to bind together the different elements in the province to reconcile chieftain and peasant baluch hindu and sindian to living together in amity and submitting to british rule and he had to set up a framework of military and civilian officers to carry on the work he held firmly the principle that military rule must be temporary for the moment it was more effective but it was his business to prepare the new province for regular civil government as soon as was feasible he showed his ingenuity in the personal interviews which he had with the chieftains and the ascendancy which he won by his character was marked perhaps his qualities were such as could be more easily appreciated by orientals than by his own countrymen for he was impetuous selfeliant and autocratic in no common degree he was only one of a number of great englishmen of this century whose direct personal contact with eastern princes was worth scores of diplomatic letters and paper constitutions such men were henry lawrence john nicholson and charles gordon in them the power of great britain was incarnate in such a form as to strike the imagination and leave an ineffaceable impression many of the am rs wished to swear allegiance to a governor present in the flesh rather than to the distant queen beyond the sea so strongly were they impressed by napier personal character he did not forget his own countrymen least of all that valued friend homas atkins and his comrade the sepoy by the erection of spacious barracks he made the soldier life more pleasant and his health more secure and in a hundred other ways he showed his care and affection for them in return few british generals have been so loved by the rank and file he also gave much thought to material progress to strengthening the fortress of hyder b to developing the harbour at kar chi and above all to enriching the peasants by irrigation schemes it was the story of cephalonia on a bigger scale but napier was now twenty years older overwhelmed with work and he could give less attention to details he did his best to find subordinates after his own heart men who would corn delights and live laborious days oes he wear varnished boots was a typical question that he put to a friend in bombay when a new engineer was commended to him his own rewards were meagre the grand cross of the bath and the colonelcy of his favourite regiment the nd were all the recognition given for a campaign whose difficulties were minimized at home because he had mastered them so triumphantly two other achievements belong to the period of his government of sind the campaign against the tribes of the kachhi hills to the northest of his province rendered necessary by continued marauding shows all his old mastery of organization any one who has glanced into indian history knows the danger of these raids and the bitter experience which our indian army has gained in them in less than two months januaryarch napier had led five thousand men safely over burning deserts and through most difficult mountain country had by careful strategy driven the marauders into a corner forcing them to surrender with trifling loss and had made an impression on the hill chieftains which lasted for many a year this work though slighted by the directors of the company received enthusiastic praise from such good judges of war as lord hardinge and the duke of wellington the second emergency arose when the first sikh war broke out in the punjab napier felt so confident in the loyalty of his newlyacified province that within six weeks he drew together an army of men and took post at rohri ready to coperate against the sikhs from the south while lord hardinge advanced from the east before he could arrive the decisive battle had been fought and all he was asked to do was to assist in a council of war at lahore the mistakes made in the campaign had been numerous no one saw them more clearly than napier and no one foretold more accurately the troubles which were to follow for all that he wrote in generous admiration of lord hardinge the viceroy and lord gough the commandernhief at a time when criticism and personal bitterness were prevalent in many quarters after this he returned to sind with health shattered and a longing for rest he continued to work with vigour but his mind was set on resignation and the bad relations which had for years existed between him and the directors embittered his last months no doubt he was impatient and selfilled inclined to take short cuts through the system of dual control and to justify them by his own singleearted zeal for the good of the country but the directors had eyes for all the slight irregularities which are inevitable in the work of an original man and failed entirely to estimate the priceless services that he rendered to british rule in july he resigned and returned to europe but even now the end was not come he tragedy must be rected a year or two hence he had written in march seeing clearly that the sikhs had not been reconciled to british rule in february the directors were forced by the national voice to send him out to take supreme military command and to retrieve the disasters with which the second sikh war began they were very reluctant to do so and napier himself had little wish for further exertions in so thankless a service but the duke of wellington himself appealed to him the nation spoke through all its organs and he could not put his own wishes in the scale against the demands of public service note the dual control of british india by the crown and the east india company lasted from to he made all speed and reached calcutta early in may but he found no enemy to fight the issue had been decided by lord gough and the hard fighting of chili nw la he had been cheated by fortune as in and he never knew the joy of battle again he was accustomed to settle everything as a dictator he found it difficult to act as part of an administrative machine he was unfamiliar with the routine of indian official life and he was now growing old he was impatient of forms impetuous in his likes and dislikes outspoken in praise and condemnation his relations with the masterful viceroy lord dalhousie were soon clouded and though he delighted in the friendship of colin campbell and many other able soldiers he was too old to adapt himself to new men and new measures in the rumblings of the storm which was to break seven years later could already be heard and napier had much anxiety over the mutinous spirit rising in the sepoy regiments he did his best to go to the bottom of the trouble and to establish confidence and friendly relations between british and natives but he had not time enough to achieve permanent results and he was often fettered by the regulations of the political service his predictions were as striking now as in the first sikh war but he was not content to predict and to sit idle he was unwearied in working for the reform of barracks though his plans were often spoiled by the careless execution of others he was urgent for a better tone among regimental officers and for more consideration on their part towards their soldiers if more men in high position had similarly exerted themselves the mutiny would have been less widespread and less fatal his resignation was due to a dispute with lord dalhousie about the sepoys pay napier acted ultra vires in suspending on his own responsibility an order of the government because he believed the situation to be critical while the viceroy refused to regard this as justified his departure in december was the signal for an outburst of feeling among officers soldiers and all who knew him his return by way of sind was a triumphal progress he had two years to live when he set foot again in england and most of this was spent at oaklands near portsmouth his health had been ruined in the public service but he continued to take a keen interest in passing events and to write on military subjects to colin campbell and other friends at the same time he devoted much of his time to his neighbours and his farm in he attended as pallearer at the duke of wellington funeral his own was not far distant his brother sir william describes the last scene thus n the morning of august th at olock he expired like a soldier on a naked camp bedstead the windows of the room open and the fresh air of heaven blowing on his manly face s the last breath escaped montagu mcmurdo his sonna with a sudden inspiration snatched the old colours of the nd regiment the colour that had been borne at ni and hyder b and waved them over the dying hero thus charles napier passed from the world he was a man who roused enthusiastic devotion and provoked strong resentment like gordon he was a man who could rule others but could not be ruled and his official career left many hearturnings behind his equally passionate brother sir william who wrote his life took up the feud as a legacy and pursued it in print for many years it is regrettable that such men cannot work without friction but in all things it was devotion to the public service and not personal ambition that carried charles napier to such extremes from his youth he had trained himself to such a pitch of selfenial and ascetic rigour that he could not make allowance for the frailties of the average man his keen eye and swift brain made him too impatient of the shortcomings of conscientious officials he was ready to work fifteen hours a day when the need came he was able to pierce into the heart of a matter while others would be puzzling round the fringes of it rarely in his long and laborious career did an emergency arise capable of bringing out all his gifts and his greatest exploits were performed on scenes unfamiliar to the mass of his fellow countrymen but a few opinions can be given to show that he was rated at his full value by the foremost men of the day perhaps the most striking testimony comes from one who never saw him it was written three years after his death when his brother biography appeared it was carlyle the biographer of cromwell and frederick the great the most famous man of letters of the day who wrote in he fine and noble qualities of the man are very recognizable to me his piercing subtle intellect turned all to the practical giving him just insight into men and into things his inexhaustible adroit contrivances his fiery valour sharp promptitude to seize the good moment that will not return a lynxyed fiery man with the spirit of an old knight in him more of a hero than any modern i have seen for a long time a second tribute comes from one who had known him as an officer and was a supreme judge of military genius wellington was not given to extravagant words but on many occasions he expressed himself in the warmest terms about napier talents and services in speaking of the sind campaign in the house of lords he said y lords i must say that after giving the fullest consideration to these operations i have never known any instance of an officer who has shown in a higher degree that he possesses all the qualities and qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct great operations in the house of commons at the same time sir robert peel he ablest administrative statesman of that generation who had read for himself some of napier masterly dispatches aid o one ever doubted sir charles napier military powers but in his other character he does surprise me e is possessed of extraordinary talent for civil administration again he speaks of him as ne of three brothers who have engrafted on the stem of an ancient and honourable lineage that personal nobility which is derived from unblemished private character from the highest sense of personal honour and from repeated proofs of valour in the field which have made their name conspicuous in the records of their country indifferent as charles napier was to ordinary praise or blame he would have appreciated the words of such men especially when they associated him with his brothers but perhaps he would have been more pleased to know how many thousands of his humble fellow countrymen walked to his informal funeral at portsmouth and to know that the majority of those who subscribed to his statue in trafalgar square were private soldiers in the army that he had served and loved illustration lord shaftesbury from the

has suffered the same fate as many other words in our language it has become hackneyed and corrupted it has taken a professional taint it has almost become a byword we are apt to think of the philanthropist as an excitable contentious creature at the mercy of every fad an ultraadical in politics craving for notoriety filled with selfonfidence and meddling with other people business anthony ashley cooper the greatest philanthropist of the nineteenth century was of a different type by temper he was strongly conservative he always loved best to be among his own family he was fond of his home fond of the old associations of his house to come out into public life to take his place in parliament or on the platform to be mixed up in the wrangling of politics was naturally distasteful to him it continually needed a strong effort for him to overcome this distaste and to act up to his sense of duty it is only when we remember this that we can do justice to his lifelong activity and to the high principles which bore him up through so many efforts and so many disappointments for himself he would submit to injustice and be still for his fellow countrymen and for his religion he would renew the battle to the last day of his life his childhood was not happy his parents had little sympathy with children his father being absorbed in the cares of public life his mother given up to society pleasures he had three sisters older than himself but no brother or companion and he was left largely to himself at the age of seven he went to a preparatory school where he was made miserable by the many abuses which flourished there and it was not till he went to harrow at the age of twelve that he began to enjoy life he had few of the indulgences which we associate with the early days of those who are born heirs to high position but thus thrown back on himself the boy nurtured strong attachments for the old housekeeper who first showed him tenderness at home for the school where he had learnt to be happy and for the dorset home which was to be throughout his life the poletar of his affections the village of wimborne st giles lies some eight miles north of wimborne in dorset on the edge of cranborne forest one of the most beautiful and unspoiled regions in the south of england which s late as contained twelve thousand deer and as many as six lodges each of which had its walk and its ranger here he wandered freely in his holidays for many years giving as yet little promise of an exceptional career here you may find in outlying cottages those who still treasure his memory and keep his biography among the few books that adorn their shelves from harrow lord ashley went at the age of sixteen to read for two years with a clergyman in derbyshire in he went to christ church oxford and three years later succeeded in taking a first class in classics he had good abilities and a great power of concentration these were to bear fruit one day in the gathering of statistics in the marshalling of evidence and in the presentation of a case which needed the most lucid and most laborious advocacy he came down from oxford in but did not go into parliament till and for the intervening years there is little to chronicle in those days it was usual enough for a young nobleman to take up politics when he was barely of age but lord ashley needed some other motive than the custom of the day it is characteristic of his whole life that he responded to a call when there was a need but was never in a hurry to put himself forward or to aim at high position we have a few of his own notes from this time which show the extent of his reading and still more the depth of his reflections as with milton who spent over five years at cambridge and then five more in study and retirement at horton the long years of selfducation were profitable and left their mark on his life his first strong religious impulse he himself dates back to his schoolays at harrow when as is now recorded in a mural tablet on the spo in walking up the street one day he was shocked by the indignities of a pauper funeral the drunken bearers staggering up the hill and swearing over the coffin so appalled him that the sight remained branded on his memory and he determined to devote his life to the service of the poor but one such shock would have achieved little if the decision had not been strengthened by years of thought and resolution his tendency to selfriticism is seen in the entry in his diary for april his twentyifth birthda he blames himself for indulging in dreams and for having performed so little but he himself admits that the visions were all of a noble character and we know what abundant fruit they produced in the sixty years of active effort which were to follow the man who a year later could write sincerely in his diary has ceased to be a longing with me i desire to be useful in my generation had been little harmed by a few years of dreaming dreams and had little need to be afraid of having made a false start in life when he entered the house of commons as member for woodstock in lord ashley had strong conservative instincts a fervid belief in the british constitution and an unbounded admiration for the duke of wellington whose peninsula victories had fired his enthusiasm at harrow it was to his wing of the conservative party that ashley attached himself and it was the duke who succeeding to the premiership on the premature death of canning gave him his first office a post on the india board of control the east india company with its board of directors abolished in still ruled india but was since subject in many ways to the control of the british parliament and the board to which lord ashley now belonged exercised some of the functions since committed to the secretary of state for india he set himself conscientiously to study the interests of india but over the work of his department he had little chance of winning distinction in fact his first prominent speech was on the reform of lunatic asylums not an easy subject for a new member to handle he was diffident in manner and almost inaudible without the kindly encouragement of friends he might have despaired of future success but his sincerity in the cause was worth more than many a brilliant speech the bill was carried a new board was constituted and of this lord ashley became chairman in and continued to hold the office till his death fiftyix years later this was the first of the burdens that he took upon himself without thought of reward and so is worthy of special mention though it never won the fame of his factory legislation but it shows the character of the man how ready he was to step into a post which meant work without remuneration drudgery without fame prejudice and opposition from all whose interests were concerned in maintaining the abuses of the past it was this spirit which led him in to take up the church pastoral aid society in to found the indigent blind visiting society in to champion the cause of chimneyweeps and in all these cases to continue his support for fifty years or more we are accustomed toay to residents and atrons and a whole broadsheet of complimentary titles to which noblemen give their names and often give little else lord ashley understood such an office differently he was regular in attendance at meetings generous in giving money unflinching in his advocacy of the cause we shall see this more fully in dealing with the two most famous crusades associated with his name note to help church work by adding to the number of clergy though these growing labours began early to occupy his time we find the record of his life diversified by other claims and other interests in he married emily daughter of lord cowper who bore him several children and who shared all his interests with the fullest sympathy and henceforth his greatest joys and his deepest sorrows were always associated with his family life at home his first hobby was astronomy at the age of twentyight he was ardently devoted to it and would spend all his leisure on it for weeks together till graver duties absorbed his time but he was no recluse and all through his life he found pleasure in the society of his friends and in paying them visits in their homes many of his early visits were paid to the iron duke at strathfieldsaye in later life no one entertained him more often than lord palmerston with whom he was connected by marriage he was the friend and often the guest of queen victoria and in his twentyighth year he is even found as a guest at the festive board of george uch a round of laughing and pleasure i never enjoyed if there be a hospitable gentleman on earth it is his majesty and at all times he was ready to freely and on terms of social equality with all who shared his sympathies dukes and dustmen cabinet ministers and costermongers in the holiday season he delighted to travel in his journals he sets down the impressions which he felt among the pictures and churches of italy and in the mountains of germany and switzerland he loves to record the friendliness of the greetings which he met among the peasantry of various lands when he talked to them no one could fail to see that he was genuinely interested in them that he wanted to know their joys and their sorrows and to enrich his own knowledge by anything that the humblest could tell him still more did he delight in scotland where he had many friends he was of the generation immediately under the spell of the izard of the north and the whole country was seen through a veil of romantic and historical association there he went nearly every year to edinburgh to roslin to inveraray to the trossachs and to a hundred other places nd if his heart was stirred with the glories of the past his eye was quick to atch the manners living as they rise as he commented caustically at rome on he church lighted up and decorated like a balloom he bishop with a stout train of canons listening to the music precisely like an opera so at newbattle he criticizes the coldness of the kirk is silent save the minister who discharges the whole ceremony and labours under the weight of his own tautologies his bringing up had been in the anglican church he was devoted to her liturgy her congregational worship her moderation and simplicity combined with reverence and warmth although these travels were but interludes in his busy life they show that it was not for want of other tastes and interests of his own that his life was dedicated to laborious service he was very human himself and there were few aspects of humanity which did not attract him with his father relations were very difficult as his interest in social questions grew his attention was naturally turned on the poor nearest to his own doors the agricultural labourers of dorset even in those days of low wages dorset was a notorious example quoted on many a radical platform the wages of the farm labourers were frequently as low as seven shillings a week and the conditions in which they had often to bring up a large family of children were deplorable if lord ashley had not himself felt the shame of their poverty their bad housing and their other hardships there were plenty of opponents ready to force them on his notice in revenge for his having exposed their own sores he was made responsible for abuses which he could not remedy while his father a resolute tory of the old type still lived the son was unable to stir he sedulously tried to avoid all bitterness but he could not when publicly challenged avoid stating his own views about fair wages and fair conditions of living and his father took offence for years it was impossible for the son to come under his father roof when the old earl died in his son lost no time in proving his sincerity as a reformer but meanwhile he had to go into the fray against the manufacturers with his arms tied behind his back and submit to taunts which he little deserved that he could carry on this struggle for so many years without embittering the issues and without open exposure of the family quarrel shows the strength of character which he had gained by years of religious discipline and selfontrol politics proper played but a small part in his career the politicians found early that he was not of the vailable type hat he would not lend himself to party policy or compromise on any matter which seemed to him of national interest such political posts as were offered to him were largely held out as a bait to silence him and to prevent his bringing forward embarrassing measures which might split the party ashley himself found how much easier it was for him to follow a single course when he was an independent member reluctantly in he accepted a post at the board of admiralty and worked earnestly in his department but this ministry only lasted for one year and he never held office again though he was often pressed to do so he was attached to wellington but for peel now become the tory leader he had little love the two men were very dissimilar in character and though at times ashley had friendly communications with peel yet in his diary ashley often complains bitterly of his want of enthusiasm of what he regarded as peel opportunism and subservience to party policy the one had an instinct for what was practical and knew exactly how far he could combine interests to carry a measure the other was all on fire for the cause and ready to push it forward against all obstacles at all costs ashley it is true had to work through parliament to attain his chief ends and many a bitter moment he had to endure in striving towards the goal but if he was not an adroit or successful politician he gradually as the struggle went on by earnestness and force of character made for himself in the house a place apart a place of rare dignity and influence and with the force of public opinion behind him he was able to triumph over ministers and parties it was in that he first had his attention drawn to the conditions of labour in factories he never claimed to be the pioneer of the movement but he was early in the field the inventions of the latter part of the eighteenth century had transformed the north of england the demand for labour had given rise to appalling abuses especially in the matter of child labour from london workhouses and elsewhere children were poured into the labour market and by the system were bound to serve their masters for long periods and for long hours together a pretence of voluntary contract was kept up but fraud and deception were rife in the system and its results were tragic mrs browning famous poem he cry of the children gives a more vivid picture of the children sufferings than many pages of prose at the same time we have plenty of firstand evidence from the great towns of the misery which went along with the wonderful development of national wealth speaking in lord shaftesbury said ell can i recollect in the earlier periods of the factory movement waiting at the factory gates to see the children come out and a set of dejected cadaverous creatures they were in bradford especially the proofs of long and cruel toil were most remarkable the cripples and distorted forms might be numbered by hundreds perhaps by thousands a friend of mine collected together a vast number for me the sight was most piteous the deformities incredible and an eyeitness in bolton reports in nything like the squalid misery the slow mouldering putrefying death by which the weak and feeble are perishing here it never befell my eyes to behold nor my imagination to conceive some measures of relief were carried by the elder sir robert peel himself a cottonpinner but public opinion was slow to move and was not roused till when mr sadler member for newark led the first fight for a en hours bill when sadler was unseated in lord ashley offered his help and so embarked on the greatest of his works performed in the public service he had the support of a few of the noblest men in england including robert southey and charles dickens but he had against him the vast body of welloo people in the country and inside parliament many of the most progressive and influential politicians the factory owners were inspired at once by interest and conviction the political economy of the day taught them that all restrictions on labour were harmful to the progress of industry and to the prosperity of the country while the figures in their ledgers taught them what was the most economical method of running their own mills note see articles in n b on michael thomas sadler and on richard oastler already it was clear that lord ashley was no mere sentimentalist out for a momentary sensation at all times he gave the credit for starting the work to sadler and his associates and from the outset he urged his followers to fix on a limited measure first to concentrate attention on the work of children and young persons and to avoid general questions involving conflicts between capital and labour also he took endless pains to acquaint himself at first hand with the facts n factories he said afterwards examined the mills the machinery the homes and saw the workers and their work in all its details in collieries i went down into the pits in london i went into lodgingouses and thieves haunts and every filthy place it gave me a power i could not otherwise have had and this was years before lumming became fashionable and figured in the pages of punch it was no distraction caught up for a week or a month but a labour of fifty years we have an account of him as he appeared at this period of his life bove the medium height about feet inches with a slender and extremely graceful figure curling dark hair in thick masses fine brow features delicately cut the nose perhaps a trifle too prominent light blue eyes deeply set with projecting eyelids his mouth small and compressed his whole face and appearance seems to have had a sculpturesque effect and to have suggested the calm and composure of marble but under this marble exterior there was burning a flame of sympathy for the poor a fire of indignation against the system which oppressed them in some progress was made lord althorp the whig leader in the commons under pressure from lord ashley carried a bill dealing indeed with some of the worst abuses in factories but applying only to some of the great textile industries that it still left much to be done can be seen from studying the details of the measure children under eleven years of age were not to work more than nine hours a day and young persons under nineteen not more than twelve hours a day adults might still work all day and half the night if the temptation of misery at home and extra wages to be earned was too strong for them it seems difficult now to believe that this was a great step forward yet for the moment ashley found that he could do no more and must accept what the politicians gave him in however he started a fresh campaign on behalf of children not employed in these factories who were not included in the act of and who not being concentrated in the great centres of industry escaped the attention of the general public he obtained a royal commission to investigate mines and other works and to report upon their condition the blue book was published in and created a sensation unparalleled of its kind men read with horror the stories of the mines of children employed underground for twelve or fourteen hours a day crouching in low passages monotonously opening and shutting the trapoors as the trollies passed to and fro alone each child sat in pitchy darkness unable to stir for more than a few paces unable to sleep for fear of punishment with the strap in case of neglect and often surrounded with vermin women were employed crawling on hands and knees along these passages stripped to the waist stooping under the low roofs and even so chafing and wounding their backs as they hauled the coal along the underground rails or carrying in baskets on their backs up steps and ladders loads which varied in weight from a half to one and a half hundredweights the physical health the mental education and the moral character of these poor creatures suffered equally under such a system and well might those responsible for the existence of such abuses fear to let the report be published but copies of it first reached members of parliament then the public at large learnt the burden of the tale and lord ashley might now hope for enough support from outside to break down the opposition in the house of commons and the delays of parliamentary procedure he mines and collieries bill was brought in before the impression could fade and on june ashley made one of the greatest of his speeches and drove home powerfully the effect of the report his mastery of facts was clear enough to satisfy the most dispassionate politician his sincerity disarmed richard cobden the champion of the lancashire manufacturers and brought about a reconciliation between them his eloquence stirred the hearts of queen victoria and the prince consort and drew from the latter words of glowing admiration and promises of support in august the bill finally passed the house of lords and a second great blow had been struck practices which were poisoning at the source the lives of the younger generation were forbidden by law above all it was expressly laid down that after a few years no woman or girl should be employed in mines at all the influence which such a law had on the family life in the mining districts was incalculable the women were rescued from servitude in the mines and restored to their natural place at home there was still much to do in the factory question was again brought to the front by the demands of the working classes and again ashley was ready to champion their cause and to propose that the working day should now be limited to eight hours for children and to ten hours for grown men in parliament there was long and weary fighting over the details the tory government did not wish to oppose the bill directly neither party had really faced the question or made up its mind expediency rather than justice was in the minds of the official politicians such a straightforward champion as lord ashley was a source of embarrassment to these gentlemen to be met by evasion rather than direct opposition the radical john bright a strong opponent of state interference and equally straightforward in his methods made a personal attack on lord ashley he referred to the dorset labourers as if ashley was indifferent to abuses nearer home and left no one in doubt of his opinions at the same time sir james graham the home secretary did all in his power to defeat ashley bill by bringing forward alternative proposals which he knew would be unacceptable to the workers in face of such opposition most men would have given way ashley who had been a consistent tory all his life was bitterly aggrieved at the treatment which his bill met with from his official leaders he persevered in his efforts relying on support from outside but in parliament the government triumphed to the extent of defeating the ten hours bill in march and again in april still the small majority te by which this last division was decided showed in which direction the current was flowing and when a few months later the tories were ousted from office the whigs took up the bill officially and in june lord ashley though himself out of parliament for the moment had the satisfaction of seeing the bill become the law of the land there was great rejoicing in the manufacturing districts and lord ashley was the hero of the day the working classes had no direct representative in parliament in those days without his constant efforts neither party would have given a fair hearing to their cause he had argued with politicians without giving away principles he had stirred the industrial districts without rousing class hatred he had been defeated time after time without giving up the struggle much has been added since then to the laws restricting the conditions of labour till in the often quoted words of lord morley the biographer of cobden we have complete minute and voluminous code for the protection of labour an immense host of inspectors certifying surgeons and other authorities whose business it is to speed and post or land and ocean in restless guardianship of every kind of labour but these were the heroic days of the struggle for factory legislation and also of the struggle for cheap food for the people reviewing these great events many years later the duke of argyll said uring that period two great discoveries have been made in the science of government the one is the immense advantage of abolishing restrictions on trade the other is the absolute necessity of imposing restrictions on labour while sir robert peel might with some justice contest with cobden the honour of establishing the first principle few will challenge lord ashley right to the honour of securing the second of the many religious and political causes which he undertook during and after this time of the zionist movement to repatriate the jews of the establishing of a protestant bishopric at jerusalem of his attacks on the war with sind and the opium trade with china of his championship of the nestorian christians against the turk of his leadership of the great bible society there is not space to speak the mere list gives an idea of the width of his interests and the warmth of his sympathy some of these questions were highly contentious and lord ashley who was a fervent evangelical was less than fair to churchmen of other schools to dr pusey himself he could write a kindly and courteous letter but on the platform or in correspondence with friends he could denounce useyites in the roundest terms one cannot expect that a man of his character will avoid all mistakes it was a time when feeling ran high on religious questions and he was a declared partisan but at least we may say that the public good judged from the highest point was his objective there was no room for selfeeking in his heart nor did this wide extension of his activity mean neglect of his earlier crusades on the contrary he continued to work for the good of the classes to whom his factory bills had been so beneficial not content with prohibiting what was harmful he went on to positive measures of good restriction of hours was followed by sanitation and this again by education and by this he was led to what was perhaps the second most famous work of his life in his attention had already been drawn to the question of educating the neglected children and he was making acquaintance at first hand with the work of the ragged schools at that time few in number and poorly supported he visited repeatedly the field lane school in a district near holborn notoriously frequented by the criminal classes and soon the cause at which he was to work unsparingly for forty years began to move forward he went among the poor with no thought of condescension simple as he was by nature he possessed in perfection the art of speaking to children and he was soon full of practical schemes for helping them sanitary reform was not neglected in his zeal for religion and emigration was to be promoted as well as better housing at home for till the material conditions of life were improved he knew that it was idle to hope for much moral reform lain living and high thinking is an excellent ideal for those whose circumstances put them out of reach of anxiety over daily bread it is a difficult gospel to preach to those who are living in destitution and misery the character of his work soon won confidence even in the most unlikely quarters in june he received a roundobin signed by forty of the most notorious thieves in london asking him to come and meet them in person at a place appointed and on his going there he found a mob of nearly four hundred men all living by dishonesty and crime who listened readily and even eagerly to his brotherly words several of them came forward in turn and made candid avowal of their respective difficulties and vices and of the conditions of their lives he found that they were tired of their own way of life and were ready to make a fresh start and in the course of the next few months he was able thanks to the generosity of a rich friend to arrange for the majority of them to emigrate to another country or to find new openings away from their old haunts but apart from such special occasions the work of the schools went steadily forward in seven years more than a hundred such schools were opened and lord shaftesbury was unfailing in his attendance whenever he could help forward the cause his advice to the managers to the schools in the mire and the gutter sounds curious but he was afraid that as they throve boys of more prosperous classes would come in and drive out those for whom they were specially founded o long he said s the mire and gutter exist so long as this class exists you must keep the school adapted to their wants their feelings their tastes and their level and any of us familiar with the novels of charles dickens and walter besant will know that such boys still existed unprovided for in large numbers in and for many years after thus the years went by he succeeded to the earldom on his father death in his heart was wrung by the early deaths of two of his children and by the loss of his wife in in his home he had his full share of the joys and sorrows of life but his interest in his work never failed if new tasks were taken up it was not at the expense of the old the fresh demand on his unwearied energies was met with the same spirit at an advanced age he opened a new and attractive chapter in his life by his friendly meetings with the london costermongers he gave prizes for the bestept donkey he attended the judging in person he received in return a present of a donkey which was long cherished at wimborne st giles it is impossible to deal fully with his life in each decade one page from his journal for shows what he could still do at the age of eightyne and will be the best proof of his persistence in welloing he began the day with a visit to greenhithe to inspect the training ships for poor boys at midday he came back to grosvenor square to attend a committee meeting of the bible society at his home he then went to a public banquet in honour of his godson and he finished with a concert at buckingham palace thus keeping up his friendly relations with all classes in the realm to the very last in his eightyifth year he continued to attend a few meetings and to visit the scenes of his former labours and on october full of years and full of honours he died quietly at folkestone where he had gone for the sake of his health in this sketch attention has been drawn to his labours rather than to his honours he might have had plenty of the latter if he had wished he received the freedom of the city of london and of other great towns twice he was offered the garter and he only accepted the second offer on lord palmerston urgent request that he should treat it as a tribute to the importance of social work three times he was offered a seat in the cabinet but he refused each time because official position would fetter his special work he kept aloof from party politics and was only roused when great principles were at stake few of the leading politicians satisfied him peel seemed too cautious gladstone too subtle disraeli too insincere it was the simplicity and kindliness of his relative palmerston that won his heart rather than confidence in his policy at home or abroad the house of commons suited him better than the colder atmosphere of the house of lords but in neither did he rise to speak without diffidence and fear it is a great testimony to the force of his conviction that he won as many successes in parliament as he did but the means through which he effected his chief work were committees platform meetings and above all personal visits to scenes of distress the nation would gladly have given him the last tribute of burial in westminster abbey but he had expressed a clear wish to be laid among his own people at wimborne st giles and the funeral was as simple as he had wished it to be his name in london is rather incongruously associated with a fountain in piccadilly circus and with a street full of theatres made by the clearing of the slums where he had worked the intention was good the result is unfortunate more truly than in any sculpture or buildings his memorial is to be found in the altered lives of thousands of his fellow citizens in the happy looks of the children and in the pleasant homes and healthy workshops which have transformed the face of industrial england john lawrence born at richmond yorkshire march school at londonderry haileybury i s college goes

that our british isles have produced of this stock was john wesley who at the age of eightyive attributed his good health to rising every day at four and preaching every day at five of this was arthur wellesley who never knew defeat and ever lost a british gun of this was alexander lawrence sole survivor among the officers of the storming party at seringapatam who lived to rear seven stout sons five of whom went out to service in india two at least to win imperishable fame his wife a miss knox came also from across the sea and if the evidence fails to prove mr bosworth smith statement that she was akin to the great reformer she herself was a woman of strong character and great administrative talent when we remember john lawrence parentage we need not be surprised at the character which he bore nor at the evidence of it to be seen in the grand rugged features portrayed by watts in the picture in the national portrait gallery illustration lord lawrence from the painting by g f watts in the national portrait galler of these parents john laird mair lawrence was the fourth surviving son one boy the eldest having died in infancy he owed the accident of his birth in an english town to his father regiment being quartered at the time in yorkshire his first schooling at bristol to his father residence at clifton but when he was twelve years old he followed his elder brothers to londonderry where his maternal uncle the rev james knox was headmaster of the free grammar school situated within the walls of that famous protestant fortress it was a rough school of which the lawrence brothers cherished few kindly recollections it is difficult to ascertain what they learnt there perhaps the grim survivals of the past townalls bastions and guns made the deepest impression upon them john chief friend at school was robert montgomery whom many years later he welcomed as a sympathetic felloworker in india and the two boys continued their education together at wraxall in wiltshire to which they were transferred in here john spent two years working at his books by fits and starts and finding an outlet for his energy in climbing kitelying and other unconventional amusements and then his turn came to profit by the goodwill of a family friend who was an influential man and a director of the east india company to this man john huddlestone by name his brothers alexander and george owed their commissions in the indian cavalry while henry had elected for the artillery john hoped for a similar favour but was offered in its place a post in the indian civil service this was a cruel disappointment to him as he had set his heart on the army in fact he was only reconciled to the prospect by the influence of his eldest sister letitia who held a unique place as the family counsellor now and throughout her life when he sailed first for india at the age of eighteen john lawrence had done little to give promise of future distinction he had strong attachments to his mother and sister outside the family circle he was not eager to make new friends in his work and in his escapades he showed an independent spirit and seemed to care little what others thought of him even at haileybury at that time a trainingchool for the service of the east india company he was most irregular in his studies though he carried off several prizes and he seems to have impressed his fellows rather as an uncouth person who preferred mooning about the college or rambling alone through the countryide to spending his days in the pursuits which they esteemed when the time came for john lawrence to take up his work his brother henry his senior by five years was also going out to india to rejoin his company of artillery and the brothers sailed together john had to spend ten weary months in calcutta learning languages and was very unhappy there illealth was one cause another was his distaste for strangers society and his longing for home it was only the definite prospect of work which rescued him from despondency he applied for a post at delhi and as soon as this was granted he was all eagerness to leave calcutta but he had used the time well in one respect he had acquired the power of speaking persian with ease and fluency and this stood him in good stead in his dealings with the princes and the peasants of the northern races whose history he was to influence in the coming years delhi has been to many englishmen besides john lawrence a city of absorbing interest it had even then a long history behind it and its history as we in the twentieth century know is by no means finished yet it stands on the jumna the greatest tributary of the ganges at a point where the roads from the northest reach the vast fertile basin of these rivers full in the path of an invader many races had swept down on it from the mountain passes before the english soldiery appeared from the southast its mosques its palaces its gates recall the memory of many princes and conquerors at the time of lawrence arrival it was still the home of the heir of akbar and aurangzeb the last of the great mughals the dynasty had been left in after the wars of lord wellesley shorn of its power but not robbed of its dignity or riches as a result it had degenerated into an abuse of the first order since all the scoundrels of the district infested the palace and preyed upon its owner who had no work to occupy him no call of duty to rouse him from sloth and sensuality the town was filled with a turbulent population of many different tribes and the work of the european officials was exacting and difficult but at the same time it gave unique opportunities for an able man to learn the complexity of the indian problem and the knowledge which john lawrence acquired there proved of incalculable value to him when he was called to higher posts at delhi he was working as an assistant to the resident one of a staff of four or five with no independent authority but in he was given temporary charge of the district of p n pat fifty miles to the north and it is here that we begin to get some measure of the man and his abilities the place was the scene of more than one famous battle in the past armies of mughals and persians and mar th s had swept across its plains its present inhabitants were j ts a race widely extended through the eastern punjab and the western part of the province of agra originally invaders from the north they espoused the religions of those around them some brahman some muhammadan some sikh and settled down as thrifty industrious peasants though inclined to peaceful pursuits they still preserved some strength of character and were the kind of people among whom lawrence might hope to enjoy his work the duties of the magistrate are generally divided into judicial and financial but as an old indian official more exhaustively stated it verything which is done by the executive government is done by the collector in one or another of his capacities ublican auctioneer sheriff roadaker timberealer recruiting sergeant slayer of wild beasts bookseller cattlereeder postmaster vaccinator discounter of bills and registrar it is difficult to see how one can bring all these departments under two headings it is still more difficult to see how such diverse demands can possibly be met by a single official especially by one little over twenty years of age coming from a distant country no staytome fitting himself snugly into a niche in the wellanned offices of whitehall can expect to see his powers develop so rapidly or so rapidly collapse whichever be his fat as these solitary outposts of our empire bearing atlasike a whole world on their shoulders with john lawrence fortunately there was no question of collapse till many years of overwork broke down his physical strength he grappled with the task like a giant passing long days in his office or in the saddle looking into everything for himself laying up stores of knowledge about land tenure and agriculture training his judgement to deal with the still more difficult problem of the workings of the oriental mind he had no friends or colleagues of his own at hand and when the day work was done he would spend his evenings holding an informal durbar outside his tent chatting with all and sundry of the natives who happened to be there the peoples of india are familiar with pomp and outward show such as we do not see in the more prosaic west but they also know a man when they see one and this young man with the stronglyarked features curt speech and masterful manner sitting there alone in shirtleeves and old trousers as he listened to their tales was an embodiment of the british rule which they learnt to respect f not to love or the solid benefits which it conferred upon them he had an element of hardness in him by many he was thought to be unduly harsh at different periods of his life but he spared no trouble to learn the truth he was inflexibly just in his decisions and his reputation spread rapidly throughout the district in cases of genuine need he could be extremely kind and generous but he did not lavish these qualities on the first comer nor did he wear his heart upon his sleeve his informal ways and unconventional dress were a bugbear to some critics his old waywardness and love of adventure was still alive in him and he thoroughly enjoyed the more irregular sides of his work mr bosworth smith has preserved some capital stories of the crimes with which he had to deal and how the young collector took an active part in arresting the criminals tories which some years later the future viceroy dictated to his wife but after two years thus spent in constant activity and everrowing mastery of his work he had to come down in rank the post was filled by a permanent official and john lawrence returned to the delhi staff as an assistant he soon received other cting appointments in the neighbourhood of delhi one of which at et wa gave him valuable experience in dealing with the difficult revenue question the government was in the habit of collecting the land tax from the yot or peasant through a class of middleen called alukd rs who had existed under the native princes for a long time borrowing perhaps from western ideas the english had regarded the latter as landowners and the peasants as mere tenants this had often caused grave injustice to the latter and the officials now desired to revise the settlement in order to put all classes on a fair footing in this department robert bird was supreme and under his direction john lawrence and others set themselves to measure out areas to record the nature of the various soils and to assess rents at a moderate rate still this was dull work compared to the planning of practical improvements and the conviction of dangerous criminals and as towards the end of lawrence was struck down by a bad attack of fever he was not sorry to be ordered home on long leave and to revisit his native land he had been strenuously at work for ten years on end and he had well earned a holiday note alukd r in the northest am nd r in bengal his father was now dead and his favourite sister married but of his mother he was for many years the chief support contributing liberally of his own funds and giving his time and judgement to managing what the brothers put together for that purpose in he was travelling both in scotland and ireland and it was near londonderry that he met his future wife daughter of the rev richard hamilton who besides being rector of his parish was an active justice of the peace he met her again in the following summer and they were married on august their life together was a tale of unbroken happiness which was only ended by his death a long tour on the continent was followed by a severe illness which threatened to forbid all prospect of work in india however by the end of that summer he had recovered his health enough to contemplate returning and in october he set sail to spend another sixteen years in labouring in india in he resumed work at delhi holding temporary posts till the end of when he became in his own right collector and magistrate of delhi and p n pat this time his position besides involving much familiar work threw him in the way of events of wider interest lord hardinge the governoreneral on his way to the first sikh war came to delhi and was much impressed with lawrence ability and when he annexed the do b of j landhar and wanted a governor for it he could find no one more suitable than the young magistrate who had so swiftly collected carts and sent them up laden with supplies on the eve of the battle of sobraon note o b land between two rivers this was a great step in advance and carried john lawrence ahead of many of his seniors but it was promotion that was fully justified by events he was not wanting in selfonfidence and the tone of some of his letters to the secretary at headuarters might seem boastful had not his whole career shown that he could more than make good his promise o far as i am concerned as supervisor he says could easily manage double the extent of country and then comparing his district with another he continues only ask you to wait six months and then contrast the civil management of the two charges as a fact during the three years that he held this post he was often acting as deputy for his brother henry at lahore during his illness or absence and this alone clears him of the charge of idle boasting j landhar was comparatively a simple job for him whatever it might be for others he was able to apply his knowledge of assessment and taxation gained at et wa and need only satisfy himself at lahore on the other hand he had to consider the very strong views held by his brother about the respect due to the vested rights of the chiefs and he studiously set himself to deal with matters in the way in which his brother would have done the sirdars or sikh chieftains had inherited traditions of corrupt and oppressive rule but the chivalrous henry lawrence always looked at the noble side of native character and as by his personal gifts he was able to inspire devotion so he could draw out what was good in those who came under his influence the cooler and more practical john looked at both sides at the traditions good and evil which came to them from their forefathers and he considered carefully how these chiefs would act when not under his immediate influence above all he looked to the prosperity and happiness of the millions of peasants out of sight who toiled laboriously to get a living from the land the second sikh war which broke out in can only be treated here so far as it affected the fortunes of the lawrences lord gough strategical blunders redeemed by splendid courage give it great military interest but it was the new viceroy lord dalhousie who decided the fate of the punjab he was a very able hardorking scotch nobleman who devoted himself to his work in india for eight years with such selfacrifice that he returned home in already doomed to an early death but he was masterful and selfonfident to a degree and against his imperious will the impulsive forces of charles napier and henry lawrence broke like waves on a granite coast he was not blind to their exceptional gifts but to him the wide knowledge coolness and judgement of john lawrence made a greater appeal and when after the victory of chili nw la and the submission of the sikh army in he annexed the punjab he decided to rule it by a board and not by a single governor and to direct the diverse talents of the brothers to a common end he could not dispense with henry influence among the sikh chieftains and john knowledge of civil government was of equal value each would to a certain extent have his department but a vast number of questions would have to be decided jointly by the board of which the third member from was their old schoolfellow and friend robert montgomery the friction which resulted was often intolerable without the least personal animosity the brothers were forced into frequent conflicts of opinion each was convinced of the justice of his attitude and most unwilling to sacrifice the interests of those in whom he was especially interested after three years of the strain lord dalhousie decided that it was time to put the country under a single ruler for the honour of being first chief commissioner of the punjab he chose the younger brother and sir henry was given the post of agent in r jput na from which he was promoted in to be the first governor of oudh it was a tragic parting the ablest men in the punjab like john nicholson and herbert edwardes regarded sir henry as a father and many felt that it would be impossible to continue their work without him no englishman in india made such an impression by personal influence on both europeans and asiatics as a wellnown english statesman said is character was far above his career distinguished as that career was but there is little doubt now that for the development of the new province lord dalhousie made the right choice and there is no higher proof of the magnanimity of john lawrence than the way in which he won the respect and retained the services of the most ardent supporters of his brother his dealings with nicholson alone would fill a chapter few lessons are more instructive than the way in which he controlled the waywardness of this heroic but selfilled officer while giving full scope to his singular abilities the tale of john lawrence government of the punjab is in some measure a repetition of his work at p n pat and delhi it had the same variety it was carried out with the same thoroughness but on this vast field it was impossible for him to see everything for himself while directing the policy he had to work largely through others and to leave many important decisions to his subordinates the quality of the punjab officials f men who owed their inspiration to henry lawrence or to john or to both of them as proved in many fields of government during the next thirty years soldiers on the frontier passes judges and revenue officers on the plains all worked with a will and contributed of their best the punjab is from many points of view the most interesting province in india its motley population chiefly musalm ns but including sikhs and other hindus its extremes of heat and cold of rich alluvial soil and barren deserts its vast waterupplies largely running to waste its great frontier ramparts with the historic passes ach of these gave rise to its own special problems it is impossible to deal with so complex a subject here all that we can do is to indicate a few sides of the work by which john lawrence had so developed the provinces within the short period of eight years that it was able to bear the strain of the mutiny and to prove a source of strength and not of weakness he put the right men in the right places and supported them with all his power he broke up the old sikh army and reorganized the forces in such a way as to weaken tribal feeling and make it less easy for them to combine against us he so administered justice that the natives came to know that an english official word was as good as his bond and with the aid of robert napier and others he so helped forward irrigation as to redeem the waste places and develop the latent wealth of the country in all these years he had little recognition or reward his chief lord dalhousie valued his work and induced the government to make him k b in but to the general public at home he was still unknown in the crisis came the greased cartridges were an immediate cause there were others in the background the sepoy regiments were too largely recruited from one race the poorbeas of the northest province and they were too numerous in proportion to the europeans vanity greed superstition fear all influenced their minds fortunately they produced no leader of ability and where the british officials were prompt and firm the sparks of rebellion were swiftly stamped out montgomery at lahore edwardes at pesh war and many others did their part nobly and disarmed whole regiments without bloodshed but at meerut and cawnpore there was hesitation rebellion raised its head encouragement was given to a hundred local discontents little rills flowed together from all directions and finally two great streams of rebellion surged round delhi and lucknow the latter where henry lawrence met a hero death in july does not here concern us but the reduction of delhi was chiefly the work of john lawrence and its effect on the history of the mutiny was profound he might well have been afraid for the punjab won by conquest from the most military race in india only eight years before lying on the borders of our old enemy afgh nist n garrisoned by europeans and about native troops it might seem a sufficient achievement to preserve his province to british rule with rebellion raging all around and making inroads far within its borders but as soon as he had secured the vital points in his own province mult n pesh war lahor john lawrence devoted himself to a single task to recover delhi directing against it every man and gun and all the stores that the punjab could spare many of his subordinates brave men though they were were alarmed to see the punjab so denuded and exposed to risks but we now see the strength of character and determination of the man who swayed the fortunes of the north he knew the importance of delhi of its geographical position and its imperial traditions and he felt sure that no more vital blow could be struck at the mutiny than to win back the city the effort might seem hopeless the military commanders might hesitate the small force encamped on the historic ridge to the west of the town might seem to be besieged rather than besiegers but continuous waves of energy from the punjab reinforced them one day it was he guides marching miles in twentywo days or some other european regiment hastening from some hotbed of fanaticism where it could ill be spared another day it was a train of siege artillery skilfully piloted across rivers and past ambushes lastly it was the famous moving column led by john nicholson in person which restored the fortunes of the day through june july august and half of september the operations dragged wearily on but thanks to the exertions of baird smith and alexander taylor the chief engineers an assault was at last judged to be feasible after days of street fighting the british secured control of the whole city on september th and nicholson who was fatally wounded in the assault lived long enough to hear the tale of victory without aid from england this great triumph had been won by the resources of the punjab and great was the moral effect of the news as it spread through the bazaars this success did not exhaust lawrence energy for months after he continued to help sir colin campbell in his operations against lucknow and to correspond with the viceroy lord canning and others about the needs of the time more perhaps than any one else he laboured to check savage reprisals and needless brutality and thereby incurred much odium with the more reckless and ignorant officers who coming out after the most critical hour talked loudly about punishment and revenge he was as cool in victory as he had been firm in the hour of disaster and never ceased to look ahead to rebuilding the shaken edifice on sounder foundations when the danger should be past it was only in the autumn of when the ship of state was again in smooth water that he began to think of a holiday for himself he had worked continuously for sixteen years his health was not so strong as of old and he could not safely continue at his post he received a baronetcy and the grand cross of the bath from the crown while the company recognized his great services by conferring on him a pension of a year from these heroic scenes it is difficult to pass to the humdrum life in england the receptions at windsor the parties in london and the discussions on the indian council he himself though not indifferent to honourable recognition of his wor found far more pleasure in the quiet days passed in the home circle the games of croquet on his lawn and the occasional travels in scotland and ireland four years of repose were none too long for other demands were soon to be made upon him when lord elgin died suddenly in john lawrence received the offer of the highest post under the crown and before the end of the year he was sailing for calcutta as governoreneral of india in some ways he was able to fill the place without great effort he had never been a respecter of persons he had been quite indifferent whether his decisions were approved by those about him and had always learnt to walk alone with a single eye to the public good also he had such vast store of knowledge of the land and its inhabitants as no viceroy before him for many decades but the ceremonial fatigued him and the tradition of working n council as the viceroy must was embarrassing to one who could always form a decision alone and had learnt to trust his own judgement many of lawrence best friends and most trusted colleagues had left india and he had seated at his council board others who did not share his views and who opposed the measures that he advocated especially was this true of the distinguished soldier sir hugh rose and lawrence had to endure the same strain as in in the days of the punjab board but he was able to do great service to the country in many ways and especially to the agricultural classes by pushing forward large schemes of irrigation finance was one of his strong points and any expenditure which would be reproductive was sure of his support owing to his care for the peasants and his love of a sound budget the period of his viceroyalty was what is generally called uneventful hat is it was chiefly given up to such schemes as promoted peace and prosperity and did not witness any extension of our dominions even when robert napier expedition went to abyssinia few people in england realized that it was organized in india and paid for by india and the credit for its success was given elsewhere note created lord napier of magdala after storming king theodore fortress in but it is necessary to refer to one great subject of controversy which was prominent all through lawrence career and with which his name is associated this is the rontier policy and the treatment of afgh nist n on which two distinct schools of thought emerged one school ever jealous of the russian advance maintained that our indian government should establish agencies in afgh nist n with or without the consent of the am r that it should interfere if need be to secure the throne for a prince who was attached to us that british troops should be stationed beyond the indus where they could make their influence felt beyond our borders the other maintained that our best policy was to keep within our natural boundaries and in this respect the indus with its fringe of desert was second only to the high mountain chains that we should recognize the wild love of independence which the afgh ns felt that we should undertake no obligations towards the am r except to observe the boundaries between him and us if the russians threatened our territories through afgh nist n the natives would help us from hatred of the invaders but if we began to establish agents and troops in their towns we should ourselves become to them the hated enemy one school said that the afgh ns respected strength and would support us if we seemed capable of a vigorous policy the other replied that they resented foreign intrusion and would oppose great britain or russia if either attempted it one said that we ought to have a resident in k bul and kandah r the other said that it was a pity that we had ever occupied pesh war in its exposed valley at the foot of the khyber pass and that attock where the indus was bridged was the ideal frontier post no one doubted that lawrence would be found on the side of the less showy and less costly policy and he kept unswervingly true to his ideal the verdict of history must not be claimed too confidently in a land which has seen so many races come and go at least it may be said that the men who advocated advance were unable to make it good few chapters in our history are more tragic than the afgh n wars of and though the last was redeemed by general roberts great achievements our present policy is in accord with this verdict there is toay no british agency at k bul or kandah r and the loyalty of the am rs during some forty years of faithful adherence on our part to this policy have been sufficiently firm to justify lawrence opposition to the forward policy toay it seems easy to vindicate his wisdom but in when the conservative government kindled the war fever and allowed lord lytton to initiate a new adventure it was not easy to stem the tide and lawrence came in for much abuse and unpopularity in maintaining the other view but long before this happened he had returned to england his term of office was over early in and his work in india was finished his last years at home were quiet but not inactive in he was invited to become the first chairman of the new school board for london and he held this office three years board work was always uncongenial to him and the subject was of course unfamiliar but he gave his best efforts to the cause and did other voluntary work in london this came to an end in when his eyesight failed and for nearly two years he had much suffering and was in danger of total blindness for a time a second operation saved him from this and in he put forth his strength in writing and speaking vigorously but without success against lord lytton afgh n war in june he was stricken with sudden illness and died a week later in his seventieth year it was hardly to be expected that one who had spent himself so freely amid such stirring events should live beyond the psalmist span of life he had started at the bottom of the official ladder by his own efforts he had won his way to the top and his career will always be a notable example to those young englishmen who cross the sea to serve the empire in our great dependency with its million inhabitants how the relations between india and great britain will develop ow long the connexion will last may be debated by politicians and authors it is in careers like that of john lawrence and there were many such in

from the early days of the roman republic and even in rome the tribunate was unlike all other magistracies the holder had no outward signs of office no satellites to execute his commands no definite department to administer like the consul or the praetor it was his first function to protest on behalf of the poorer citizens against the violent exercise of authority and on certain occasions to thwart the action of other magistrates he was to be the champion of the weak and helpless against the privileged orders and his power depended on his courage his eloquence and the prestige of his office england has no office of the sort in her constitutional armoury but the word ribune expresses better than any other title the position occupied in our political life by many of the men who have been the conspicuous champions of liberty and few would contest the claim of john bright to a foremost place among them he too stood forth to vindicate the rights of the plebs he too resisted the will

painting by w w ouless in the national portrait galler his early life gave little promise of a great career he was born in the son of jacob bright of rochdale who had risen by his own efforts to the

was the one which he attended last lying among the moors on the borders of lancashire and yorkshire in the river hodder he learnt to swim still more he learnt to fish and it was fishing which remained his favourite outdoor pastime throughout his life when schoolays were over t the age of fifteen here was no question of the university a rigorous life awaited him and he began at once to work in his father business the mill stood close beside his father house at greenbank near rochdale some ten miles northward from manchester and had been built in by jacob bright out of a capital lent to him by two members of the society of friends here he received bales of new cotton by canal or from carriers span it in his mill and gave out the warp and weft thus manufactured to handloom weavers whom he paid by the piece to weave it in the weaving chamber at the top of their own houses he then sold the fully manufactured article in manchester or elsewhere in such surroundings many a clever boy has developed into a hardeaded prosperous business man material interests have cased in his soul and he has been content to limit his thoughts to buying and selling to the affairs of his factory and his town and he has heard no call to other fields of work but john bright education in books and in life was only just beginning and though it may be regrettable that he missed the leisured freedom of university life we must own that he really made good the loss by his own effort and that without neglecting the work of the mil and thereby did much to strengthen the independence of his character in
