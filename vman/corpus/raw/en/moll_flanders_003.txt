the window and was standing at it for some air when i saw three gentlemen come by on horseback and go into an inn just against us it was not to be concealed nor was it so doubtful as to leave me any room to question it but the second of the three was my lancashire husband i was frightened to death i never was in such a consternation in my life i though i should have sunk into the ground my blood ran chill in my veins and i trembled as if i had been in a cold fit of ague i say there was no room to question the truth of it i knew his clothes i knew his horse and i knew his face the first sensible reflect i made was that my husband was not by to see my disorder and that i was very glad of it the gentlemen had not been long in the house but they came to the window of their room as is usual but my window was shut you may be sure however i could not keep from peeping at them and there i saw him again heard him call out to one of the servants of the house for something he wanted and received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person that were possible to be had my next concern was to know if possible what was his business there but that was impossible sometimes my imagination formed an idea of one frightful thing sometimes of another sometimes i thought he had discovered me and was come to upbraid me with ingratitude and breach of honour and every moment i fancied he was coming up the stairs to insult me and innumerable fancies came into my head of what was never in his head nor ever could be unless the devil had revealed it to him i remained in this fright nearly two hours and scarce ever kept my eye from the window or door of the inn where they were at last hearing a great clatter in the passage of their inn i ran to the window and to my great satisfaction saw them all three go out again and travel on westward had they gone towards london i should have been still in a fright lest i should meet him on the road again and that he should know me but he went the contrary way and so i was eased of that disorder we resolved to be going the next day but about six o clock at night we were alarmed with a great uproar in the street and people riding as if they had been out of their wits and what was it but a huendry after three highwaymen that had robbed two coaches and some other travellers near dunstable hill and notice had it seems been given that they had been seen at brickhill at such a house meaning the house where those gentlemen had been the house was immediately beset and searched but there were witnesses enough that the gentlemen had been gone over three hours the crowd having gathered about we had the news presently and i was heartily concerned now another way i presently told the people of the house that i durst to say those were not the persons for that i knew one of the gentlemen to be a very honest person and of a good estate in lancashire the constable who came with the huendry was immediately informed of this and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth and i assured him that i saw the three gentlemen as i was at the window that i saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in that i saw them afterwards take horse and i could assure him i knew one of them to be such a man that he was a gentleman of a very good estate and an undoubted character in lancashire from whence i was just now upon my journey the assurance with which i delivered this gave the mob gentry a check and gave the constable such satisfaction that he immediately sounded a retreat told his people these were not the men but that he had an account they were very honest gentlemen and so they went all back again what the truth of the matter was i knew not but certain it was that the coaches were robbed at dunstable hill and in money taken besides some of the lace merchants that always travel that way had been visited too as to the three gentlemen that remains to be explained hereafter well this alarm stopped us another day though my spouse was for travelling and told me that it was always safest travelling after a robbery for that the thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when they had alarmed the country but i was afraid and uneasy and indeed principally lest my old acquaintance should be upon the road still and should chance to see me i never lived four pleasanter days together in my life i was a mere bride all this while and my new spouse strove to make me entirely easy in everything oh could this state of life have continued how had all my past troubles been forgot and my future sorrows avoided but i had a past life of a most wretched kind to account for some of it in this world as well as in another we came away the fifth day and my landlord because he saw me uneasy mounted himself his son and three honest country fellows with good firearms and without telling us of it followed the coach and would see us safe into dunstable we could do no less than treat them very handsomely at dunstable which cost my spouse about ten or twelve shillings and something he gave the men for their time too but my landlord would take nothing for himself this was the most happy contrivance for me that could have fallen out for had i come to london unmarried i must either have come to him for the first night s entertainment or have discovered to him that i had not one acquaintance in the whole city of london that could receive a poor bride for the first night s lodging with her spouse but now being an old married woman i made no scruple of going directly home with him and there i took possession at once of a house well furnished and a husband in very good circumstances so that i had a prospect of a very happy life if i knew how to manage it and i had leisure to consider of the real value of the life i was likely to live how different it was to be from the loose ungoverned part i had acted before and how much happier a life of virtue and sobriety is than that which we call a life of pleasure oh had this particular scene of life lasted or had i learned from that time i enjoyed it to have tasted the true sweetness of it and had i not fallen into that poverty which is the sure bane of virtue how happy had i been not only here but perhaps for ever for while i lived thus i was really a penitent for all my life past i looked back on it with abhorrence and might truly be said to hate myself for it i often reflected how my lover at the bath struck at the hand of god repented and abandoned me and refused to see me any more though he loved me to an extreme but i prompted by that worst of devils poverty returned to the vile practice and made the advantage of what they call a handsome face to be the relief to my necessities and beauty be a pimp to vice now i seemed landed in a safe harbour after the stormy voyage of life past was at an end and i began to be thankful for my deliverance i sat many an hour by myself and wept over the remembrance of past follies and the dreadful extravagances of a wicked life and sometimes i flattered myself that i had sincerely repented but there are temptations which it is not in the power of human nature to resist and few know what would be their case if driven to the same exigencies as covetousness is the root of all evil so poverty is i believe the worst of all snares but i waive that discourse till i come to an experiment i lived with this husband with the utmost tranquillity he was a quiet sensible sober man virtuous modest sincere and in his business diligent and just his business was in a narrow compass and his income sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way i do not say to keep an equipage and make a figure as the world calls it nor did i expect it or desire it for as i abhorred the levity and extravagance of my former life so i chose now to live retired frugal and within ourselves i kept no company made no visits minded my family and obliged my husband and this kind of life became a pleasure to me we lived in an uninterrupted course of ease and content for five years when a sudden blow from an almost invisible hand blasted all my happiness and turned me out into the world in a condition the reverse of all that had been before it my husband having trusted one of his fellowlerks with a sum of money too much for our fortunes to bear the loss of the clerk failed and the loss fell very heavy on my husband yet it was not so great neither but that if he had had spirit and courage to have looked his misfortunes in the face his credit was so good that as i told him he would easily recover it for to sink under trouble is to double the weight and he that will die in it shall die in it it was in vain to speak comfortably to him the wound had sunk too deep it was a stab that touched the vitals he grew melancholy and disconsolate and from thence lethargic and died i foresaw the blow and was extremely oppressed in my mind for i saw evidently that if he died i was undone i had had two children by him and no more for to tell the truth it began to be time for me to leave bearing children for i was now eightndorty and i suppose if he had lived i should have had no more i was now left in a dismal and disconsolate case indeed and in several things worse than ever first it was past the flourishing time with me when i might expect to be courted for a mistress that agreeable part had declined some time and the ruins only appeared of what had been and that which was worse than all this that i was the most dejected disconsolate creature alive i that had encouraged my husband and endeavoured to support his spirits under his trouble could not support my own i wanted that spirit in trouble which i told him was so necessary to him for bearing the burthen but my case was indeed deplorable for i was left perfectly friendless and helpless and the loss my husband had sustained had reduced his circumstances so low that though indeed i was not in debt yet i could easily foresee that what was left would not support me long that while it wasted daily for subsistence i had not way to increase it one shilling so that it would be soon all spent and then i saw nothing before me but the utmost distress and this represented itself so lively to my thoughts that it seemed as if it was come before it was really very near also my very apprehensions doubled the misery for i fancied every sixpence that i paid for a loaf of bread was the last that i had in the world and that toorrow i was to fast and be starved to death in this distress i had no assistant no friend to comfort or advise me i sat and cried and tormented myself night and day wringing my hands and sometimes raving like a distracted woman and indeed i have often wondered it had not affected my reason for i had the vapours to such a degree that my understanding was sometimes quite lost in fancies and imaginations i lived two years in this dismal condition wasting that little i had weeping continually over my dismal circumstances and as it were only bleeding to death without the least hope or prospect of help from god or man and now i had cried too long and so often that tears were as i might say exhausted and i began to be desperate for i grew poor apace for a little relief i had put off my house and took lodgings and as i was reducing my living so i sold off most of my goods which put a little money in my pocket and i lived near a year upon that spending very sparingly and eking things out to the utmost but still when i looked before me my very heart would sink within me at the inevitable approach of misery and want oh let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the circumstances of a desolate state and how they would grapple with mere want of friends and want of bread it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only but of looking up to heaven for support and of the wise man s prayer give me not poverty lest i steal let them remember that a time of distress is a time of dreadful temptation and all the strength to resist is taken away poverty presses the soul is made desperate by distress and what can be done it was one evening when being brought as i may say to the last gasp i think i may truly say i was distracted and raving when prompted by i know not what spirit and as it were doing i did not know what or why i dressed me for i had still pretty good clothe and went out i am very sure i had no manner of design in my head when i went out i neither knew nor considered where to go or on what business but as the devil carried me out and laid his bait for me so he brought me to be sure to the place for i knew not whither i was going or what i did wandering thus about i knew not whither i passed by an apothecary s shop in leadenhall street when i saw lie on a stool just before the counter a little bundle wrapped in a white cloth beyond it stood a maidervant with her back to it looking towards the top of the shop where the apothecary s apprentice as i suppose was standing upon the counter with his back also to the door and a candle in his hand looking and reaching up to the upper shelf for something he wanted so that both were engaged mighty earnestly and nobody else in the shop this was the bait and the devil who i said laid the snare as readily prompted me as if he had spoke for i remember and shall never forget it twas like a voice spoken to me over my shoulder take the bundle be quick do it this moment it was no sooner said but i stepped into the shop and with my back to the wench as if i had stood up for a cart that was going by i put my hand behind me and took the bundle and went off with it the maid or the fellow not perceiving me or any one else it is impossible to express the horror of my soul all the while i did it when i went away i had no heart to run or scarce to mend my pace i crossed the street indeed and went down the first turning i came to and i think it was a street that went through into fenchurch street from thence i crossed and turned through so many ways and turnings that i could never tell which way it was not where i went for i felt not the ground i stepped on and the farther i was out of danger the faster i went till tired and out of breath i was forced to sit down on a little bench at a door and then i began to recover and found i was got into thames street near billingsgate i rested me a little and went on my blood was all in a fire my heart beat as if i was in a sudden fright in short i was under such a surprise that i still knew not wither i was going or what to do after i had tired myself thus with walking a long way about and so eagerly i began to consider and make home to my lodging where i came about nine o clock at night when the bundle was made up for or on what occasion laid where i found it i knew not but when i came to open it i found there was a suit of childbedinen in it very good and almost new the lace very fine there was a silver porringer of a pint a small silver mug and six spoons with some other linen a good smock and three silk handkerchiefs and in the mug wrapped up in a paper s in money all the while i was opening these things i was under such dreadful impressions of fear and i such terror of mind though i was perfectly safe that i cannot express the manner of it i sat me down and cried most vehemently lord said i what am i now a thief why i shall be taken next time and be carried to newgate and be tried for my life and with that i cried again a long time and i am sure as poor as i was if i had durst for fear i would certainly have carried the things back again but that went off after a while well i went to bed for that night but slept little the horror of the fact was upon my mind and i knew not what i said or did all night and all the next day then i was impatient to hear some news of the loss and would fain know how it was whether they were a poor body s goods or a rich perhaps said i it may be some poor widow like me that had packed up these goods to go and sell them for a little bread for herself and a poor child and are now starving and breaking their hearts for want of that little they would have fetched and this thought tormented me worse than all the rest for three or four days time but my own distresses silenced all these reflections and the prospect of my own starving which grew every day more frightful to me hardened my heart by degrees it was then particularly heavy upon my mind that i had been reformed and had as i hoped repented of all my past wickedness that i had lived a sober grave retired life for several years but now i should be driven by the dreadful necessity of my circumstances to the gates of destruction soul and body and two or three times i fell upon my knees praying to god as well as i could for deliverance but i cannot but say my prayers had no hope in them i knew not what to do it was all fear without and dark within and i reflected on my past life as not sincerely repented of that heaven was now beginning to punish me on this side the grave and would make me as miserable as i had been wicked had i gone on here i had perhaps been a true penitent but i had an evil counsellor within and he was continually prompting me to relieve myself by the worst means so one evening he tempted me again by the same wicked impulse that had said take that bundle to go out again and seek for what might happen i went out now by daylight and wandered about i knew not whither and in search of i knew not what when the devil put a snare in my way of a dreadful nature indeed and such a one as i have never had before or since going through aldersgate street there was a pretty little child who had been at a dancingchool and was going home all alone and my prompter like a true devil set me upon this innocent creature i talked to it and it prattled to me again and i took it by the hand and led it along till i came to a paved alley that goes into bartholomew close and i led it in there the child said that was not its way home i said yes my dear it is i show you the way home the child had a little necklace on of gold beads and i had my eye upon that and in the dark of the alley i stooped pretending to mend the child s clog that was loose and took off her necklace and the child never felt it and so led the child on again here i say the devil put me upon killing the child in the dark alley that it might not cry but the very thought frighted me so that i was ready to drop down but i turned the child about and bade it go back again for that was not its way home the child said so she would and i went through into bartholomew close and then turned round to another passage that goes into st john street then crossing into smithfield went down chick lane and into field lane to holborn bridge when mixing with the crowd of people usually passing there it was not possible to have been found out and thus i enterprised my second sally into the world the thoughts of this booty put out all the thoughts of the first and the reflections i had made wore quickly off poverty as i have said hardened my heart and my own necessities made me regardless of anything the last affair left no great concern upon me for as i did the poor child no harm i only said to myself i had given the parents a just reproof for their negligence in leaving the poor little lamb to come home by itself and it would teach them to take more care of it another time this string of beads was worth about twelve or fourteen pounds i suppose it might have been formerly the mother s for it was too big for the child s wear but that perhaps the vanity of the mother to have her child look fine at the dancingchool had made her let the child wear it and no doubt the child had a maid sent to take care of it but she careless jade was taken up perhaps with some fellow that had met her by the way and so the poor baby wandered till it fell into my hands however i did the child no harm i did not so much as fright it for i had a great many tender thoughts about me yet and did nothing but what as i may say mere necessity drove me to i had a great many adventures after this but i was young in the business and did not know how to manage otherwise than as the devil put things into my head and indeed he was seldom backward to me one adventure i had which was very lucky to me i was going through lombard street in the dusk of the evening just by the end of three king court when on a sudden comes a fellow running by me as swift as lightning and throws a bundle that was in his hand just behind me as i stood up against the corner of the house at the turning into the alley just as he threw it in he said god bless you mistress let it lie there a little and away he runs swift as the wind after him comes two more and immediately a young fellow without his hat crying stop thief and after him two or three more they pursued the two last fellows so close that they were forced to drop what they had got and one of them was taken into the bargain and other got off free i stood stocktill all this while till they came back dragging the poor fellow they had taken and lugging the things they had found extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the booty and taken the thief and thus they passed by me for i looked only like one who stood up while the crowd was gone once or twice i asked what was the matter but the people neglected answering me and i was not very importunate but after the crowd was wholly past i took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away this indeed i did with less disturbance than i had done formerly for these things i did not steal but they were stolen to my hand i got safe to my lodgings with this cargo which was a piece of fine black lustring silk and a piece of velvet the latter was but part of a piece of about eleven yards the former was a whole piece of near fifty yards it seems it was a mercer s shop that they had rifled i say rifled because the goods were so considerable that they had lost for the goods that they recovered were pretty many and i believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk how they came to get so many i could not tell but as i had only robbed the thief i made no scruple at taking these goods and being very glad of them too i had pretty good luck thus far and i made several adventures more though with but small purchase yet with good success but i went in daily dread that some mischief would befall me and that i should certainly come to be hanged at last the impression this made on me was too strong to be slighted and it kept me from making attempts that for ought i knew might have been very safely performed but one thing i cannot omit which was a bait to me many a day i walked frequently out into the villages round the town to see if nothing would fall in my way there and going by a house near stepney i saw on the windowoard two rings one a small diamond ring and the other a gold ring to be sure laid there by some thoughtless lady that had more money then forecast perhaps only till she washed her hands i walked several times by the window to observe if i could see whether there was anybody in the room or no and i could see nobody but still i was not sure it came presently into my thoughts to rap at the glass as if i wanted to speak with somebody and if anybody was there they would be sure to come to the window and then i would tell them to remove those rings for that i had seen two suspicious fellows take notice of them this was a ready thought i rapped once or twice and nobody came when seeing the coast clear i thrust hard against the square of the glass and broke it with very little noise and took out the two rings and walked away with them very safe the diamond ring was worth about and the other about s i was now at a loss for a market for my goods and especially for my two pieces of silk i was very loth to dispose of them for a trifle as the poor unhappy thieves in general do who after they have ventured their lives for perhaps a thing of value are fain to sell it for a song when they have done but i was resolved i would not do thus whatever shift i made unless i was driven to the last extremity however i did not well know what course to take at last i resolved to go to my old governess and acquaint myself with her again i had punctually supplied the a year to her for my little boy as long as i was able but at last was obliged to put a stop to it however i had written a letter to her wherein i had told her that my circumstances were reduced very low that i had lost my husband and that i was not able to do it any longer and so begged that the poor child might not suffer too much for its mother s misfortunes i now made her a visit and i found that she drove something of the old trade still but that she was not in such flourishing circumstances as before for she had been sued by a certain gentleman who had had his daughter stolen from him and who it seems she had helped to convey away and it was very narrowly that she escaped the gallows the expense also had ravaged her and she was become very poor her house was but meanly furnished and she was not in such repute for her practice as before however she stood upon her legs as they say and as she was a stirring bustling woman and had some stock left she was turned pawnbroker and lived pretty well she received me very civilly and with her usual obliging manner told me she would not have the less respect for me for my being reduced that she had taken care my boy was very well looked after though i could not pay for him and that the woman that had him was easy so that i needed not to trouble myself about him till i might be better able to do it effectually i told her that i had not much money left but that i had some things that were money s worth if she could tell me how i might turn them into money she asked me what it was i had i pulled out the string of gold beads and told her it was one of my husband s presents to me then i showed her the two parcels of silk which i told her i had from ireland and brought up to town with me and the little diamond ring as to the small parcel of plate and spoons i had found means to dispose of them myself before and as for the childbedinen i had she offered me to take it herself believing it to have been my own she told me that she was turned pawnbroker and that she would sell those things for me as pawn to her and so she sent presently for proper agents that bought them being in her hands without any scruple and gave good prices too i now began to think this necessary woman might help me a little in my low condition to some business for i would gladly have turned my hand to any honest employment if i could have got it but here she was deficient honest business did not come within her reach if i had been younger perhaps she might have helped me to a spark but my thoughts were off that kind of livelihood as being quite out of the way after fifty which was my case and so i told her she invited me at last to come and be at her house till i could find something to do and it should cost me very little and this i gladly accepted of and now living a little easier i entered into some measures to have my little son by my last husband taken off and this she made easy too reserving a payment only of a year if i could pay it this was such a help to me that for a good while i left off the wicked trade that i had so newly taken up and gladly i would have got my bread by the help of my needle if i could have got work but that was very hard to do for one that had no manner of acquaintance in the world however at last i got some quilting work for ladies beds petticoats and the like and this i liked very well and worked very hard and with this i began to live but the diligent devil who resolved i should continue in his service continually prompted me to go out and take a walk that is to say to see if anything would offer in the old way one evening i blindly obeyed his summons and fetched a long circuit through the streets but met with no purchase and came home very weary and empty but not content with that i went out the next evening too when going by an alehouse i saw the door of a little room open next the very street and on the table a silver tankard things much in use in publicouses at that time it seems some company had been drinking there and the careless boys had forgot to take it away i went into the box frankly and setting the silver tankard on the corner of the bench i sat down before it and knocked with my foot a boy came presently and i bade him fetch me a pint of warm ale for it was cold weather the boy ran and i heard him go down the cellar to draw the ale while the boy was gone another boy came into the room and cried ye call i spoke with a melancholy air and said no child the boy is gone for a pint of ale for me while i sat here i heard the woman in the bar say are they all gone in the five which was the box i sat in and the boy said yes who fetched the tankard away says the woman i did says another boy that s it pointing it seems to another tankard which he had fetched from another box by mistake or else it must be that the rogue forgot that he had not brought it in which certainly he had not i heard all this much to my satisfaction for i found plainly that the tankard was not missed and yet they concluded it was fetched away so i drank my ale called to pay and as i went away i said take care of your plate child meaning a silver pint mug which he brought me drink in the boy said yes madam very welcome and away i came i came home to my governess and now i thought it was a time to try her that if i might be put to the necessity of being exposed she might offer me some assistance when i had been at home some time and had an opportunity of talking to her i told her i had a secret of the greatest consequence in the world to commit to her if she had respect enough for me to keep it a secret she told me she had kept one of my secrets faithfully why should i doubt her keeping another i told her the strangest thing in the world had befallen me and that it had made a thief of me even without any design and so told her the whole story of the tankard and have you brought it away with you my dear says she to be sure i have says i and showed it her but what shall i do now says i must not carry it again carry it again says she ay if you are minded to be sent to newgate for stealing it why says i they can t be so base to stop me when i carry it to them again you don t know those sort of people child says she they not only carry you to newgate but hang you too without any regard to the honesty of returning it or bring in an account of all the other tankards they have lost for you to pay for what must i do then says i nay says she as you have played the cunning part and stole it you must e en keep it there s no going back now besides child says she don t you want it more than they do i wish you could light of such a bargain once a week this gave me a new notion of my governess and that since she was turned pawnbroker she had a sort of people about her that were none of the honest ones that i had met with there before i had not been long there but i discovered it more plainly than before for every now and then i saw hilts of swords spoons forks tankards and all such kind of ware brought in not to be pawned but to be sold downright and she bought everything that came without asking any questions but had very good bargains as i found by her discourse i found also that in following this trade she always melted down the plate she bought that it might not be challenged and she came to me and told me one morning that she was going to melt and if i would she would put my tankard in that it might not be seen by anybody i told her with all my heart so she weighed it and allowed me the full value in silver again but i found she did not do the same to the rest of her customers some time after this as i was at work and very melancholy she begins to ask me what the matter was as she was used to do i told her my heart was heavy i had little work and nothing to live on and knew not what course to take she laughed and told me i must go out again and try my fortune it might be that i might meet with another piece of plate o mother says i that is a trade i have no skill in and if i should be taken i am undone at once says she i could help you to a schoolmistress that shall make you as dexterous as herself i trembled at that proposal for hitherto i had had no confederates nor any acquaintance among that tribe but she conquered all my modesty and all my fears and in a little time by the help of this confederate i grew as impudent a thief and as dexterous as ever moll cutpurse was though if fame does not belie her not half so handsome the comrade she helped me to dealt in three sorts of craft viz shoplifting stealing of shopooks and pocketooks and taking off gold watches from the ladies sides and this last she did so dexterously that no woman ever arrived to the performance of that art so as to do it like her i liked the first and the last of these things very well and i attended her some time in the practice just as a deputy attends a midwife without any pay at length she put me to practice she had shown me her art and i had several times unhooked a watch from her own side with great dexterity at last she showed me a prize and this was a young lady big with child who had a charming watch the thing was to be done as she came out of church she goes on one side of the lady and pretends just as she came to the steps to fall and fell against the lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright and both cried out terribly in the very moment that she jostled the lady i had hold of the watch and holding it the right way the start she gave drew the hook out and she never felt it i made off immediately and left my schoolmistress to come out of her pretended fright gradually and the lady too and presently the watch was missed ay says my comrade then it was those rogues that thrust me down i warrant ye i wonder the gentlewoman did not miss her watch before then we might have taken them she humoured the thing so well that nobody suspected her and i was got home a full hour before her this was my first adventure in company the watch was indeed a very fine one and had a great many trinkets about it and my governess allowed us for it of which i had half and thus i was entered a complete thief hardened to the pitch above all the reflections of conscience or modesty and to a degree which i must acknowledge i never thought possible in me thus the devil who began by the help of an irresistible poverty to push me into this wickedness brought me on to a height beyond the common rate even when my necessities were not so great or the prospect of my misery so terrifying for i had now got into a little vein of work and as i was not at a loss to handle my needle it was very probable as acquaintance came in i might have got my bread honestly enough i must say that if such a prospect of work had presented itself at first when i began to feel the approach of my miserable circumstances i say had such a prospect of getting my bread by working presented itself then i had never fallen into this wicked trade or into such a wicked gang as i was now embarked with but practice had hardened me and i grew audacious to the last degree and the more so because i had carried it on so long and had never been taken for in a word my new partner in wickedness and i went on together so long without being ever detected that we not only grew bold but we grew rich and we had at one time onendwenty gold watches in our hands i remember that one day being a little more serious than ordinary and finding i had so good a stock beforehand as i had for i had near in money for my share it came strongly into my mind no doubt from some kind spirit if such there be that at first poverty excited me and my distresses drove me to these dreadful shifts so seeing those distresses were now relieved and i could also get something towards a maintenance by working and had so good a bank to support me why should i now not leave off as they say while i was well that i could not expect to go always free and if i was once surprised and miscarried i was undone this was doubtless the happy minute when if i had hearkened to the blessed hint from whatsoever had it came i had still a cast for an easy life but my fate was otherwise determined the busy devil that so industriously drew me in had too fast hold of me to let me go back but as poverty brought me into the mire so avarice kept me in till there was no going back as to the arguments which my reason dictated for persuading me to lay down avarice stepped in and said go on go on you have had very good luck go on till you have gotten four or five hundred pounds and then you shall leave off and then you may live easy without working at all thus i that was once in the devil s clutches was held fast there as with a charm and had no power to go without the circle till i was engulfed in labyrinths of trouble too great to get out at all however these thoughts left some impression upon me and made me act with some more caution than before and more than my directors used for themselves my comrade as i called her but rather she should have been called my teacher with another of her scholars was the first in the misfortune for happening to be upon the hunt for purchase they made an attempt upon a linenraper in cheapside but were snapped by a hawk syed journeyman and seized with two pieces of cambric which were taken also upon them this was enough to lodge them both in newgate where they had the misfortune to have some of their former sins brought to remembrance two other indictments being brought against them and the facts being proved upon them they were both condemned to die they both pleaded their bellies and were both voted quick with child though my tutoress was no more with child than i was i went frequently to see them and condole with them expecting that it would be my turn next but the place gave me so much horror reflecting that it was the place of my unhappy birth and of my mother s misfortunes and that i could not bear it so i was forced to leave off going to see them and oh could i have but taken warning by their disasters i had been happy still for i was yet free and had nothing brought against me but it could not be my measure was not yet filled up my comrade having the brand of an old offender was executed the young offender was spared having obtained a reprieve but lay starving a long while in prison till at last she got her name into what they call a circuit pardon and so came off this terrible example of my comrade frighted me heartily and for a good while i made no excursions but one night in the neighbourhood of my governess s house they cried fire my governess looked out for we were all up and cried immediately that such a gentlewoman s house was all of a light fire atop and so indeed it was here she gives me a job now child says she there is a rare opportunity for the fire being so near that you may go to it before the street is blocked up with the crowd she presently gave me my cue go child says she to the house and run in and tell the lady or anybody you see that you come to help them and that you came from such a gentlewoman that is one of her acquaintance farther up the stree she gave me the like cue to the next house naming another name that was also an acquaintance of the gentlewoman of the house away i went and coming to the house i found them all in confusion you may be sure i ran in and finding one of the maids lord sweetheart says i how came this dismal accident where is your mistress any how does she do is she safe and where are the children i come from madam to help you away runs the maid madam madam says she screaming as loud as she could yell here is a gentlewoman come from madam to help us the poor woman half out of her wits with a bundle under her arm an two little children comes toward me lord madam says i let me carry the poor children to madam she desires you to send them she take care of the poor lambs and immediately i takes one of them out of her hand and she lifts the other up into my arms ay do for god s sake says she carry them to her oh thank her for her kindness have you anything else to secure madam says i she will take care of it oh dear ay says she god bless her and thank her take this bundle of plate and carry it to her too oh she is a good woman oh lord we are utterly ruined utterly undone and away she runs from me out of her wits and the maids after her and away comes i with the two children and the bundle i was no sooner got into the street but i saw another woman come to me oh says she mistress in a piteous tone you will let fall the child come this is a sad time let me help you and immediately lays hold of my bundle to carry it for me no says i if you will help me take the child by the hand and lead it for me but to the upper end of the street i go with you and satisfy you for your pains she could not avoid going after what i said but the creature in short was one of the same business with me and wanted nothing but the bundle however she went with me to the door for she could not help it when we were come there i whispered her go child said i i understand your trade you may meet with purchase enough she understood me and walked off i thundered at the door with the children and as the people were raised before by the noise of the fire i was soon let in and i said is madam awake pray tell her mrs desires the favour of her to take the two children in poor lady she will be undone their house is all of a flame they took the children in very civilly pitied the family in distress and away came i with my bundle one of the maids asked me if i was not to leave the bundle too i said no sweetheart tis to go to another place it does not belong to them i was a great way out of the hurry now and so i went on clear of anybody s inquiry and brought the bundle of plate which was very considerable straight home and gave it to my old governess she told me she would not look into it but bade me go out again to look for more she gave me the like cue to the gentlewoman of the next house to that which was on fire and i did my endeavour to go but by this time the alarm of fire was so great and so many engines playing and the street so thronged with people that i could not get near the house whatever i would do so i came back again to my governess s and taking the bundle up into my chamber i began to examine it it is with horror that i tell what a treasure i found there tis enough to say that besides most of the family plate which was considerable i found a gold chain an oldashioned thing the locket of which was broken so that i suppose it had not been used some years but the gold was not the worse for that also a little box of buryingings the lady s weddinging and some broken bits of old lockets of gold a gold watch and a purse with about value in old pieces of gold coin and several other things of value this was the greatest and the worst prize that ever i was concerned in for indeed though as i have said above i was hardened now beyond the power of all reflection in other cases yet it really touched me to the very soul when i looked into this treasure to think of the poor disconsolate gentlewoman who had lost so much by the fire besides and who would think to be sure that she had saved her plate and best things how she would be surprised and afflicted when she should find that she had been deceived and should find that the person that took her children and her goods had not come as was pretended from the gentlewoman in the next street but that the children had been put upon her without her own knowledge i say i confess the inhumanity of this action moved me very much and made me relent exceedingly and tears stood in my eyes upon that subject but with all my sense of its being cruel and inhuman i could never find in my heart to make any restitution the reflection wore off and i began quickly to forget the circumstances that attended the taking them nor was this all for though by this job i was become considerably richer than before yet the resolution i had formerly taken of leaving off this horrid trade when i had gotten a little more did not return but i must still get farther and more and the avarice joined so with the success that i had no more thought of coming to a timely alteration of life though without it i could expect no safety no tranquillity in the possession of what i had so wickedly gained but a little more and a little more was the case still at length yielding to the importunities of my crime i cast off all remorse and repentance and all the reflections on that head turned to no more than this that i might perhaps come to have one booty more that might complete my desires but though i certainly had that one booty yet every hit looked towards another and was so encouraging to me to go on with the trade that i had no gust to the thought of laying it down in this condition hardened by success and resolving to go on i fell into the snare in which i was appointed to meet with my last reward for this kind of life but even this was not yet for i met with several successful adventures more in this way of being undone i remained still with my governess who was for a while really concerned for the misfortune of my comrade that had been hanged and who it seems knew enough of my governess to have sent her the same way and which made her very uneasy indeed she was in a very great fright it is true that when she was gone and had not opened mouth to tell what she knew my governess was easy as to that point and perhaps glad she was hanged for it was in her power to have obtained a pardon at the expense of her friends but on the other hand the loss of her and the sense of her kindness in not making her market of what she knew moved my governess to mourn very sincerely for her i comforted her as well as i could and she in return hardened me to merit more completely the same fate however as i have said it made me the more wary and particularly i was very shy of shoplifting especially among the mercers and drapers who are a set of fellows that have their eyes very much about them i made a venture or two among the lace folks and the milliners and particularly at one shop where i got notice of two young women who were newly set up and had not been bred to the trade there i think i carried off a piece of boneace worth six or seven pounds and a paper of thread but this was but once it was a trick that would not serve again it was always reckoned a safe job when we heard of a new shop and especially when the people were such as were not bred to shops such may depend upon it that they will be visited once or twice at their beginning and they must be very sharp indeed if they can prevent it i made another adventure or two but they were but trifles too though sufficient to live on after this nothing considerable offering for a good while i began to think that i must give over the trade in earnest but my governess who was not willing to lose me and expected great things of me brought me one day into company with a young woman and a fellow that went for her husband though as it appeared afterwards she was not his wife but they were partners it seems in the trade they carried on and partners in something else in short they robbed together lay together were taken together and at last were hanged together i came into a kind of league with these two by the help of my governess and they carried me out into three or four adventures where i rather saw them commit some coarse and unhandy robberies in which nothing but a great stock of impudence on their side and gross negligence on the people s side who were robbed could have made them successful so i resolved from that time forward to be very cautious how i adventured upon anything with them and indeed when two or three unlucky projects were proposed by them i declined the offer and persuaded them against it one time they particularly proposed robbing a watchmaker of three gold watches which they had eyed in the daytime and found the place where he laid them one of them had so many keys of all kinds that he made no question to open the place where the watchmaker had laid them and so we made a kind of an appointment but when i came to look narrowly into the thing i found they proposed breaking open the house and this as a thing out of my way i would not embark in so they went without me they did get into the house by main force and broke up the locked place where the watches were but found but one of the gold watches and a silver one which they took and got out of the house again very clear but the family being alarmed cried out thieves and the man was pursued and taken the young woman had got off too but unhappily was stopped at a distance and the watches found upon her and thus i had a second escape for they were convicted and both hanged being old offenders though but young people as i said before that they robbed together and lay together so now they hanged together and there ended my new partnership i began now to be very wary having so narrowly escaped a scouring and having such an example before me but i had a new tempter who prompted me every day i mean my governess and now a prize presented which as it came by her management so she expected a good share of the booty there was a good quantity of flanders lace lodged in a private house where she had gotten intelligence of it and flanders lace being prohibited it was a good booty to any customouse officer that could come at it i had a full account from my governess as well of the quantity as of the very place where it was concealed and i went to a customouse officer and told him i had such a discovery to make to him of such a quantity of lace if he would assure me that i should have my due share of the reward this was so just an offer that nothing could be fairer so he agreed and taking a constable and me with him we beset the house as i told him i could go directly to the place he left it to me and the hole being very dark i squeezed myself into it with a candle in my hand and so reached the pieces out to him taking care as i gave him some so to secure as much about myself as i could conveniently dispose of there was near worth of lace in the hole and i secured about worth of it to myself the people of the house were not owners of the lace but a merchant who had entrusted them with it so that they were not so surprised as i thought they would be i left the officer overjoyed with his prize and fully satisfied with what he had got and appointed to meet him at a house of his own directing where i came after i had disposed of the cargo i had about me of which he had not the least suspicion when i came to him he began to capitulate with me believing i did not understand the right i had to a share in the prize and would fain have put me off with but i let him know that i was not so ignorant as he supposed i was and yet i was glad too that he offered to bring me to a certainty i asked and he rose up to i fell to and he rose again to in a word he offered and i consented only demanding a piece of lace which i thought came to about or as if it had been for my own wear and he agreed to it so i got in money paid me that same night and made an end of the bargain nor did he ever know who i was or where to inquire for me so that if it had been discovered that part of the goods were embezzled he could have made no challenge upon me for it i very punctually divided this spoil with my governess and i passed with her from this time for a very dexterous manager in the nicest cases i found that this last was the best and easiest sort of work that was in my way and i made it my business to inquire out prohibited goods and after buying some usually betrayed them but none of these discoveries amounted to anything considerable not like that i related just now but i was willing to act safe and was still cautious of running the great risks which i found others did and in which they miscarried every day the next thing of moment was an attempt at a gentlewoman s good watch it happened in a crowd at a meetingouse where i was in very great danger of being taken i had full hold of her watch but giving a great jostle as if somebody had thrust me against her and in the juncture giving the watch a fair pull i found it would not come so i let it go that moment and cried out as if i had been killed that somebody had trod upon my foot and that there were certainly pickpockets there for somebody or other had given a pull at my watch for you are to observe that on these adventures we always went very well dressed and i had very good clothes on and a gold watch by my side as like a lady as other fold i had no sooner said so but the other gentlewoman cried out a pickpocket too for somebody she said had tried to pull her watch away when i touched her watch i was close to her but when i cried out i stopped as it were short and the crowd bearing her forward a little she made a noise too but it was at some distance from me so that she did not in the least suspect me but when she cried out a pickpocket somebody cried ay and here has been another this gentlewoman has been attempted too at that very instance a little farther in the crowd and very luckily too they cried out a pickpocket again and really seized a young fellow in the very act this though unhappy for the wretch was very opportunely for my case though i had carried it off handsomely enough before but now it was out of doubt and all the loose part of the crowd ran that way and the poor boy was delivered up to the rage of the street which is a cruelty i need not describe and which however they are always glad of rather than to be sent to newgate where they lie often a long time till they are almost perished and sometimes they are hanged and the best they can look for if they are convicted is to be transported this was a narrow escape to me and i was so frighted that i ventured no more at gold watches a great while there was indeed a great many concurring circumstances in this adventure which assisted to my escape but the chief was that the woman whose watch i had pulled at was a fool that is to say she was ignorant of the nature of the attempt which one would have thought she should not have been seeing she was wise enough to fasten her watch so that it could not be slipped up but she was in such a fright that she had no thought about her proper for the discovery for she when she felt the pull screamed out and pushed herself forward and put all the people about her into disorder but said not a word of her watch or of a pickpocket for at least two minutes time which was time enough for me and to spare for as i had cried out behind her as i have said and bore myself back in the crowd as she bore forward there were several people at least seven or eight the throng being still moving on that were got between me and her in that time and then i crying out a pickpocket rather sooner than she or at least as soon she might as well be the person suspected as i and the people were confused in their inquiry whereas had she with a presence of mind needful on such an occasion as soon as she felt the pull not screamed out as she did but turned immediately round and seized the next body that was behind her she had infallibly taken me this is a direction not of the kindest sort to the fraternity but tis certainly a key to the clue of a pickpocket s motions and whoever can follow it will as certainly catch the thief as he will be sure to miss if he does not i had another adventure which puts this matter out of doubt and which may be an instruction for posterity in the case of a pickpocket my good old governess to give a short touch at her history though she had left off the trade was as i may say born a pickpocket and as i understood afterwards had run through all the several degrees of that art and yet had never been taken but once when she was so grossly detected that she was convicted and ordered to be transported but being a woman of a rare tongue and withal having money in her pocket she found means the ship putting into ireland for provisions to get on shore there where she lived and practised her old trade for some years when falling into another sort of bad company she turned midwife and procuress and played a hundred pranks there which she gave me a little history of in confidence between us as we grew more intimate and it was to this wicked creature that i owed all the art and dexterity i arrived to in which there were few that ever went beyond me or that practised so long without any misfortune it was after those adventures in ireland and when she was pretty well known in that country that she left dublin and came over to england where the time of her transportation being not expired she left her former trade for fear of falling into bad hands again for then she was sure to have gone to wreck here she set up the same trade she had followed in ireland in which she soon by her admirable management and good tongue arrived to the height which i have already described and indeed began to be rich though her trade fell off again afterwards as i have hinted before i mentioned thus much of the history of this woman here the better to account for the concern she had in the wicked life i was now leading into all the particulars of which she led me as it were by the hand and gave me such directions and i so well followed them that i grew the greatest artist of my time and worked myself out of every danger with such dexterity that when several more of my comrades ran themselves into newgate presently and by that time they had been half a year at the trade i had now practised upwards of five years and the people at newgate did not so much as know me they had heard much of me indeed and often expected me there but i always got off though many times in the extremest danger one of the greatest dangers i was now in was that i was too well known among the trade and some of them whose hatred was owing rather to envy than any injury i had done them began to be angry that i should always escape when they were always catched and hurried to newgate these were they that gave me the name of moll flanders for it was no more of affinity with my real name or with any of the name i had ever gone by than black is of kin to white except that once as before i called myself mrs flanders when i sheltered myself in the mint but that these rogues never knew nor could i ever learn how they came to give me the name or what the occasion of it was i was soon informed that some of these who were gotten fast into newgate had vowed to impeach me and as i knew that two or three of them were but too able to do it i was under a great concern about it and kept within doors for a good while but my governess whom i always made partner in my success and who now played a sure game with me for that she had a share of the gain and no share in the hazard i say my governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless unprofitable life as she called it and she laid a new contrivance for my going abroad and this was to dress me up in men s clothes and so put me into a new kind of practice i was tall and personable but a little too smoothaced for a man however i seldom went abroad but in the night it did well enough but it was a long time before i could behave in my new clothes i mean as to my craft it was impossible to be so nimble so ready so dexterous at these things in a dress so contrary to nature and i did everything clumsily so i had neither the success nor the easiness of escape that i had before and i resolved to leave it off but that resolution was confirmed soon after by the following accident as my governess disguised me like a man so she joined me with a man a young fellow that was nimble enough at his business and for about three weeks we did very well together our principal trade was watching shopkeepers counters and slipping off any kind of goods we could see carelessly laid anywhere and we made several good bargains as we called them at this work and as we kept always together so we grew very intimate yet he never knew that i was not a man nay though i several times went home with him to his lodgings according as our business directed and four or five times lay with him all night but our design lay another way and it was absolutely necessary to me to conceal my sex from him as appeared afterwards the circumstances of our living coming in late and having such and such business to do as required that nobody should be trusted with the coming into our lodgings were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying with him unless i would have owned my sex and as it was i effectually concealed myself but his ill and my good fortune soon put an end to this life which i must own i was sick of too on several other accounts we had made several prizes in this new way of business but the last would be extraordinary there was a shop in a certain street which had a warehouse behind it that looked into another street the house making the corner of the turning through the window of the warehouse we saw lying on the counter or showboard which was just before it five pieces of silks besides other stuffs and though it was almost dark yet the people being busy in the forehop with customers had not had time to shut up those windows or else had forgot it this the young fellow was so overjoyed with that he could not restrain himself it lay all within his reach he said and he swore violently to me that he would have it if he broke down the house for it i dissuaded him a little but saw there was no remedy so he ran rashly upon it slipped out a square of the sash window dexterously enough and without noise and got out four pieces of the silks and came with them towards me but was immediately pursued with a terrible clutter and noise we were standing together indeed but i had not taken any of the goods out of his hand when i said to him hastily you are undone fly for god s sake he ran like lightning and i too but the pursuit was hotter after him because he had the goods than after me he dropped two of the pieces which stopped them a little but the crowd increased and pursued us both they took him soon after with the other two pieces upon him and then the rest followed me i ran for it and got into my governess s house whither some quickyed people followed me so warmly as to fix me there they did not immediately knock at the door by which i got time to throw off my disguise and dress me in my own clothes besides when they came there my governess who had her tale ready kept her door shut and called out to them and told them there was no man come in there the people affirmed there did a man come in there and swore they would break open the door my governess not at all surprised spoke calmly to them told them they should very freely come and search her house if they should bring a constable and let in none but such as the constable would admit for it was unreasonable to let in a whole crowd this they could not refuse though they were a crowd so a constable was fetched immediately and she very freely opened the door the constable kept the door and the men he appointed searched the house my governess going with them from room to room when she came to my room she called to me and said aloud cousin pray open the door here s some gentlemen that must come and look into your room i had a little girl with me which was my governess s grandchild as she called her and i bade her open the door and there sat i at work with a great litter of things about me as if i had been at work all day being myself quite undressed with only nightlothes on my head and a loose morningown wrapped about me my governess made a kind of excuse for their disturbing me telling me partly the occasion of it and that she had no remedy but to open the doors to them and let them satisfy themselves for all she could say to them would not satisfy them i sat still and bid them search the room if they pleased for if there was anybody in the house i was sure they were not in my room and as for the rest of the house i had nothing to say to that i did not understand what they looked for everything looked so innocent and so honest about me that they treated me civiller than i expected but it was not till they had searched the room to a nicety even under the bed in the bed and everywhere else where it was possible anything could be hid when they had done this and could find nothing they asked my pardon for troubling me and went down when they had thus searched the house from bottom to top and then top to bottom and could find nothing they appeased the mob pretty well but they carried my governess before the justice two men swore that they saw the man whom they pursued go into her house my governess rattled and made a great noise that her house should be insulted and that she should be used thus for nothing that if a man did come in he might go out again presently for aught she knew for she was ready to make oath that no man had been within her doors all that day as she knew of and that was very true indee that it might be indeed that as she was abovestairs any fellow in a fright might find the door open and run in for shelter when he was pursued but that she knew nothing of it and if it had been so he certainly went out again perhaps at the other door for she had another door into an alley and so had made his escape and cheated them all this was indeed probable enough and the justice satisfied himself with giving her an oath that she had not received or admitted any man into her house to conceal him or protect or hide him from justice this oath she might justly take and did so and so she was dismissed it is easy to judge what a fright i was in upon this occasion and it was impossible for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that disguise again for as i told her i should certainly betray myself my poor partner in this mischief was now in a bad case for he was carried away before my lord mayor and by his worship committed to newgate and the people that took him were so willing as well as able to prosecute him that they offered themselves to enter into recognisances to appear at the sessions and pursue the charge against him however he got his indictment deferred upon promise to discover his accomplices and particularly the man that was concerned with him in his robbery and he failed not to do his endeavour for he gave in my name whom he called gabriel spencer which was the name i went by to him and here appeared the wisdom of my concealing my name and sex from him which if he had ever known i had been undone he did all he could to discover this gabriel spencer he described me he discovered the place where he said i lodged and in a word all the particulars that he could of my dwelling but having concealed the main circumstances of my sex from him i had a vast advantage and he never could hear of me he brought two or three families into trouble by his endeavouring to find me out but they knew nothing of me any more than that i had a fellow with me that they had seen but knew nothing of and as for my governess though she was the means of his coming to me yet it was done at secondand and he knew nothing of her this turned to his disadvantage for having promised discoveries but not being able to make it good it was looked upon as trifling with the justice of the city and he was the more fiercely pursued by the shopkeepers who took him i was however terribly uneasy all this while and that i might be quite out of the way i went away from my governess s for a while but not knowing wither to wander i took a maidervant with me and took the stageoach to dunstable to my old landlord and landlady where i had lived so handsomely with my lancashire husband here i told her a formal story that i expected my husband every day from ireland and that i had sent a letter to him that i would meet him at dunstable at her house and that he would certainly land if the wind was fair in a few days so that i was come to spend a few days with them till he should come for he was either come post or in the west chester coach i knew not which but whichsoever it was he would be sure to come to that house to meet me my landlady was mighty glad to see me and my landlord made such a stir with me that if i had been a princess i could not have been better used and here i might have been welcome a month or two if i had thought fit but my business was of another nature i was very uneasy though so well disguised that it was scarce possible to detect lest this fellow should somehow or other find me out and though he could not charge me with this robbery having persuaded him not to venture and having also done nothing in it myself but run away yet he might have charged me with other things and have bought his own life at the expense of mine this filled me with horrible apprehensions i had no recourse no friend no confidante but my old governess and i knew no remedy but to put my life in her hands and so i did for i let her know where to send to me and had several letters from her while i stayed here some of them almost scared me out my wits but at last she sent me the joyful news that he was hanged which was the best news to me that i had heard a great while i had stayed here five weeks and lived very comfortably indeed the secret anxiety of my mind excepte but when i received this letter i looked pleasantly again and told my landlady that i had received a letter from my spouse in ireland that i had the good news of his being very well but had the bad news that his business would not permit him to come away so soon as he expected and so i was like to go back again without him my landlady complimented me upon the good news however that i had heard he was well for i have observed madam says she you hadn t been so pleasant as you used to be you have been over head and ears in care for him i dare say says the good woman tis easy to be seen there s an alteration in you for the better says she well i am sorry the esquire can t come yet says my landlord i should have been heartily glad to have seen him but i hope when you have certain news of his coming you take a step hither again madam says he you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come with all these fine compliments we parted and i came merry enough to london and found my governess as well pleased as i was and now she told me she would never recommend any partner to me again for she always found she said that i had the best luck when i ventured by myself and so indeed i had for i was seldom in any danger when i was by myself or if i was i got out of it with more dexterity than when i was entangled with the dull measures of other people who had perhaps less forecast and were more rash and impatient than i for though i had as much courage to venture as any of them yet i used more caution before i undertook a thing and had more presence of mind when i was to bring myself off i have often wondered even at my own hardiness another way that when all my companions were surprised and fell so suddenly into the hand of justice and that i so narrowly escaped yet i could not all this while enter into one serious resolution to leave off this trade and especially considering that i was now very far from being poor that the temptation of necessity which is generally the introduction of all such wickedness was now removed for i had near by me in ready money on which i might have lived very well if i had thought fit to have retired but i say i had not so much as the least inclination to leave off no not so much as i had before when i had but beforehand and when i had no such frightful examples before my eyes as these were from hence tis evident to me that when once we are hardened in crime no fear can affect us no example give us any warning i had indeed one comrade whose fate went very near me for a good while though i wore it off too in time that case was indeed very unhappy i had made a prize of a piece of very good damask in a mercer s shop and went clear off myself but had conveyed the piece to this companion of mine when we went out of the shop and she went one way and i went another we had not been long out of the shop but the mercer missed his piece of stuff and sent his messengers one one way and one another and they presently seized her that had the piece with the damask upon her as for me i had very luckily stepped into a house where there was a lace chamber up one pair of stairs and had the satisfaction or the terror indeed of looking out of the window upon the noise they made and seeing the poor creature dragged away in triumph to the justice who immediately committed her to newgate i was careful to attempt nothing in the lace chamber but tumbled their goods pretty much to spend time then bought a few yards of edging and paid for it and came away very sadearted indeed for the poor woman who was in tribulation for what i only had stolen here again my old caution stood me in good stead namely that though i often robbed with these people yet i never let them know who i was or where i lodged nor could they ever find out my lodging though they often endeavoured to watch me to it they all knew me by the name of moll flanders though even some of them rather believed i was she than knew me to be so my name was public among them indeed but how to find me out they knew not nor so much as how to guess at my quarters whether they were at the east end of the town or the west and this wariness was my safety upon all these occasions i kept close a great while upon the occasion of this woman s disaster i knew that if i should do anything that should miscarry and should be carried to prison she would be there and ready to witness against me and perhaps save her life at my expense i considered that i began to be very well known by name at the old bailey though they did not know my face and that if i should fall into their hands i should be treated as an old offender and for this reason i was resolved to see what this poor creature s fate should be before i stirred abroad though several times in her distress i conveyed money to her for her relief at length she came to her trial she pleaded she did not steal the thing but that one mrs flanders as she heard her called for she did not know he gave the bundle to her after they came out of the shop and bade her carry it home to her lodging they asked her where this mrs flanders was but she could not produce her neither could she give the least account of me and the mercer s men swearing positively that she was in the shop when the goods were stolen that they immediately missed them and pursued her and found them upon her thereupon the jury brought her in guilty but the court considering that she was really not the person that stole the goods an inferior assistant and that it was very possible she could not find out this mrs flanders meaning me though it would save her life which indeed was true i say considering all this they allowed her to be transported which was the utmost favour she could obtain only that the court told her that if she could in the meantime produce the said mrs flanders they would intercede for her pardon that is to say if she could find me out and hand me she should not be transported this i took care to make impossible to her and so she was shipped off in pursuance of her sentence a little while after i must repeat it again that the fate of this poor woman troubled me exceedingly and i began to be very pensive knowing that i was really the instrument of her disaster but the preservation of my own life which was so evidently in danger took off all my tenderness and seeing that she was not put to death i was very easy at her transportation because she was then out of the way of doing me any mischief whatever should happen the disaster of this woman was some months before that of the lastecited story and was indeed partly occasion of my governess proposing to dress me up in men s clothes that i might go about unobserved as indeed i did but i was soon tired of that disguise as i have said for indeed it exposed me to too many difficulties i was now easy as to all fear of witnesses against me for all those that had either been concerned with me or that knew me by the name of moll flanders were either hanged or transported and if i should have had the misfortune to be taken i might call myself anything else as well as moll flanders and no old sins could be placed into my account so i began to run aick again with the more freedom and several successful adventures i made though not such as i had made before we had at that time another fire happened not a great way off from the place where my governess lived and i made an attempt there as before but as i was not soon enough before the crowd of people came in and could not get to the house i aimed at instead of a prize i got a mischief which had almost put a period to my life and all my wicked doings together for the fire being very furious and the people in a great fright in removing their goods and throwing them out of window a wench from out of a window threw a feathered just upon me it is true the bed being soft it broke no bones but as the weight was great and made greater by the fall it beat me down and laid me dead for a while nor did the people concern themselves much to deliver me from it or to recover me at all but i lay like one dead and neglected a good while till somebody going to remove the bed out of the way helped me up it was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not thrown other goods out after it and which might have fallen upon it and then i had been inevitably killed but i was reserved for further afflictions this accident however spoiled my market for that time and i came home to my governess very much hurt and bruised and frighted to the last degree and it was a good while before she could set me upon my feet again it was now a merry time of the year and bartholomew fair was begun i had never made any walks that way nor was the common part of the fair of much advantage to me but i took a turn this year into the cloisters and among the rest i fell into one of the raffling shops it was a thing of no great consequence to me nor did i expect to make much of it but there came a gentleman extremely well dressed and very rich and as tis frequent to talk to everybody in those shops he singled me out and was very particular with me first he told me he would put in for me to raffle and did so and some small matter coming to his lot he presented it to me i think it was a feather muf then he continued to keep talking to me with a more than common appearance of respect but still very civil and much like a gentleman he held me in talk so long till at last he drew me out of the raffling place to the shopoor and then to a walk in the cloister still talking of a thousand things cursorily without anything to the purpose at last he told me that without compliment he was charmed with my company and asked me if i durst trust myself in a coach with him he told me he was a man of honour and would not offer anything to me unbecoming him as such i seemed to decline it a while but suffered myself to be importuned a little and then yielded i was at a loss in my thoughts to conclude at first what this gentleman designed but i found afterwards he had had some drink in his head and that he was not very unwilling to have some more he carried me in the coach to the spring garden at knightsbridge where we walked in the gardens and he treated me very handsomely but i found he drank very freely he pressed me also to drink but i declined it hitherto he kept his word with me and offered me nothing amiss we came away in the coach again and he brought me into the streets and by this time it was near ten o clock at night and he stopped the coach at a house where it seems he was acquainted and where they made no scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it at first i seemed to be unwilling to go up but after a few words i yielded to that too being willing to see the end of it and in hope to make something of it at last as for the bed etc i was not much concerned about that part here he began to be a little freer with me than he had promised and i by little and little yielded to everything so that in a word he did what he pleased with me i need say no more all this while he drank freely too and about one in the morning we went into the coach again the air and the shaking of the coach made the drink he had get more up in his head than it was before and he grew uneasy in the coach and was for acting over again what he had been doing before but as i thought my game now secure i resisted him and brought him to be a little still which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast asleep i took this opportunity to search him to a nicety i took a gold watch with a silk purse of gold his fine fullottom periwig and silverringed gloves his sword and fine snuffox and gently opening the coach door stood ready to jump out while the coach was going on but the coach stopped in the narrow street beyond temple bar to let another coach pass i got softly out fastened the door again and gave my gentleman and the coach the slip both together and never heard more of them this was an adventure indeed unlooked for and perfectly undesigned by me though i was not so past the merry part of life as to forget how to behave when a fop so blinded by his appetite should not know an old woman from a young i did not indeed look so old as i was by ten or twelve years yet i was not a young wench of seventeen and it was easy enough to be distinguished there is nothing so absurd so surfeiting so ridiculous as a man heated by wine in his head and wicked gust in his inclination together he is in the possession of two devils at once and can no more govern himself by his reason than a mill can grind without water his vice tramples upon all that was in him that had any good in it if any such thing there was nay his very sense is blinded by its own rage and he acts absurdities even in his views such a drinking more when he is drunk already picking up a common woman without regard to what she is or who she is whether sound or rotten clean or unclean whether ugly or handsome whether old or young and so blinded as not really to distinguish such a man is worse than a lunatic prompted by his vicious corrupted head he no more knows what he is doing than this wretch of mine knew when i picked his pocket of his watch and his purse of gold these are the men of whom solomon says they go like an ox to the slaughter till a dart strikes through their liver an admirable description by the way of the foul disease which is a poisonous deadly contagion mingling with the blood whose centre or foundation is in the liver from whence by the swift circulation of the whole mass that dreadful nauseous plague strikes immediately through his liver and his spirits are infected his vitals stabbed through as with a dart it is true this poor unguarded wretch was in no danger from me though i was greatly apprehensive at first of what danger i might be in from him but he was really to be pitied in one respect that he seemed to be a good sort of man in himself a gentleman that had no harm in his design a man of sense and of a fine behaviour a comely handsome person a sober solid countenance a charming beautiful face and everything that could be agreeable only had unhappily had some drink the night before had not been in bed as he told me when we were together was hot and his blood fired with wine and in that condition his reason as it were asleep had given him up as for me my business was his money and what i could make of him and after that if i could have found out any way to have done it i would have sent him safe home to his house and to his family for twas ten to one but he had an honest virtuous wife and innocent children that were anxious for his safety and would have been glad to have gotten him home and have taken care of him till he was restored to himself and then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a whore picked up in the worst of all holes the cloister among the dirt and filth of all the town how would he be trembling for fear he had got the pox for fear a dart had struck through his liver and hate himself every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his debauch how would he if he had any principles of honour as i verily believe he had i say how would he abhor the thought of giving any ill distemper if he had it as for aught he knew he might to his modest and virtuous wife and thereby sowing the contagion in the lifelood of his posterity would such gentlemen but consider the contemptible thoughts which the very women they are concerned with in such cases as these have of them it would be a surfeit to them as i said above they value not the pleasure they are raised by no inclination to the man the passive jade thinks of no pleasure but the money and when he is as it were drunk in the ecstasies of his wicked pleasure her hands are in his pockets searching for what she can find there and of which he can no more be sensible in the moment of his folly that he can forethink of it when he goes about it i knew a woman that was so dexterous with a fellow who indeed deserved no better usage that while he was busy with her another way conveyed his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fobocket where he had put it for fear of her and put another purse with gilded counters in it into the room of it after he had done he says to her now han t you picked my pocket she jested with him and told him she supposed he had not much to lose he put his hand to his fob and with his fingers felt that his purse was there which fully satisfied him and so she brought off his money and this was a trade with her she kept a sham gold watch that is a watch of silver gilt and a purse of counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions and i doubt not practiced it with success i came home with this last booty to my governess and really when i told her the story it so affected her that she was hardly able to forbear tears to know how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being undone every time a glass of wine got into his head but as to the purchase i got and how entirely i stripped him she told me it pleased her wonderfully nay child says she the usage may for aught i know do more to reform him than all the sermons that ever he will hear in his life and if the remainder of the story be true so it did i found the next day she was wonderful inquisitive about this gentleman the description i had given her of him his dress his person his face everything concurred to make her think of a gentleman whose character she knew and family too she mused a while and i going still on with the particulars she starts up says she i lay i know the gentleman i am sorry you do says i for i would not have him exposed on any account in the world he has had injury enough already by me and i would not be instrumental to do him any more no no says she i will do him no injury i assure you but you may let me satisfy my curiosity a little for if it is he i warrant you i find it out i was a little startled at that and told her with an apparent concern in my face that by the same rule he might find me out and then i was undone she returned warmly why do you think i will betray you child no no says she not for all he is worth in the world i have kept your counsel in worse things than these sure you may trust me in this so i said no more at that time she laid her scheme another way and without acquainting me of it but she was resolved to find it out if possible so she goes to a certain friend of hers who was acquainted in the family that she guessed at and told her friend she had some extraordinary business with such a gentleman who by the way was no less than a baronet and of a very good famil and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody to introduce her her friend promised her very readily to do it and accordingly goes to the house to see if the gentleman was in town the next day she come to my governess and tells her that sir was at home but that he had met with a disaster and was very ill and there was no speaking with him what disaster says my governess hastily as if she was surprised at it why says her friend he had been at hampstead to visit a gentleman of his acquaintance and as he came back again he was set upon and robbed and having got a little drink too as they suppose the rogues abused him and he is very ill robbed says my governess and what did they take from him why says her friend they took his gold watch and his gold snuffox his fine periwig and what money he had in his pocket which was considerable to be sure for sir never goes without a purse of guineas about him pshaw says my old governess jeering i warrant you he has got drunk now and got a whore and she has picked his pocket and so he comes home to his wife and tells her he has been robbed that s an old sham a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor women every day fie says her friend i find you don t know sir why he is as civil a gentleman there is not a finer man nor a soberer graver modester person in the whole city he abhors such things there s nobody that knows him will think such a thing of him well well says my governess that s none of my business if it was i warrant i should find there was something of that kind in it your modest men in common opinion are sometimes no better than other people only they keep a better character or if you please are the better hypocrites no no says her friend i can assure you sir is no hypocrite he is really an honest sober gentleman and he has certainly been robbed nay says my governess it may be he has it is no business of mine i tell you i only want to speak with him my business is of another nature but says her friend let your business be of what nature it will you cannot see him yet for he is not fit to be seen for he is very ill and bruised very much ay says my governess nay then he has fallen into bad hands to be sure and then she asked gravely pray where is he bruised why in the head says her friend and one of his hands and his face for they used him barbarously poor gentleman says my governess i must wait then till he recovers and adds i hope it will not be long for i want very much to speak with him away she comes to me and tells me this story i have found out your fine gentleman and a fine gentleman he was says she but mercy on him he is in a sad pickle now i wonder what the you have done to him why you have almost killed him i looked at her with disorder enough i killed him says i you must mistake the person i am sure i did nothing to him he was very well when i left him said i only drunk and fast asleep i know nothing of that says she but he is in a sad pickle now and so she told me all that her friend had said to her well then says i he fell into bad hands after i left him for i am sure i left him safe enough about ten days after or a little more my governess goes again to her friend to introduce her to this gentleman she had inquired other ways in the meantime and found that he was about again if not abroad again so she got leave to speak with him she was a woman of a admirable address and wanted nobody to introduce her she told her tale much better than i shall be able to tell it for her for she was a mistress of her tongue as i have said already she told him that she came though a stranger with a single design of doing him a service and he should find she had no other end in it that as she came purely on so friendly an account she begged promise from him that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose he would not take it ill that she meddled with what was not her business she assured him that as what she had to say was a secret that belonged to him only so whether he accepted her offer or not it should remain a secret to all the world unless he exposed it himself nor should his refusing her service in it make her so little show her respect as to do him the least injury so that he should be entirely at liberty to act as he thought fit he looked very shy at first and said he knew nothing that related to him that required much secrecy that he had never done any man any wrong and cared not what anybody might say of him that it was no part of his character to be unjust to anybody nor could he imagine in what any man could render him any service but that if it was so disinterested a service as she said he could not take it ill from any one that they should endeavour to serve him and so as it were left her a liberty either to tell him or not to tell as she thought fit she found him so perfectly indifferent that she was almost afraid to enter into the point with him but however after some other circumlocutions she told him that by a strange and unaccountable accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy adventure he had fallen into and that in such a manner that there was nobody in the world but herself and him that were acquainted with it no not the very person that was with him he looked a little angrily at first what adventure said he why said she of your being robbed coming from knightbr hampstead sir i should say says she be not surprised sir says she that i am able to tell you every step you took that day from the cloister in smithfield to the spring garden at knightsbridge and thence to the in the strand and how you were left asleep in the coach afterwards i say let not this surprise you for sir i do not come to make a booty of you i ask nothing of you and i assure you the woman that was with you knows nothing who you are and never shall and yet perhaps i may serve you further still for i did not come barely to let you know that i was informed of these things as if i wanted a bribe to conceal them assure yourself sir said she that whatever you think fit to do or say to me it shall be all a secret as it is as much as if i were in my grave he was astonished at her discourse and said gravely to her madam you are a stranger to me but it is very unfortunate that you should be let into the secret of the worst action of my life and a thing that i am so justly ashamed of that the only satisfaction of it to me was that i thought it was known only to god and my own conscience pray sir says she do not reckon the discovery of it to me to be any part of your misfortune it was a thing i believe you were surprised into and perhaps the woman used some art to prompt you to it however you will never find any just cause said she to repent that i came to hear of it nor can your own mouth be more silent in it that i have been and ever shall be well says he but let me do some justice to the woman too whoever she is i do assure you she prompted me to nothing she rather declined me it was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all ay and brought her into it too i must give her her due so far as to what she took from me i could expect no less from her in the condition i was in and to this hour i know not whether she robbed me or the coachman if she did it i forgive her and i think all gentlemen that do so should be used in the same manner but i am more concerned for some other things that i am for all that she took from me my governess now began to come into the whole matter and he opened himself freely to her first she said to him in answer to what he had said about me i am glad sir you are so just to the person that you were with i assure you she is a gentlewoman and no woman of the town and however you prevailed with her so far as you did i am sure tis not her practice you ran a great venture indeed sir but if that be any part of your care i am persuaded you may be perfectly easy for i dare assure you no man has touched her before you since her husband and he has been dead now almost eight years it appeared that this was his grievance and that he was in a very great fright about it however when my governess said this to him he appeared very well pleased and said well madam to be plain with you if i was satisfied of that i should not so much value what i lost for as to that the temptation was great and perhaps she was poor and wanted it if she had not been poor sir says my governess i assure you she would never have yielded to you and as her poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did so the same poverty prevailed with her to pay herself at last when she saw you were in such a condition that if she had not done it perhaps the next coachman might have done it well says he much good may it do her i say again all the gentlemen that do so ought to be used in the same manner and then they would be cautious of themselves i have no more concern about it but on the score which you hinted at before madam here he entered into some freedoms with her on the subject of what passed between us which are not so proper for a woman to write and the great terror that was upon his mind with relation to his wife for fear he should have received any injury from me and should communicate if farther and asked her at last if she could not procure him an opportunity to speak with me my governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman clear from any such thing and that he was as entirely safe in that respect as he was with his own lady but as for seeing me she said it might be of dangerous consequence but however that she would talk with me and let him know my answer using at the same time some arguments to persuade him not to desire it and that it could be of no service to him seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew a correspondence with me and that on my account it was a kind of putting my life in his hands he told her he had a great desire to see me that he would give her any assurances that were in his power not to take any advantages of me and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all demands of any kind she insisted how it might tend to a further divulging the secret and might in the end be injurious to him entreating him not to press for it so at length he desisted they had some discourse upon the subject of the things he had lost and he seemed to be very desirous of his gold watch and told her if she could procure that for him he would willingly give as much for it as it was worth she told him she would endeavour to procure it for him and leave the valuing it to himself accordingly the next day she carried the watch and he gave her thirty guineas for it which was more than i should have been able to make of it though it seems it cost much more he spoke something of his periwig which it seems cost him threescore guineas and his snuffox and in a few days more she carried them too which obliged him very much and he gave her thirty more the next day i sent him his fine sword and cane gratis and demanded nothing of him but i had no mind to see him unless it had been so that he might be satisfied i knew who he was which he was not willing to then he entered into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to know all this matter she formed a long tale of that part how she had it from one that i had told the whole story to and that was to help me dispose of the goods and this confidante brought the things to her she being by profession a pawnbroker and she hearing of his worship s disaster guessed at the thing in general that having gotten the things into her hands she had resolved to come and try as she had done she then gave him repeated assurances that it should never go out of her mouth and though she knew the woman very well yet she had not let her know meaning me anything of it that is to say who the person was which by the way was false but however it was not to his damage for i never opened my mouth of it to anybody i had a great many thoughts in my head about my seeing him again and was often sorry that i had refused it i was persuaded that if i had seen him and let him know that i knew him i should have made some advantage of him and perhaps have had some maintenance from him and though it was a life wicked enough yet it was not so full of danger as this i was engaged in however those thoughts wore off and i declined seeing him again for that time but my governess saw him often and he was very kind to her giving her something almost every time he saw her one time in particular she found him very merry and as she thought he had some wine in his head and he pressed her again very earnestly to let him see that woman that as he said had bewitched him so that night my governess who was from the beginning for my seeing him told him he was so desirous of it that she could almost yield of it if she could prevail upon me adding that if he would please to come to her house in the evening she would endeavour it upon his repeated assurances of forgetting what was past accordingly she came to me and told me all the discourse in short she soon biassed me to consent in a case which i had some regret in my mind for declining before so i prepared to see him i dressed me to all the advantage possible i assure you and for the first time used a little art i say for the first time for i had never yielded to the baseness of paint before having always had vanity enough to believe i had no need of it at the hour appointed he came and as she observed before so it was plain still that he had been drinking though very far from what we call being in drink he appeared exceeding pleased to see me and entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair i begged his pardon very often for my share of it protested i had not any such design when first i met him that i had not gone out with him but that i took him for a very civil gentleman and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me he alleged the wine he drank and that he scarce knew what he did and that if it had not been so i should never have let him take the freedom with me that he had done he protested to me that he never touched any woman but me since he was married to his wife and it was a surprise upon him complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable to him and the like and talked so much of that kind till i found he had talked himself almost into a temper to do the same thing over again but i took him up short i protested i had never suffered any man to touch me since my husband died which was near eight years he said he believed it to be so truly and added that madam had intimated as much to him and that it was his opinion of that part which made his desire to see me again and that since he had once broke in upon his virtue with me and found no ill consequences he could be safe in venturing there again and so in short it went on to what i expected and to what will not bear relating my old governess had foreseen it as well as i and therefore led him into a room which had not a bed in it and yet had a chamber within it which had a bed whither we withdrew for the rest of the night and in short after some time being together he went to bed and lay there all night i withdrew but came again undressed in the morning before it was day and lay with him the rest of the time thus you see having committed a crime once is a sad handle to the committing of it again whereas all the regret and reflections wear off when the temptation renews itself had i not yielded to see him again the corrupt desire in him had worn off and tis very probable he had never fallen into it with anybody else as i really believe he had not done before when he went away i told him i hoped he was satisfied he had not been robbed again he told me he was satisfied in that point and could trust me again and putting his hand in his pocket gave me five guineas which was the first money i had gained that way for many years i had several visits of the like kind from him but he never came into a settled way of maintenance which was what i would have best pleased with once indeed he asked me how i did to live i answered him pretty quick that i assured him i had never taken that course that i took with him but that indeed i worked at my needle and could just maintain myself that sometime it was as much as i was able to do and i shifted hard enough he seemed to reflect upon himself that he should be the first person to lead me into that which he assured me he never intended to do himself and it touched him a little he said that he should be the cause of his own sin and mine too he would often make just reflections also upon the crime itself and upon the particular circumstances of it with respect to himself how wine introduced the inclinations how the devil led him to the place and found out an object to tempt him and he made the moral always himself when these thoughts were upon him he would go away and perhaps not come again in a month s time or longer but then as the serious part wore off the lewd part would wear in and then he came prepared for the wicked part thus we lived for some time thought he did not keep as they call it yet he never failed doing things that were handsome and sufficient to maintain me without working and which was better without following my old trade but this affair had its end too for after about a year i found that he did not come so often as usual and at last he left if off altogether without any dislike to bidding adieu and so there was an end of that short scene of life which added no great store to me only to make more work for repentance however during this interval i confined myself pretty much at home at least being thus provided for i made no adventures no not for a quarter of a year after he left me but then finding the fund fail and being loth to spend upon the main stock i began to think of my old trade and to look abroad into the street again and my first step was lucky enough i had dressed myself up in a very mean habit for as i had several shapes to appear in i was now in an ordinary stuffown a blue apron and a straw hat and i placed myself at the door of the three cups inn in st john street there were several carriers used the inn and the stageoaches for barnet for totteridge and other towns that way stood always in the street in the evening when they prepared to set out so that i was ready for anything that offered for either one or other the meaning was this people come frequently with bundles and small parcels to those inns and call for such carriers or coaches as they want to carry them into the country and there generally attend women porters wives or daughters ready to take in such things for their respective people that employ them it happened very oddly that i was standing at the inn gate and a woman that had stood there before and which was the porter s wife belonging to the barnet stageoach having observed me asked if i waited for any of the coaches i told her yes i waited for my mistress that was coming to go to barnet she asked me who was my mistress and i told her any madam s name that came next me but as it seemed i happened upon a name a family of which name lived at hadley just beyond barnet i said no more to her or she to me a good while but by and by somebody calling her at a door a little way off she desired me that if anybody called for the barnet coach i would step and call her at the house which it seems was an alehouse i said yes very readily and away she went she was no sooner gone but comes a wench and a child puffing and sweating and asks for the barnet coach i answered presently here do you belong to the barnet coach says she yes sweetheart said i what do ye want i want room for two passengers says she where are they sweetheart said i here s this girl pray let her go into the coach says she and i go and fetch my mistress make haste then sweetheart says i for we may be full else the maid had a great bundle under her arm so she put the child into the coach and i said you had best put your bundle into the coach too no says she i am afraid somebody should slip it away from the child give to me then said i and i take care of it do then says she and be sure you take of it i answer for it said i if it were for value there take it then says she and away she goes as soon as i had got the bundle and the maid was out of sight i goes on towards the alehouse where the porter s wife was so that if i had met her i had then only been going to give her the bundle and to call her to her business as if i was going away and could stay no longer but as i did not meet her i walked away and turning into charterhouse lane then crossed into bartholomew close so into little britain and through the bluecoat hospital into newgate street to prevent my being known i pulled off my blue apron and wrapped the bundle in it which before was made up in a piece of painted calico and very remarkable i also wrapped up my straw hat in it and so put the bundle upon my head and it was very well that i did thus for coming through the bluecoat hospital who should i meet but the wench that had given me the bundle to hold it seems she was going with her mistress whom she had been gone to fetch to the barnet coaches i saw she was in haste and i had no business to stop her so away she went and i brought my bundle safe home to my governess there was no money nor plate or jewels in the bundle but a very good suit of indian damask a gown and a petticoat a lacedead and ruffles of very good flanders lace and some linen and other things such as i knew very well the value of this was not indeed my own invention but was given me by one that had practised it with success and my governess liked it extremely and indeed i tried it again several times though never twice near the same place for the next time i tried it in white chapel just by the corner of petticoat lane where the coaches stand that go out to stratford and bow and that side of the country and another time at the flying horse without bishopgate where the cheston coaches then lay and i had always the good luck to come off with some booty another time i placed myself at a warehouse by the waterside where the coasting vessels from the north come such as from newcastleponyne sunderland and other places here the warehouses being shut comes a young fellow with a letter and he wanted a box and a hamper that was come from newcastleponyne i asked him if he had the marks of it so he shows me the letter by virtue of which he was to ask for it and which gave an account of the contents the box being full of linen and the hamper full of glass ware i read the letter and took care to see the name and the marks the name of the person that sent the goods the name of the person that they were sent to then i bade the messenger come in the morning for that the warehouseeeper would not be there any more that night away went i and getting materials in a public house i wrote a letter from mr john richardson of newcastle to his dear cousin jemmy cole in london with an account that he sent by such a vessel for i remembered all the particulars to a titl so many pieces of huckaback linen so many ells of dutch holland and the like in a box and a hamper of flint glasses from mr henzill s glasshouse and that the box was marked i no and the hamper was directed by a label on the cording about an hour after i came to the warehouse found the warehouseeeper and had the goods delivered me without any scruple the value of the linen being about i could fill up this whole discourse with the variety of such adventures which daily invention directed to and which i managed with the utmost dexterity and always with success at length as when does the pitcher come safe home that goes so very often to the well i fell into some small broils which though they could not affect me fatally yet made me known which was the worst thing next to being found guilty that could befall me i had taken up the disguise of a widow s dress it was without any real design in view but only waiting for anything that might offer as i often did it happened that while i was going along the street in covent garden there was a great cry of stop thief stop thief some artists had it seems put a trick upon a shopkeeper and being pursued some of them fled one way and some another and one of them was they said dressed up in widow s weeds upon which the mob gathered about me and some said i was the person others said no immediately came the mercer s journeyman and he swore aloud i was the person and so seized on me however when i was brought back by the mob to the mercer s shop the master of the house said freely that i was not the woman that was in his shop and would have let me go immediately but another fellow said gravely pray stay till mr meaning the journeyma comes back for he knows her so they kept me by force near half an hour they had called a constable and he stood in the shop as my jailer and in talking with the constable i inquired where he lived and what trade he was the man not apprehending in the least what happened afterwards readily told me his name and trade and where he lived and told me as a jest that i might be sure to hear of his name when i came to the old bailey some of the servants likewise used me saucily and had much ado to keep their hands off me the master indeed was civiller to me than they but he would not yet let me go though he owned he could not say i was in his shop before i began to be a little surly with him and told him i hoped he would not take it ill if i made myself amends upon him in a more legal way another time and desired i might send for friends to see me have right done me no he said he could give no such liberty i might ask it when i came before the justice of peace and seeing i threatened him he would take care of me in the meantime and would lodge me safe in newgate i told him it was his time now but it would be mine by and by and governed my passion as well as i was able however i spoke to the constable to call me a porter which he did and then i called for pen ink and paper but they would let me have none i asked the porter his name and where he lived and the poor man told it me very willingly i bade him observe and remember how i was treated there that he saw i was detained there by force i told him i should want his evidence in another place and it should not be the worse for him to speak the porter said he would serve me with all his heart but madam says he let me hear them refuse to let you go then i may be able to speak the plainer with that i spoke aloud to the master of the shop and said sir you know in your own conscience that i am not the person you look for and that i was not in your shop before therefore i demand that you detain me here no longer or tell me the reason of your stopping me the fellow grew surlier upon this than before and said he would do neither till he thought fit very well said i to the constable and to the porter you will be pleased to remember this gentlemen another time the porter said yes madam and the constable began not to like it and would have persuaded the mercer to dismiss him and let me go since as he said he owned i was not the person good sir says the mercer to him tauntingly are you a justice of peace or a constable i charged you with her pray do you do your duty the constable told him a little moved but very handsomely i know my duty and what i am sir i doubt you hardly know what you are doing they had some other hard words and in the meantime the journeyman impudent and unmanly to the last degree used me barbarously and one of them the same that first seized upon me pretended he would search me and began to lay hands on me i spit in his face called out to the constable and bade him to take notice of my usage and pray mr constable said i ask that villain s name pointing to the man the constable reproved him decently told him that he did not know what he did for he knew that his master acknowledged i was not the person that was in his shop and says the constable i am afraid your master is bringing himself and me too into trouble if this gentlewoman comes to prove who she is and where she was and it appears that she is not the woman you pretend to damn her says the fellow again with a impudent hardened face she is the lady you may depend upon it i swear she is the same body that was in the shop and that i gave the pieces of satin that is lost into her own hand you shall hear more of it when mr william and mr anthony those were other journeyme come back they will know her again as well as i just as the insolent rogue was talking thus to the constable comes back mr william and mr anthony as he called them and a great rabble with them bringing along with them the true widow that i was pretended to be and they came sweating and blowing into the shop and with a great deal of triumph dragging the poor creature in the most butcherly manner up towards their master who was in the back shop and cried out aloud here s the widow sir we have catched her at last what do ye mean by that says the master why we have her already there she sits says he and mr says he can swear this is she the other man whom they called mr anthony replied mr may say what he will and swear what he will but this is the woman and there s the remnant of satin she stole i took it out of her clothes with my own hand i sat still now and began to take a better heart but smiled and said nothing the master looked pale the constable turned about and looked at me let em alone mr constable said i let em go on the case was plain and could not be denied so the constable was charged with the right thief and the mercer told me very civilly he was sorry for the mistake and hoped i would not take it ill that they had so many things of this nature put upon them every day that they could not be blamed for being very sharp in doing themselves justice not take it ill sir said i how can i take it well if you had dismissed me when your insolent fellow seized on me it the street and brought me to you and when you yourself acknowledged i was not the person i would have put it by and not taken it ill because of the many ill things i believe you have put upon you daily but your treatment of me since has been insufferable and especially that of your servant i must and will have reparation for that then he began to parley with me said he would make me any reasonable satisfaction and would fain have had me tell him what it was i expected i told him that i should not be my own judge the law should decide it for me and as i was to be carried before a magistrate i should let him hear there what i had to say he told me there was no occasion to go before the justice now i was at liberty to go where i pleased and so calling to the constable told him he might let me go for i was discharged the constable said calmly to him sir you asked me just now if i knew whether i was a constable or justice and bade me do my duty and charged me with this gentlewoman as a prisoner now sir i find you do not understand what is my duty for you would make me a justice indeed but i must tell you it is not in my power i may keep a prisoner when i am charged with him but tis the law and the magistrate alone that can discharge that prisoner therefore tis a mistake sir i must carry her before a justice now whether you think well of it or not the mercer was very high with the constable at first but the constable happening to be not a hired officer but a good substantial kind of man i think he was a cornandle and a man of good sense stood to his business would not discharge me without going to a justice of the peace and i insisted upon it too when the mercer saw that well says he to the constable you may carry her where you please i have nothing to say to her but sir says the constable you will go with us i hope for tis you that charged me with her no not i says the mercer i tell you i have nothing to say to her but pray sir do says the constable i desire it of you for your own sake for the justice can do nothing without you prithee fellow says the mercer go about your business i tell you i have nothing to say to the gentlewoman i charge you in the king s name to dismiss her sir says the constable i find you don t know what it is to be constable i beg of you don t oblige me to be rude to you i think i need not you are rude enough already says the mercer no sir says the constable i am not rude you have broken the peace in bringing an honest woman out of the street when she was about her lawful occasion confining her in your shop and illsing her here by your servants and now can you say i am rude to you i think i am civil to you in not commanding or charging you in the king s name to go with me and charging every man i see that passes your door to aid and assist me in carrying you by force this you cannot but know i have power to do and yet i forbear it and once more entreat you to go with me well he would not for all this and gave the constable ill language however the constable kept his temper and would not be provoked and then i put in and said come mr constable let him alone i shall find ways enough to fetch him before a magistrate i don t fear that but there s the fellow says i he was the man that seized on me as i was innocently going along the street and you are a witness of the violence with me since give me leave to charge you with him and carry him before the justice yes madam says the constable and turning to the fellow come young gentleman says he to the journeyman you must go along with us i hope you are not above the constable s power though your master is the fellow looked like a condemned thief and hung back then looked at his master as if he could help him and he like a fool encourage the fellow to be rude and he truly resisted the constable and pushed him back with a good force when he went to lay hold on him at which the constable knocked him down and called out for help and immediately the shop was filled with people and the constable seized the master and man and all his servants this first ill consequence of this fray was that the woman they had taken who was really the thief made off and got clear away in the crowd and two other that they had stopped also whether they were really guilty or not that i can say nothing to by this time some of his neighbours having come in and upon inquiry seeing how things went had endeavoured to bring the hotrained mercer to his senses and he began to be convinced that he was in the wrong and so at length we went all very quietly before the justice with a mob of about five hundred people at our heels and all the way i went i could hear the people ask what was the matter and other reply and say a mercer had stopped a gentlewoman instead of a thief and had afterwards taken the thief and now the gentlewoman had taken the mercer and was carrying him before the justice this pleased the people strangely and made the crowd increase and they cried out as they went which is the rogue which is the mercer and especially the women then when they saw him they cried out that s he that s he and every now and then came a good dab of dirt at him and thus we marched a good while till the mercer thought fit to desire the constable to call a coach to protect himself from the rabble so we rode the rest of the way the constable and i and the mercer and his man when we came to the justice which was an ancient gentleman in bloomsbury the constable giving first a summary account of the matter the justice bade me speak and tell what i had to say and first he asked my name which i was very loth to give but there was no remedy so i told him my name was mary flanders that i was a widow my husband being a sea captain died on a voyage to virginia and some other circumstances i told which he could never contradict and that i lodged at present in town with such a person naming my governess but that i was preparing to go over to america where my husband s effects lay and that i was going that day to buy some clothes to put myself into second mourning but had not yet been in any shop when that fellow pointing to the mercer s journeyman came rushing upon me with such fury as very much frighted me and carried me back to his master s shop where though his master acknowledged i was not the person yet he would not dismiss me but charged a constable with me then i proceeded to tell how the journeyman treated me how they would not suffer me to send for any of my friends how afterwards they found the real thief and took the very goods they had lost upon her and all the particulars as before then the constable related his case his dialogue with the mercer about discharging me and at last his servant s refusing to go with him when he had charged him with him and his master encouraging him to do so and at last his striking the constable and the like all as i have told it already the justice then heard the mercer and his man the mercer indeed made a long harangue of the great loss they have daily by lifters and thieves that it was easy for them to mistake and that when he found it he would have dismissed me etc as above as to the journeyman he had very little to say but that he pretended other of the servants told him that i was really the person upon the whole the justice first of all told me very courteously i was discharged that he was very sorry that the mercer s man should in his eager pursuit have so little discretion as to take up an innocent person for a guilty person that if he had not been so unjust as to detain me afterward he believed i would have forgiven the first affront that however it was not in his power to award me any reparation for anything other than by openly reproving them which he should do but he supposed i would apply to such methods as the law directed in the meantime he would bind him over but as to the breach of the peace committed by the journeyman he told me he should give me some satisfaction for that for he should commit him to newgate for assaulting the constable and for assaulting me also accordingly he sent the fellow to newgate for that assault and his master gave bail and so we came away but i had the satisfaction of seeing the mob wait upon them both as they came out hallooing and throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in and so i came home to my governess after this hustle coming home and telling my governess the story she falls at me why are you merry says i the story has not so much laughing room in it as you imagine i am sure i have had a great deal of hurry and fright too with a pack of ugly rogues laugh says my governess i laugh child to see what a lucky creature you are why this job will be the best bargain to you that ever you made in your life if you manage it well i warrant you says she you shall make the mercer pay you for damages besides what you shall get out of the journeyman i had other thoughts of the matter than she had and especially because i had given in my name to the justice of peace and i knew that my name was so well known among the people at hick s hall the old bailey and such places that if this cause came to be tried openly and my name came to be inquired into no court would give much damages for the reputation of a person of such a character however i was obliged to begin a prosecution in form and accordingly my governess found me out a very creditable sort of a man to manage it being an attorney of very good business and of a good reputation and she was certainly in the right of this for had she employed a pettifogging hedge solicitor or a man not known and not in good reputation i should have brought it to but little i met this attorney and gave him all the particulars at large as they are recited above and he assured me it was a case as he said that would very well support itself and that he did not question but that a jury would give very considerable damages on such an occasion so taking his full instructions he began the prosecution and the mercer being arrested gave bail a few days after his giving bail he comes with his attorney to my attorney to let him know that he desired to accommodate the matter that it was all carried on in the heat of an unhappy passion that his client meaning me had a sharp provoking tongue that i used them ill gibing at them and jeering them even while they believed me to be the very person and that i had provoked them and the like my attorney managed as well on my side made them believe i was a widow of fortune that i was able to do myself justice and had great friends to stand by me too who had all made me promise to sue to the utmost and that if it cost me a thousand pounds i would be sure to have satisfaction for that the affronts i had received were insufferable however they brought my attorney to this that he promised he would not blow the coals that if i inclined to accommodation he would not hinder me and that he would rather persuade me to peace than to war for which they told him he should be no loser all which he told me very honestly and told me that if they offered him any bribe i should certainly know it but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if i would take his opinion he would advise me to make it up with them for that as they were in a great fright and were desirous above all things to make it up and knew that let it be what it would they would be allotted to bear all the costs of the suit he believed they would give me freely more than any jury or court of justice would give upon a trial i asked him what he thought they would be brought to he told me he could not tell as to that but he would tell me more when i saw him again some time after this they came again to know if he had talked with me he told them he had that he found me not so averse to an accommodation as some of my friends were who resented the disgrace offered me and set me on that they blowed the coals in secret prompting me to revenge or do myself justice as they called it so that he could not tell what to say to it he told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me but he ought to be able to tell me what proposal they made they pretended they could not make any proposal because it might be made use of against them and he told them that by the same rule he could not make any offers for that might be pleaded in abatement of what damages a jury might be inclined to give however after some discourse and mutual promises that no advantage should be taken on either side by what was transacted then or at any other of those meetings they came to a kind of a treaty but so remote and so wide from one another that nothing could be expected from it for my attorney demanded and charges and they offered without charges so they broke off and the mercer proposed to have a meeting with me myself and my attorney agreed to that very readily my attorney gave me notice to come to this meeting in good clothes and with some state that the mercer might see i was something more than i seemed to be that time they had me accordingly i came in a new suit of second mourning according to what i had said at the justice s i set myself out too as well as a widow s dress in second mourning would admit my governess also furnished me with a good pearl necklace that shut in behind with a locket of diamonds which she had in pawn and i had a very good figure and as i stayed till i was sure they were come i came in a coach to the door with my maid with me when i came into the room the mercer was surprised he stood up and made his bow which i took a little notice of and but a little and went and sat down where my own attorney had pointed to me to sit for it was his house after a little while the mercer said he did not know me again and began to make some compliments his way i told him i believed he did not know me at first and that if he had i believed he would not have treated me as he did he told me he was very sorry for what had happened and that it was to testify the willingness he had to make all possible reparation that he had appointed this meeting that he hoped i would not carry things to extremity which might be not only too great a loss to him but might be the ruin of his business and shop in which case i might have the satisfaction of repaying an injury with an injury ten times greater but that i would then get nothing whereas he was willing to do me any justice that was in his power without putting himself or me to the trouble or charge of a suit at law i told him i was glad to hear him talk so much more like a man of sense than he did before that it was true acknowledgment in most cases of affronts was counted reparation sufficient but this had gone too far to be made up so that i was not revengeful nor did i seek his ruin or any man s else but that all my friends were unanimous not to let me so far neglect my character as to adjust a thing of this kind without a sufficient reparation of honour that to be taken up for a thief was such an indignity as could not be put up that my character was above being treated so by any that knew me but because in my condition of a widow i had been for some time careless of myself and negligent of myself i might be taken for such a creature but that for the particular usage i had from him afterwards and then i repeated all as before it was so provoking i had scarce patience to repeat it well he acknowledged all and was might humble indeed he made proposals very handsome he came up to and to pay all the law charges and added that he would make me a present of a very good suit of clothes i came down to and i demanded that i should publish an advertisement of the particulars in the common newspapers this was a clause he never could comply with however at last he came up by good management of my attorney to and a suit of black silk clothes and there i agree and as it were at my attorney s request complied with it he paying my attorney s bill and charges and gave us a good supper into the bargain when i came to receive the money i brought my governess with me dressed like an old duchess and a gentleman very well dressed who we pretended courted me but i called him cousin and the lawyer was only to hint privately to him that his gentleman courted the widow he treated us handsomely indeed and paid the money cheerfully enough so that it cost him in all or rather more at our last meeting when all was agreed the case of the journeyman came up and the mercer begged very hard for him told me he was a man that had kept a shop of his own and been in good business had a wife and several children and was very poor that he had nothing to make satisfaction with but he should come to beg my pardon on his knees if i desired it as openly as i pleased i had no spleen at the saucy rogue nor were his submissions anything to me since there was nothing to be got by him so i thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not so i told him i did not desire the ruin of any man and therefore at his request i would forgive the wretch it was below me to seek any revenge when we were at supper he brought the poor fellow in to make acknowledgment which he would have done with as much mean humility as his offence was with insulting haughtiness and pride in which he was an instance of a complete baseness of spirit impious cruel and relentless when uppermost and in prosperity abject and lowpirited when down in affliction however i abated his cringes told him i forgave him and desired he might withdraw as if i did not care for the sight of him though i had forgiven him i was now in good circumstances indeed if i could have known my time for leaving off and my governess often said i was the richest of the trade in england and so i believe i was for i had by me in money besides clothes rings some plate and two gold watches and all of them stolen for i had innumerable jobs besides these i have mentioned oh had i even now had the grace of repentance i had still leisure to have looked back upon my follies and have made some reparation but the satisfaction i was to make for the public mischiefs i had done was yet left behind and i could not forbear going abroad again as i called it now than any more i could when my extremity really drove me out for bread it was not long after the affair with the mercer was made up that i went out in an equipage quite different from any i had ever appeared in before i dressed myself like a beggar woman in the coarsest and most despicable rags i could get and i walked about peering and peeping into every door and window i came near and indeed i was in such a plight now that i knew as ill how to behave in as ever i did in any i naturally abhorred dirt and rags i had been bred up tight and cleanly and could be no other whatever condition i was in so that this was the most uneasy disguise to me that ever i put on i said presently to myself that this would not do for this was a dress that everybody was shy and afraid of and i thought everybody looked at me as if they were afraid i should come near them lest i should take something from them or afraid to come near me lest they should get something from me i wandered about all the evening the first time i went out and made nothing of it but came home again wet draggled and tired however i went out again the next night and then i met with a little adventure which had like to have cost me dear as i was standing near a tavern door there comes a gentleman on horseback and lights at the door and wanting to go into the tavern he calls one of the drawers to hold his horse he stayed pretty long in the tavern and the drawer heard his master call and thought he would be angry with him seeing me stand by him he called to me here woman says he hold this horse a while till i go in if the gentleman comes he give you something yes says i and takes the horse and walks off with him very soberly and carried him to my governess this had been a booty to those that had understood it but never was poor thief more at a loss to know what to do with anything that was stolen for when i came home my governess was quite confounded and what to do with the creature we neither of us knew to send him to a stable was doing nothing for it was certain that public notice would be given in the gazette and the horse described so that we durst not go to fetch it again all the remedy we had for this unlucky adventure was to go and set up the horse at an inn and send a note by a porter to the tavern that the gentleman s horse that was lost such a time was left at such an inn and that he might be had there that the poor woman that held him having led him about the street not being able to lead him back again had left him there we might have waited till the owner had published and offered a reward but we did not care to venture the receiving the reward so this was a robbery and no robbery for little was lost by it and nothing was got by it and i was quite sick of going out in a beggar s dress it did not answer at all and besides i thought it was ominous and threatening while i was in this disguise i fell in with a parcel of folks of a worse kind than any i ever sorted with and i saw a little into their ways too these were coiners of money and they made some very good offers to me as to profit but the part they would have had me have embarked in was the most dangerous part i mean that of the very working the die as they call it which had i been taken had been certain death and that at a stake i say to be burnt to death at a stake so that though i was to appearance but a beggar and they promised mountains of gold and silver to me to engage yet it would not do it is true if i had been really a beggar or had been desperate as when i began i might perhaps have closed with it for what care they to die that can t tell how to live but at present this was not my condition at least i was for no such terrible risks as those besides the very thoughts of being burnt at a stake struck terror into my very soul chilled my blood and gave me the vapours to such a degree as i could not think of it without trembling this put an end to my disguise too for as i did not like the proposal so i did not tell them so but seemed to relish it and promised to meet again but i durst see them no more for if i had seen them and not complied though i had declined it with the greatest assurance of secrecy in the world they would have gone near to have murdered me to make sure work and make themselves easy as they call it what kind of easiness that is they may best judge that understand how easy men are that can murder people to prevent danger this and horsetealing were things quite out of my way and i might easily resolve i would have to more to say to them my business seemed to lie another way and though it had hazard enough in it too yet it was more suitable to me and what had more of art in it and more room to escape and more chances for aoming off if a surprise should happen i had several proposals made also to me about that time to come into a gang of housereakers but that was a thing i had no mind to venture at neither any more than i had at the coining trade i offered to go along with two men and a woman that made it their business to get into houses by stratagem and with them i was willing enough to venture but there were three of them already and they did not care to part nor i to have too many in a gang so i did not close with them but declined them and they paid dear for their next attempt but at length i met with a woman that had often told me what adventures she had made and with success at the waterside and i closed with her and we drove on our business pretty well one day we came among some dutch people at st catherine s where we went on pretence to buy goods that were privately got on shore i was two or three times in a house where we saw a good quantity of prohibited goods and my companion once brought away three pieces of dutch black silk that turned to good account and i had my share of it but in all the journeys i made by myself i could not get an opportunity to do anything so i laid it aside for i had been so often that they began to suspect something and were so shy that i saw nothing was to be done this baulked me a little and i resolved to push at something or other for i was not used to come back so often without purchase so the next day i dressed myself up fine and took a walk to the other end of the town i passed through the exchange in the strand but had no notion of finding anything to do there when on a sudden i saw a great cluttering in the place and all the people shopkeepers as well as others standing up and staring and what should it be but some great duchess come into the exchange and they said the queen was coming i set myself close up to a shopide with my back to the counter as if to let the crowd pass by when keeping my eye upon a parcel of lace which the shopkeeper was showing to some ladies that stood by me the shopkeeper and her maid were so taken up with looking to see who was coming and what shop they would go to that i found means to slip a paper of lace into my pocket and come clear off with it so the ladyilliner paid dear enough for her gaping after the queen i went off from the shop as if driven along by the throng and mingling myself with the crowd went out at the other door of the exchange and so got away before they missed their lace and because i would not be followed i called a coach and shut myself up in it i had scarce shut the coach doors up but i saw the milliner s maid and five or six more come running out into the street and crying out as if they were frightened they did not cry stop thief because nobody ran away but i could hear the word robbed and lace two or three times and saw the wench wringing her hands and run staring to and again like one scared the coachman that had taken me up was getting up into the box but was not quite up so that the horse had not begun to move so that i was terrible uneasy and i took the packet of lace and laid it ready to have dropped it out at the flap of the coach which opens before just behind the coachman but to my great satisfaction in less than a minute the coach began to move that is to say as soon as the coachman had got up and spoken to his horses so he drove away without any interruption and i brought off my purchase which was worth near the next day i dressed up again but in quite different clothes and walked the same way again but nothing offered till i came into st james s park where i saw abundance of fine ladies in the park walking in the mall and among the rest there was a little miss a young lady of about twelve or thirteen years old and she had a sister as i suppose it was with her that might be about nine years old i observed the biggest had a fine gold watch on and a good necklace of pearl and they had a footman in livery with them but as it is not usual for the footman to go behind the ladies in the mall so i observed the footman stopped at their going into the mall and the biggest of the sisters spoke to him which i perceived was to bid him be just there when they came back when i heard her dismiss the footman i stepped up to him and asked him what little lady that was and held a little chat with him about what a pretty child it was with her and how genteel and wellarriaged the lady the eldest would be how womanish and how grave and the fool of a fellow told me presently who she was that she was sir thomas s eldest daughter of essex and that she was a great fortune that her mother was not come to town yet but she was with sir william s lady of suffolk at her lodging in suffolk street and a great deal more that they had a maid and a woman to wait on them besides sir thomas s coach the coachman and himself and that young lady was governess to the whole family as well here as at home too and in short told me abundance of things enough for my business i was very well dressed and had my gold watch as well as she so i left the footman and i puts myself in a rank with this young lady having stayed till she had taken one double turn in the mall and was going forward again by and by i saluted her by her name with the title of lady betty i asked her when she heard from her father when my lady her mother would be in town and how she did i talked so familiarly to her of her whole family that she could not suspect but that i knew them all intimately i asked her why she would come abroad without mrs chime with her that was the name of her woma to take of mrs judith that was her sister then i entered into a long chat with her about her sister what a fine little lady she was and asked her if she had learned french and a thousand such little things to entertain her when on a sudden we saw the guards come and the crowd ran to see the king go by to the parliament house the ladies ran all to the side of the mall and i helped my lady to stand upon the edge of the boards on the side of the mall that she might be high enough to see and took the little one and lifted her quite up during which i took care to convey the gold watch so clean away from the lady betty that she never felt it nor missed it till all the crowd was gone and she was gotten into the middle of the mall among the other ladies i took my leave of her in the very crowd and said to her as if in haste dear lady betty take care of your little sister and so the crowd did as it were thrust me away from her and that i was obliged unwillingly to take my leave the hurry in such cases is immediately over and the place clear as soon as the king is gone by but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the king passes so having dropped the two little ladies and done my business with them without any miscarriage i kept hurrying on among the crowd as if i ran to see the king and so i got before the crowd and kept so till i came to the end of the mall when the king going on towards the horse guards i went forward to the passage which went then through against the lower end of the haymarket and there i bestowed a coach upon myself and made off and i confess i have not yet been so good as my word viz to go and visit my lady betty i was once of the mind to venture staying with lady betty till she missed the watch and so have made a great outcry about it with her and have got her into the coach and put myself in the coach with her and have gone home with her for she appeared so fond of me and so perfectly deceived by my so readily talking to her of all her relations and family that i thought it was very easy to push the thing farther and to have got at least the necklace of pearl but when i considered that though the child would not perhaps have suspected me other people might and that if i was searched i should be discovered i thought it was best to go off with what i had got and be satisfied i came accidentally afterwards to hear that when the young lady missed her watch she made a great outcry in the park and sent her footman up and down to see if he could find me out she having described me so perfectly that he knew presently that it was the same person that had stood and talked so long with him and asked him so many questions about them but i gone far enough out of their reach before she could come at her footman to tell him the story i made another adventure after this of a nature different from all i had been concerned in yet and this was at a gamingouse near covent garden i saw several people go in and out and i stood in the passage a good while with another woman with me and seeing a gentleman go up that seemed to be of more than ordinary fashion i said to him sir pray don t they give women leave to go up yes madam says he and to play too if they please i mean so sir said i and with that he said he would introduce me if i had a mind so i followed him to the door and he looking in there madam says he are the gamesters if you have a mind to venture i looked in and said to my comrade aloud here s nothing but men i won t venture among them at which one of the gentlemen cried out you need not be afraid madam here s none but fair gamesters you are very welcome to come and set what you please so i went a little nearer and looked on and some of them brought me a chair and i sat down and saw the box and dice go round apace then i said to my comrade the gentlemen play too high for us come let us go the people were all very civil and one gentleman in particular encouraged me and said come madam if you please to venture if you dare trust me i answer for it you shall have nothing put upon you here no sir said i smiling i hope the gentlemen would not cheat a woman but still i declined venturing though i pulled out a purse with money in it that they might see i did not want money after i had sat a while one gentleman said to me jeering come madam i see you are afraid to venture for yourself i always had good luck with the ladies you shall set for me if you won t set for yourself i told him sir i should be very loth to lose your money though i added i am pretty lucky too but the gentlemen play so high that i dare not indeed venture my own well well says he there s ten guineas madam set them for me so i took his money and set himself looking on i ran out nine of the guineas by one and two at a time and then the box coming to the next man to me my gentleman gave me ten guineas more and made me set five of them at once and the gentleman who had the box threw out so there was five guineas of his money again he was encouraged at this and made me take the box which was a bold venture however i held the box so long that i had gained him his whole money and had a good handful of guineas in my lap and which was the better luck when i threw out i threw but at one or two of those that had set me and so went off easy when i was come this length i offered the gentleman all the gold for it was his own and so would have had him play for himself pretending i did not understand the game well enough he laughed and said if i had but good luck it was no matter whether i understood the game or no but i should not leave off however he took out the fifteen guineas that he had put in at first and bade me play with the rest i would have told them to see how much i had got but he said no no don t tell them i believe you are very honest and tis bad luck to tell them so i played on i understood the game well enough though i pretended i did not and played cautiously it was to keep a good stock in my lap out of which i every now and then conveyed some into my pocket but in such a manner and at such convenient times as i was sure he could not see it i played a great while and had very good luck for him but the last time i held the box they set me high and i threw boldly at all i held the box till i gained near fourscore guineas but lost above half of it back in the last throw so i got up for i was afraid i should lose it all back again and said to him pray come sir now and take it and play for yourself i think i have done pretty well for you he would have had me play on but it grew late and i desired to be excused when i gave it up to him i told him i hoped he would give me leave to tell it now that i might see what i had gained and how lucky i had been for him when i told them there were threescore and three guineas ay says i if it had not been for that unlucky throw i had got you a hundred guineas so i gave him all the money but he would not take it till i had put my hand into it and taken some for myself and bid me please myself i refused it and was positive i would not take it myself if he had a mind to anything of that kind it should be all his own doings the rest of the gentlemen seeing us striving cried give it her all but i absolutely refused that then one of them said n ye jack halve it with her don t you know you should be always upon even terms with the ladies so in short he divided it with me and i brought away thirty guineas besides about fortyhree which i had stole privately which i was sorry for afterward because he was so generous thus i brought home seventyhree guineas and let my old governess see what good luck i had at play however it was her advice that i should not venture again and i took her counsel for i never went there any more for i knew as well as she if the itch of play came in i might soon lose that and all the rest of what i had got fortune had smiled upon me to that degree and i had thriven so much and my governess too for she always had a share with me that really the old gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well and being satisfied with what we had got but i know not what fate guided me i was as backward to it now as she was when i proposed it to her before and so in an ill hour we gave over the thoughts of it for the present and in a word i grew more hardened and audacious than ever and the success i had made my name as famous as any thief of my sort ever had been at newgate and in the old bailey i had sometime taken the liberty to play the same game over again which is not according to practice which however succeeded not amiss but generally i took up new figures and contrived to appear in new shapes every time i went abroad it was not a rumbling time of the year and the gentlemen being most of them gone out of town tunbridge and epsom and such places were full of people but the city was thin and i thought our trade felt it a little as well as other so that at the latter end of the year i joined myself with a gang who usually go every year to stourbridge fair and from thence to bury fair in suffolk we promised ourselves great things there but when i came to see how things were i was weary of it presently for except mere picking of pockets there was little worth meddling with neither if a booty had been made was it so easy carrying it off nor was there such a variety of occasion for business in our way as in london all that i made of the whole journey was a gold watch at bury fair and a small parcel of linen at cambridge which gave me an occasion to take leave of the place it was on old bite and i thought might do with a country shopkeeper though in london it would not i bought at a linenraper s shop not in the fair but in the town of cambridge as much fine holland and other things as came to about seven pounds when i had done i bade them be sent to such an inn where i had purposely taken up my being the same morning as if i was to lodge there that night i ordered the draper to send them home to me about such an hour to the inn where i lay and i would pay him his money at the time appointed the draper sends the goods and i placed one of our gang at the chamber door and when the innkeeper s maid brought the messenger to the door who was a young fellow an apprentice almost a man she tells him her mistress was asleep but if he would leave the things and call in about an hour i should be awake and he might have the money he left the parcel very readily and goes his way and in about half an hour my maid and i walked off and that very evening i hired a horse and a man to ride before me and went to newmarket and from thence got my passage in a coach that was not quite full to st edmund s bury where as i told you i could make but little of my trade only at a little country operaouse made a shift to carry off a gold watch from a lady s side who was not only intolerably merry but as i thought a little fuddled which made my work much easier i made off with this little booty to ipswich and from thence to harwich where i went into an inn as if i had newly arrived from holland not doubting but i should make some purchase among the foreigners that came on shore there but i found them generally empty of things of value except what was in their portmanteaux and dutch hampers which were generally guarded by footmen however i fairly got one of their portmanteaux one evening out of the chamber where the gentleman lay the footman being fast asleep on the bed and i suppose very drunk the room in which i lodged lay next to the dutchman s and having dragged the heavy thing with much ado out of the chamber into mine i went out into the street to see if i could find any possibility of carrying it off i walked about a great while but could see no probability either of getting out the thing or of conveying away the goods that were in it if i had opened it the town being so small and i a perfect stranger in it so i was returning with a resolution to carry it back again and leave it where i found it just in that very moment i heard a man make a noise to some people to make haste for the boat was going to put off and the tide would be spent i called to the fellow what boat is it friend says i that you belong to the ipswich wherry madam says he when do you go off says i this moment madam says he do you want to go thither yes said i if you can stay till i fetch my things where are your things madam says he at such an inn said i well i go with you madam says he very civilly and bring them for you come away then says i and takes him with me the people of the inn were in a great hurry the packetoat from holland being just come in and two coaches just come also with passengers from london for another packetoat that was going off for holland which coaches were to go back next day with the passengers that were just landed in this hurry it was not much minded that i came to the bar and paid my reckoning telling my landlady i had gotten my passage by sea in a wherry these wherries are large vessels with good accommodation for carrying passengers from harwich to london and though they are called wherries which is a word used in the thames for a small boat rowed with one or two men yet these are vessels able to carry twenty passengers and ten or fifteen tons of goods and fitted to bear the sea all this i had found out by inquiring the night before into the several ways of going to london my landlady was very courteous took my money for my reckoning but was called away all the house being in a hurry so i left her took the fellow up to my chamber gave him the trunk or portmanteau for it was like a trunk and wrapped it about with an old apron and he went directly to his boat with it and i after him nobody asking us the least question about it as for the drunken dutch footman he was still asleep and his master with other foreign gentlemen at supper and very merry below so i went clean off with it to ipswich and going in the night the people of the house knew nothing but that i was gone to london by the harwich wherry as i had told my landlady i was plagued at ipswich with the customouse officers who stopped my trunk as i called it and would open and search it i was willing i told them they should search it but husband had the key and he was not yet come from harwich this i said that if upon searching it they should find all the things be such as properly belonged to a man rather than a woman it should not seem strange to them however they being positive to open the trunk i consented to have it be broken open that is to say to have the lock taken off which was not difficult they found nothing for their turn for the trunk had been searched before but they discovered several things very much to my satisfaction as particularly a parcel of money in french pistoles and some dutch ducatoons or rixollars and the rest was chiefly two periwigs wearinginen and razors washalls perfumes and other useful things necessary for a gentleman which all passed for my husband s and so i was quit to them it was now very early in the morning and not light and i knew not well what course to take for i made no doubt but i should be pursued in the morning and perhaps be taken with the things about me so i resolved upon taking new measures i went publicly to an inn in the town with my trunk as i called it and having taken the substance out i did not think the lumber of it worth my concern however i gave it the landlady of the house with a charge to take great care of it and lay it up safe till i should come again and away i walked in to the street when i was got into the town a great way from the inn i met with an ancient woman who had just opened her door and i fell into chat with her and asked her a great many wild questions of things all remote to my purpose and design but in my discourse i found by her how the town was situated that i was in a street that went out towards hadley but that such a street went towards the wateride such a street towards colchester and so the london road lay there i had soon my ends of this old woman for i only wanted to know which was the london road and away i walked as fast as i could not that i intended to go on foot either to london or to colchester but i wanted to get quietly away from ipswich i walked about two or three miles and then i met a plain countryman who was busy about some husbandry work i did not know what and i asked him a great many questions first not much to the purpose but at last told him i was going for london and the coach was full and i could not get a passage and asked him if he could tell me where to hire a horse that would carry double and an honest man to ride before me to colchester that so i might get a place there in the coaches the honest clown looked earnestly at me and said nothing for above half a minute when scratching his poll a horse say you and to colchester to carry double why yes mistress alackay you may have horses enough for money well friend says i that i take for granted i don t expect it without money why but mistress says he how much are you willing to give nay says i again friend i don t know what your rates are in the country here for i am a stranger but if you can get one for me get it as cheap as you can and i give you somewhat for your pains why that s honestly said too says the countryman not so honest neither said i to myself if thou knewest all why mistress says he i have a horse that will carry double and i don t much care if i go myself with you and the like will you says i well i believe you are an honest man if you will i shall be glad of it i pay you in reason why look ye mistress says he i won t be out of reason with you then if i carry you to colchester it will be worth five shillings for myself and my horse for i shall hardly come back toight in short i hired the honest man and his horse but when we came to a town upon the road i do not remember the name of it but it stands upon a rive i pretended myself very ill and i could go no farther that night but if he would stay there with me because i was a stranger i would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart this i did because i knew the dutch gentlemen and their servants would be upon the road that day either in the stagecoaches or riding post and i did not know but the drunken fellow or somebody else that might have seen me at harwich might see me again and so i thought that in one day s stop they would be all gone by we lay all that night there and the next morning it was not very early when i set out so that it was near ten o clock by the time i got to colchester it was no little pleasure that i saw the town where i had so many pleasant days and i made many inquiries after the good old friends i had once had there but could make little out they were all dead or removed the young ladies had been all married or gone to london the old gentleman and the old lady that had been my early benefactress all dead and which troubled me most the young gentleman my first lover and afterwards my brothernaw was dead but two sons men grown were left of him but they too were transplanted to london i dismissed my old man here and stayed incognito for three or four days in colchester and then took a passage in a waggon because i would not venture being seen in the harwich coaches but i needed not have used so much caution for there was nobody in harwich but the woman of the house could have known me nor was it rational to think that she considering the hurry she was in and that she never saw me but once and that by candlelight should have ever discovered me i was now returned to london and though by the accident of the last adventure i got something considerable yet i was not fond of any more country rambles nor should i have ventured abroad again if i had carried the trade on to the end of my days i gave my governess a history of my travels she liked the harwich journey well enough and in discoursing of these things between ourselves she observed that a thief being a creature that watches the advantages of other people s mistakes tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many opportunities must happen and therefore she thought that one so exquisitely keen in the trade as i was would scarce fail of something extraordinary wherever i went on the other hand every branch of my story if duly considered may be useful to honest people and afford a due caution to people of some sort or other to guard against the like surprises and to have their eyes about them when they have to do with strangers of any kind for tis very seldom that some snare or other is not in their way the moral indeed of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses and judgment of the reader i am not qualified to preach to them let the experience of one creature completely wicked and completely miserable be a storehouse of useful warning to those that read i am drawing now towards a new variety of the scenes of life upon my return being hardened by a long race of crime and success unparalleled at least in the reach of my own knowledge i had as i have said no thoughts of laying down a trade which if i was to judge by the example of other must however end at last in misery and sorrow it was on the christmas day following in the evening that to finish a long train of wickedness i went abroad to see what might offer in my way when going by a working silversmith s in foster lane i saw a tempting bait indeed and not be resisted by one of my occupation for the shop had nobody in it as i could see and a great deal of loose plate lay in the window and at the seat of the man who usually as i suppose worked at one side of the shop i went boldly in and was just going to lay my hand upon a piece of plate and might have done it and carried it clear off for any care that the men who belonged to the shop had taken of it but an officious fellow in a house not a shop on the other side of the way seeing me go in and observing that there was nobody in the shop comes running over the street and into the shop and without asking me what i was or who seizes upon me an cries out for the people of the house i had not as i said above touched anything in the shop and seeing a glimpse of somebody running over to the shop i had so much presence of mind as to knock very hard with my foot on the floor of the house and was just calling out too when the fellow laid hands on me however as i had always most courage when i was in most danger so when the fellow laid hands on me i stood very high upon it that i came in to buy half a dozen of silver spoons and to my good fortune it was a silversmith s that sold plate as well as worked plate for other shops the fellow laughed at that part and put such a value upon the service that he had done his neighbour that he would have it be that i came not to buy but to steal and raising a great crowd i said to the master of the shop who by this time was fetched home from some neighbouring place that it was in vain to make noise and enter into talk there of the case the fellow had insisted that i came to steal and he must prove it and i desired we might go before a magistrate without any more words for i began to see i should be too hard for the man that had seized me the master and mistress of the shop were really not so violent as the man from t other side of the way and the man said mistress you might come into the shop with a good design for aught i know but it seemed a dangerous thing for you to come into such a shop as mine is when you see nobody there and i cannot do justice to my neighbour who was so kind to me as not to acknowledge he had reason on his side though upon the whole i do not find you attempted to take anything and i really know not what to do in it i pressed him to go before a magistrate with me and if anything could be proved on me that was like a design of robbery i should willingly submit but if not i expected reparation just while we were in this debate and a crowd of people gathered about the door came by sir t b an alderman of the city and justice of the peace and the goldsmith hearing of it goes out and entreated his worship to come in and decide the case give the goldsmith his due he told his story with a great deal of justice and moderation and the fellow that had come over and seized upon me told his with as much heat and foolish passion which did me good still rather than harm it came then to my turn to speak and i told his worship that i was a stranger in london being newly come out of the north that i lodged in such a place that i was passing this street and went into the goldsmith s shop to buy half a dozen of spoons by great luck i had an old silver spoon in my pocket which i pulled out and told him i had carried that spoon to match it with half a dozen of new ones that it might match some i had in the country that seeing nobody i the shop i knocked with my foot very hard to make the people hear and had also called aloud with my voice tis true there was loose plate in the shop but that nobody could say i had touched any of it or gone near it that a fellow came running into the shop out of the street and laid hands on me in a furious manner in the very moments while i was calling for the people of the house that if he had really had a mind to have done his neighbour any service he should have stood at a distance and silently watched to see whether i had touched anything or no and then have clapped in upon me and taken me in the fact that is very true says mr alderman and turning to the fellow that stopped me he asked him if it was true that i knocked with my foot he said yes i had knocked but that might be because of his coming nay says the alderman taking him short now you contradict yourself for just now you said she was in the shop with her back to you and did not see you till you came upon her now it was true that my back was partly to the street but yet as my business was of a kind that required me to have my eyes every way so i really had a glance of him running over as i said before though he did not perceive it after a full hearing the alderman gave it as his opinion that his neighbour was under a mistake and that i was innocent and the goldsmith acquiesced in it too and his wife and so i was dismissed but as i was going to depart mr alderman said but hold madam if you were designing to buy spoons i hope you will not let my friend here lose his customer by the mistake i readily answered no sir i buy the spoons still if he can match my odd spoon which i brought for a pattern and the goldsmith showed me some of the very same fashion so he weighed the spoons and they came to fivendhirty shillings so i pulls out my purse to pay him in which i had near twenty guineas for i never went without such a sum about me whatever might happen and i found it of use at other times as well as now when mr alderman saw my money he said well madam now i am satisfied you were wronged and it was for this reason that i moved you should buy the spoons and stayed till you had bought them for if you had not had money to pay for them i should have suspected that you did not come into the shop with an intent to buy for indeed the sort of people who come upon these designs that you have been charged with are seldom troubled with much gold in their pockets as i see you are i smiled and told his worship that then i owed something of his favour to my money but i hoped he saw reason also in the justice he had done me before he said yes he had but this had confirmed his opinion and he was fully satisfied now of my having been injured so i came off with flying colours though from an affair in which i was at the very brink of destruction it was but three days after this that not at all made cautious by my former danger as i used to be and still pursuing the art which i had so long been employed in i ventured into a house where i saw the doors open and furnished myself as i though verily without being perceived with two pieces of flowered silks such as they call brocaded silk very rich it was not a mercer s shop nor a warehouse of a mercer but looked like a private dwellingouse and was it seems inhabited by a man that sold goods for the weavers to the mercers like a broker or factor that i may make short of this black part of this story i was attacked by two wenches that came openouthed at me just as i was going out at the door and one of them pulled me back into the room while the other shut the door upon me i would have given them good words but there was no room for it two fiery dragons could not have been more furious than they were they tore my clothes bullied and roared as if they would have murdered me the mistress of the house came next and then the master and all outrageous for a while especially i gave the master very good words told him the door was open and things were a temptation to me that i was poor and distressed and poverty was when many could not resist and begged him with tears to have pity on me the mistress of the house was moved with compassion and inclined to have let me go and had almost persuaded her husband to it also but the saucy wenches were run even before they were sent and had fetched a constable and then the master said he could not go back i must go before a justice and answered his wife that he might come into trouble himself if he should let me go the sight of the constable indeed struck me with terror and i thought i should have sunk into the ground i fell into faintings and indeed the people themselves thought i would have died when the woman argued again for me and entreated her husband seeing they had lost nothing to let me go i offered him to pay for the two pieces whatever the value was though i had not got them and argued that as he had his goods and had really lost nothing it would be cruel to pursue me to death and have my blood for the bare attempt of taking them i put the constable in mind that i had broke no doors nor carried anything away and when i came to the justice and pleaded there that i had neither broken anything to get in nor carried anything out the justice was inclined to have released me but the first saucy jade that stopped me affirming that i was going out with the goods but that she stopped me and pulled me back as i was upon the threshold the justice upon that point committed me and i was carried to newgate that horrid place my very blood chills at the mention of its name the place where so many of my comrades had been locked up and from whence they went to the fatal tree the place where my mother suffered so deeply where i was brought into the world and from whence i expected no redemption but by an infamous death to conclude the place that had so long expected me and which with so much art and success i had so long avoided i was not fixed indeed tis impossible to describe the terror of my mind when i was first brought in and when i looked around upon all the horrors of that dismal place i looked on myself as lost and that i had nothing to think of but of going out of the world and that with the utmost infamy the hellish noise the roaring swearing and clamour the stench and nastiness and all the dreadful crowd of afflicting things that i saw there joined together to make the place seem an emblem of hell itself and a kind of an entrance into it now i reproached myself with the many hints i had had as i have mentioned above from my own reason from the sense of my good circumstances and of the many dangers i had escaped to leave off while i was well and how i had withstood them all and hardened my thoughts against all fear it seemed to me that i was hurried on by an inevitable and unseen fate to this day of misery and that now i was to expiate all my offences at the gallows that i was now to give satisfaction to justice with my blood and that i was come to the last hour of my life and of my wickedness together these things poured themselves in upon my thoughts in a confused manner and left me overwhelmed with melancholy and despair them i repented heartily of all my life past but that repentance yielded me no satisfaction no peace no not in the least because as i said to myself it was repenting after the power of further sinning was taken away i seemed not to mourn that i had committed such crimes and for the fact as it was an offence against god and my neighbour but i mourned that i was to be punished for it i was a penitent as i thought not that i had sinned but that i was to suffer and this took away all the comfort and even the hope of my repentance in my own thoughts i got no sleep for several nights or days after i came into that wretched place and glad i would have been for some time to have died there though i did not consider dying as it ought to be considered neither indeed nothing could be filled with more horror to my imagination than the very place nothing was more odious to me than the company that was there oh if i had but been sent to any place in the world and not to newgate i should have thought myself happy in the next place how did the hardened wretches that were there before me triumph over me what mrs flanders come to newgate at last what mrs mary mrs molly and after that plain moll flanders they thought the devil had helped me they said that i had reigned so long they expected me there many years ago and was i come at last then they flouted me with my dejections welcomed me to the place wished me joy bid me have a good heart not to be cast down things might not be so bad as i feared and the like then called for brandy and drank to me but put it all up to my score for they told me i was but just come to the college as they called it and sure i had money in my pocket though they had none i asked one of this crew how long she had been there she said four months i asked her how the place looked to her when she first came into it just as it did now to you says she dreadful and frightful that she thought she was in hell and i believe so still adds she but it is natural to me now i don t disturb myself about it i suppose says i you are in no danger of what is
