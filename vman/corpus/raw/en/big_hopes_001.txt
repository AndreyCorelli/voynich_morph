my father s family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than pip so i called myself pip and came to be called pip i give pirrip as my father s family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sister mrs joe gargery who married the blacksmith as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photograph my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones the shape of the letters on my father s gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man with curly black hair from the character and turn of the inscription also georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly to five little stone lozenges each about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle i am indebted for a belief i religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousersockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river wound twenty miles of the sea my first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening at such a time i found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was pip hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch keep still you little devil or i cut your throat a fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg a man with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his head a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin oh don t cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror pray don t do it sir tell us your name said the man quick pip sir once more said the man staring at me give it mouth pip pip sir show us where you live said the man pint out the place i pointed to where our village lay on the flat inhore among the alderrees and pollards a mile or more from the church the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and emptied my pockets there was nothing in them but a piece of bread when the church came to itself for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my feet when the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my years and not strong darn me if i couldn t eat em said the man with a threatening shake of his head and if i han t half a mind to t i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn t and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying now lookee here said the man where s your mother there sir said i he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder there sir i timidly explained also georgiana that s my mother oh said he coming back and is that your father alonger your mother yes sir said i him too late of this parish ha he muttered then considering who ye live with supposin you re kindly let to live which i han t made up my mind about my sister sir mrs joe gargery wife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir blacksmith eh said he and looked down at his leg after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine and mine looked most helplessly up into his now lookee here he said the question being whether you re to be let to live you know what a file is yes sir and you know what wittles is yes sir after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger you get me a file he tilted me again and you get me wittles he tilted me again you bring em both to me he tilted me again or i have your heart and liver out he tilted me again i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps i shouldn t be sick and perhaps i could attend more he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped over its own weathercock then he held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms you bring me toorrow morning early that file and them wittles you bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate now i ain t alone as you may think i am there s a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel that young man hears the words i speak that young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man a boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty i find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside now what do you say i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in the morning say lord strike you dead if you don t said the man i said so and he took me down now he pursued you remember what you ve undertook and you remember that young man and you get home gooood night sir i faltered much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat i wish i was a frog or a at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms clasping himself as if to hold himself together and limped towards the low church wall as i saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me when i saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of my legs but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there for steppinglaces when the rains were heavy or the tide was in the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed on the edge of the river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered like an unhooped cask upon a pole an ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate the man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again it gave me a terrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too i looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping chapter my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she was not a goodooking woman my sister and i had a general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites he was a mild goodatured sweetempered easyoing foolish dear fellow a sort of hercules in strength and also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmegrater instead of soap she was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joe s forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country were most of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and she s out now making it a baker s dozen is she yes pip said joe and what s worse she s got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxnded piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she ramaged out that s what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it she ramaged out pip has she been gone long joe i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock she s been on the ramage this last spell about five minutes pip she s aoming get behind the door old chap and have the jackowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing me i often served as a connubial missile at joe who glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg where have you been you young monkey said mrs joe stamping her foot tell me directly what you ve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit or i have you out of that corner if you was fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and rubbing myself churchyard repeated my sister if it warn t for me you have been to the churchyard long ago and stayed there who brought you up by hand you did said i and why did i do it i should like to know exclaimed my sister i whimpered i don t know i don t said my sister i never do it again i know that i may truly say i ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were it s bad enough to be a blacksmith s wife and him a garger without being your mother my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at the fire for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me in the avenging coals hah said mrs joe restoring tickler to his station churchyard indeed you may well say churchyard you two one of us by the by had not said it at all you drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one of these days and o a precious pair you be without me as she applied herself to set the teahings joe peeped down at me over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed after that he sat feeling his rightide flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs joe about with his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us that never varied first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib where it sometimes got a pin into it and sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths then she took some butter not too muc on a knife and spread it on the loaf in an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plaster using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust then she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into two halves of which joe got one and i the other on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my slice i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man i knew mrs joe s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe therefore i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i found to be quite awful it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe in our alreadyentioned freemasonry as fellowufferers and in his goodatured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each other s admiration now and then which stimulated us to new exertions toight joe several times invited me by the display of his fast diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and my untouched bread and butter on the other at last i desperately considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at me and got my bread and butter down my leg joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he didn t seem to enjoy he turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like a pill he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw that my bread and butter was gone the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sister s observation what s the matter now said she smartly as she put down her cup i say you know muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance pip old chap you do yourself a mischief it stick somewhere you can t have chawed it pip what s the matter now repeated my sister more sharply than before if you can cough any trifle on it up pip i recommend you to do it said joe all aghast manners is manners but still your elth s your elth by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily on now perhaps you mention what s the matter said my sister out of breath you staring great stuck pig joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and looked at me again you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone you and me is always friends and i be the last to tell upon you any time but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us and then again at me such a most oncommon bolt as that been bolting his food has he cried my sister you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at mrs joe with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your age frequent and as a boy i ve been among a many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet pip and it s a mercy you ain t bolted dead my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed some medical beast had revived tarater in those days as a fine medicine and mrs joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness at the best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new fence on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater comfort while mrs joe held my head under her arm as a boot would be held in a bootjack joe got off with half a pint but was made to swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fir because he had had a turn judging from myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had none before conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in the case of a boy that secret burden coperates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testif a great punishment the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs joe i never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind then as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy declaring that he couldn t and wouldn t starve until toorrow but must be fed now at other times i thought what if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver toight instead of toorrow if ever anybody s hair stood on end with terror mine must have done so then but perhaps nobody s ever did it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with a coppertick from seven to eight by the dutch clock i tried it with the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his le and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable happily i slipped away and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom hark said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed was that great guns joe ah said joe there s another conwict off what does that mean joe said i mrs joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly escaped escaped administering the definition like tarater while mrs joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my mouth into the forms of saying to joe what s a convict joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i could make out nothing of it but the single word pip there was a conwict off last night said joe aloud after sunsetun and they fired warning of him and now it appears they re firing warning of another who s firing said i drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work what a questioner he is ask no questions and you be told no lies it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be told lies by her even if i did ask questions but she never was polite unless there was company at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like sulks therefore i naturally pointed to mrs joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her but joe wouldn t hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it but i could make nothing of the word mrs joe said i as a last resort i should like to know if you wouldn t much mind where the firing comes from lord bless the boy exclaimed my sister as if she didn t quite mean that but rather the contrary from the hulks oh said i looking at joe hulks joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so and please what s hulks said i that s the way with this boy exclaimed my sister pointing me out with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me answer him one question and he ask you a dozen directly hulks are prisonhips right cross th meshes we always used that name for marshes in our country i wonder who s put into prisonhips and why they re put there said i in a general way and with quiet desperation it was too much for mrs joe who immediately rose i tell you what young fellow said she i didn t bring you up by hand to badger people s lives out it would be blame to me and not praise if i had people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob and forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking questions now you get along to bed i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs in the dark with my head tingling from mrs joe s thimble having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last words i felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me i was clearly on my way there i had begun by asking questions and i was going to rob mrs joe since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror i was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had no hope of deliverance through my allowerful sister who repulsed me at every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on requirement in the secrecy of my terror if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong springide to the hulks a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speakingrumpet as i passed the gibbettation that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at once and not put it off i was afraid to sleep even if i had been inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob the pantry there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting a light by easy friction then to have got one i must have struck it out of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with grey i got up and went downstairs every board upon the way and every crack in every board calling after me stop thief and get up mrs joe in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half turned winking i had no time for verification no time for selection no time for anything for i had no time to spare i stole some bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in my pocketandkerchief with my last night s slic some brandy from a stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid spanishiquoriceater up in my room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboar a meat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round compact pork pie i was nearly going away without the pie but i was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and i took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would not be missed for some time there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joe s tools then i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which i had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the misty marshes chapter it was a rimy morning and very damp i had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all night and using the window for a pocketandkerchief now i saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade on every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village a direction which they never accepted for they never came there was invisible to me until i was quite close under it then as i looked up at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the hulks the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind the gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly as could be a boy with somebody else s pork pie stop him the cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief one black ox with a white cravat on who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air fixed me so obstinately with his eyes and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved round that i blubbered out to him i couldn t help it sir it wasn t for myself i took it upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kickp of his hindegs and a flourish of his tail all this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i went i couldn t warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet i knew my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when i was prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to the right and consequently had to try back along the riveride on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding forward heavy with sleep i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but another man and yet this man was dressed in coarse grey too and had a great iron on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that the other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat broadrimmed lowrowned felt hat on all this i saw in a moment for i had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at me it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down for it made him stumble and then he ran into the mist stumbling twice as he went and i lost him it s the young man i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified him i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had known where it was i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right man hugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping waiting for me he was awfully cold to be sure i half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle he did not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets what s in the bottle boy said he brandy said i he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry than a man who was eating it but he left off to take some of the liquor he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth without biting it off i think you have got the ague said i i much of your opinion boy said he it s bad about here i told him you ve been lying out on the meshes and they re dreadful aguish rheumatic too i eat my breakfast afore they re the death of me said he i do that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there directly afterwards i beat the shivers so far i bet you he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us and often stopping even stopping his jaws to listen some real or fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly you re not a deceiving imp you brought no one with you no sir no nor giv no one the office to follow you no well said he i believe you you be but a fierce young hound indeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock and was going to strike and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it did you speak i said i was glad you enjoyed it thankee my boy i do i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now noticed a decided similarity between the dog s way of eating and the man s the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog he swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought there was danger in every direction of somebody s coming to take the pie away he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor in all of which particulars he was very like the dog i am afraid you won t leave any of it for him said i timidly after a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark there s no more to be got where that came from it was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint leave any for him who s him said my friend stopping in his crunching of pierust the young man that you spoke of that was hid with you oh ah he returned with something like a gruff laugh him yes yes he don t want no wittles i thought he looked as if he did said i the man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise looked when just now where yonder said i pointing over there where i found him nodding asleep and thought it was you he held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived dressed like you you know only with a hat i explained trembling and and i was very anxious to put this delicately and with the same reason for wanting to borrow a file didn t you hear the cannon last night then there was firing he said to himself i wonder you shouldn t have been sure of that i returned for we heard it up at home and that s farther away and we were shut in besides why see now said he when a man s alone on these flats with a light head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears nothin all night but guns firing and voices calling hears he sees the soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore closing in round him hears his number called hears himself challenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders make ready present cover him steady men and is laid hands on and there s nothin why if i see one pursuing party last night coming up in order damn em with their tramp tramp i see a hundred and as to firing why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad day but this man he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my being there did you notice anything in him he had a badly bruised face said i recalling what i hardly knew i knew not here exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly with the flat of his hand yes there where is he he crammed what little food was left into the breast of his grey jacket show me the way he went i pull him down like a bloodhound curse this iron on my sore leg give us hold of the file boy i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man and he looked up at it for an instant but he was down on the rank wet grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file i was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer i told him i must go but he took no notice so i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off the last i saw of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg the last i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still going chapter i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me up but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery mrs joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustan an article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment and where the deuce ha you been was mrs joe s christmas salutation when i and my conscience showed ourselves i said i had been down to hear the carols ah well observed mrs joe you might ha done worse not a doubt of that i thought perhaps if i warn t a blacksmith s wife and what s the same thin a slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols said mrs joe i rather partial to carols myself and that s the best of reasons for my never hearing any joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air when mrs joe darted a look at him and when her eyes were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them to me as our token that mrs joe was in a cross temper this was so much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls a handsome minceie had been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not being misse and the pudding was already on the boil these extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast for i ain t said mrs joe i ain t aoing to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what i ve got before me i promise you so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser in the meantime mrs joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage which was never uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantelhelf each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other mrs joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by their religion my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that is to say joe and i were going in his workinglothes joe was a wellnit characteristicooking blacksmith in his holiday clothes he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and everything that he wore then grazed him on the present festive occasion he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials as to me i think my sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthda and delivered over to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends even when i was taken to have a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds yet what i suffered outside was nothing to what i underwent within the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment i conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said ye are now to declare it would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry i am far from being sure that i might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday mr wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr hubble the wheelwright and mrs hubble and uncle pumblechook joe s uncle but mrs joe appropriated hi who was a welloo cornchandler in the nearest town and drove his own chaiseart the dinner hour was halfast one when joe and i got home we found the table laid and mrs joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked it never was at any other tim for the company to enter by and everything most splendid and still not a word of the robbery the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and the company came mr wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would not despair of making his mark in it the church not being thrown open he was as i have said our clerk but he punished the amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalm always giving the whole verse he looked all round the congregation first as much as to say you have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this style i opened the door to the company making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door and i opened it first to mr wopsle next to mr and mrs hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook n b i was not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties mrs joe said uncle pumblechook a large hardreathing middleged slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the compliments of the season i have brought you mum a bottle of sherry wine and i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumbells every christmas day mrs joe replied as she now replied o un cle pumle chook this is kind every christmas day he retorted as he now retorted it s no more than your merits and now are you all bobbish and how s sixpennorth of halfpence meaning me we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlour which was a change very like joe s change from his workinglothes to his sunday dress my sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of mrs hubble than in other company i remember mrs hubble as a little curly sharpdged person in skylue who held a conventionally juvenile position because she had married mr hubble i don t know at what remote period when she was much younger than he i remember mr hubble as a tough highhouldered stooping old man of a sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in my short days i always saw some miles of open country between them when i met him coming up the lane among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadn t robbed the pantry in a false position not because i was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak i didn t want to spea nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain no i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone but they wouldn t leave me alone they seemed to think the opportunity lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and then and stick the point into me i might have been an unfortunate little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads it began the moment we sat down to dinner mr wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation as it now appears to me something like a religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the third and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low reproachful voice do you hear that be grateful especially said mr pumblechook be grateful boy to them which brought you up by hand mrs hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the young are never grateful this moral mystery seemed too much for the company until mr hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally wicious everybody then murmured true and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner joe s station and influence were something feebler if possibl when there was company than when there was none but he always aided and comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so at dinnerime by giving me gravy if there were any there being plenty of gravy toay joe spooned into my plate at this point about half a pint a little later on in the dinner mr wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity and intimated in the usual hypothetical case of the church being thrown open what kind of sermon he would have given them after favouring them with some heads of that discourse he remarked that he considered the subject of the day s homily ill chosen which was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects going about true again said uncle pumblechook you ve hit it sir plenty of subjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their tails that s what s wanted a man needn t go far to find a subject if he s ready with his saltox mr pumblechook added after a short interval of reflection look at pork alone there s a subject if you want a subject look at pork true sir many a moral for the young returned mr wopsle and i knew he was going to lug me in before he said it might be deduced from that text you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis joe gave me some more gravy swine pursued mr wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian name swine were the companions of the prodigal the gluttony of swine is put before us as an example to the young i thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy what is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy or girl suggested mr hubble of course or girl mr hubble assented mr wopsle rather irritably but there is no girl present besides said mr pumblechook turning sharp on me think what you ve got to be grateful for if you been born a squeaker he was if ever a child was said my sister most emphatically joe gave me some more gravy well but i mean a fourooted squeaker said mr pumblechook if you had been born such would you have been here now not you unless in that form said mr wopsle nodding towards the dish but i don t mean in that form sir returned mr pumblechook who had an objection to being interrupted i mean enjoying himself with his elders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and rolling in the lap of luxury would he have been doing that no he wouldn t and what would have been your destination turning on me again you would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoatocket and he would have shed your blood and had your life no bringing up by hand then not a bit of it joe offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take he was a world of trouble to you ma am said mrs hubble commiserating my sister trouble echoed my sister trouble and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts of sleeplessness i had committed and all the high places i had tumbled from and all the low places i had tumbled into and all the injuries i had done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and i had contumaciously refused to go there i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence anyhow mr wopsle s roman nose so aggravated me during the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it until he howled but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister s recital and in which pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully consciou with indignation and abhorrence yet said mr pumblechook leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed pork regarded as biled is rich too ain t it have a little brandy uncle said my sister o heavens it had come at last he would find it was weak he would say it was weak and i was lost i held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth with both hands and awaited my fate my sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle and poured his brandy out no one else taking any the wretched man trifled with his glass took it up looked at it through the light put it down prolonged my misery all this time mrs joe and joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding i couldn t keep my eyes off him always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the brandy off instantly afterwards the company were seized with unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingough dance and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces and apparently out of his mind i held on tight while mrs joe and joe ran to him i didn t know how i had done it but i had no doubt i had murdered him somehow in my dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp tar i had filled up the bottle from the tarater jug i knew he would be worse by and by i moved the table like a medium of the present day by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it tar cried my sister in amazement why how ever could tar come there but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldn t hear the word wouldn t hear of the subject imperiously waved it all away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water my sister who had begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemoneel and mixing them for the time being at least i was saved i still held on to the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding mr pumblechook partook of pudding all partook of pudding the course terminated and mr pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water i began to think i should get over the day when my sister said to joe clean plates cold i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best grace you must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious present of uncle pumblechook s must they let them not hope to taste it you must know said my sister rising it s a pie a savory pork pie the company murmured their compliments uncle pumblechook sensible of having deserved well of his fellowreatures said quite vivaciously all things considered well mrs joe we do our best endeavours let us have a cut at this same pie my sister went out to get it i heard her steps proceed to the pantry i saw mr pumblechook balance his knife i saw reawakening appetite in the roman nostrils of mr wopsle i heard mr hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip i have never been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company i felt that i could bear no more and that i must run away i released the leg of the table and ran for my life but i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran headoremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me saying here you are look sharp come on chapter the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butnds of their loaded muskets on our doortep caused the dinnerarty to rise from table in confusion and caused mrs joe rentering the kitchen emptyanded to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of gracious goodness gracious me what s gone with the pie the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs joe stood staring at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses it was the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand and his left on my shoulder excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadn i am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith and pray what might you want with him retorted my sister quick to resent his being wanted at all missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should reply the honour and pleasure of his fine wife s acquaintance speaking for the king i answer a little job done this was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr pumblechook cried audibly good again you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling don t act pretty as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over them joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two hours than one will it then will you set about it at once blacksmith said the offand sergeant as it s on his majesty s service and if my men can bear a hand anywhere they make themselves useful with that he called to his men who came trooping into the kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner and then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands loosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out into the yard all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i was in an agony of apprehension but beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little more of my scattered wits would you give me the time said the sergeant addressing himself to mr pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time it s just gone half past two that s not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if i was forced to halt here nigh two hours that do how far might you call yourselves from the marshes hereabouts not above a mile i reckon just a mile said mrs joe that do we begin to close in upon em about dusk a little before dusk my orders are that do convicts sergeant asked mr wopsle in a matterfourse way ay returned the sergeant two they re pretty well known to be out on the marshes still and they won t try to get clear of em before dusk anybody here seen anything of any such game everybody myself excepted said no with confidence nobody thought of me well said the sergeant they find themselves trapped in a circle i expect sooner than they count on now blacksmith if you re ready his majesty the king is joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron on and passed into the forge one of the soldiers opened its wooden windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring then joe began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention but even made my sister liberal she drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy but mr pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum i engage there s no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it was equally convenient when it was given him he drank his majesty s health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips good stuff eh sergeant said mr pumblechook i tell you something returned the sergeant i suspect that stuff s of your providing mr pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay why because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder you re a man that knows what s what ye think so said mr pumblechook with his former laugh have another glass with you hob and nob returned the sergeant the top of mine to the foot of yours the foot of yours to the top of mine ring once ring twice the best tune on the musical glasses your health may you live a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass i noticed that mr pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the bottle from mrs joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality even i got some and he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the same liberality when the first was gone as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was they had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished and now when they were all in lively anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the redot sparks dropped and died the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account poor wretches at last joe s job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped as joe got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt mr pumblechook and mr hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but mr wopsle said he would go if joe would joe said he was agreeable and would take me if mrs joe approved we never should have got leave to go i am sure but for mrs joe s curiosity to know all about it and how it ended as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket don t look to me to put it together again the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from mr pumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman s merits under arid conditions as when something moist was going his men resumed their muskets and fell in mr wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and to speak no word after we reached the marshes when we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably whispered to joe i hope joe we shan t find them and joe whispered to me i give a shilling if they had cut and run pip we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming on and the people had good fires inoors and were keeping the day a few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came out we passed the fingerost and held straight on to the churchyard there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant s hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves and also examined the porch they came in again without finding anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate at the side of the churchyard a bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind and joe took me on his back now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who had brought the soldiers there he had asked me if i was a deceiving imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the hunt against him would he believe that i was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest and had betrayed him it was of no use asking myself this question now there i was on joe s back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a hunter and stimulating mr wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and to keep up with us the soldiers were in front of us extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man we were taking the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain though all of a watery lead colour with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joe s broad shoulder i looked all about for any sign of the convicts i could see none i could hear none mr wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit i got a dreadful start when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a sheepell the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all stopped for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a long shout it was repeated it was at a distance towards the east but it was long and loud nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together if one might judge from a confusion in the sound to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath when joe and i came up after another moment s listening joe who was a good judg agreed and mr wopsle who was a bad judg agreed the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men should make towards it at the double so we slanted to the right where the east wa and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to hold on tight to keep my seat it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he spoke all the time a winder down banks and up banks and over gates and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared where he went as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice sometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped when it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we after them after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one voice calling murder and another voice convicts runaways guard this way for the runaway convicts then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would break out again and when it had come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two of his men ran in close upon him their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in here are both men panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a ditch surrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts come asunder water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other one both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but of course i knew them both directly mind said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers i took him i give him up to you mind that it s not much to be particular about said the sergeant it do you small good my man being in the same plight yourself handcuffs there i don t expect it to do me any good i don t want it to do me more good than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh i took him he knows it that s enough for me the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling take notice guard he tried to murder me were his first words tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully try and not do it i took him and giv him up that s what i done i not only prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him here dragged him this far on his way back he s a gentleman if you please this villain now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me murder him worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag him back the other one still gasped he tried he triedo murder me bear bear witness lookee here said my convict to the sergeant singleanded i got clear of the prisonhip i made a dash and i done it i could ha got clear of these deathold flats likewise look at my leg you won t find much iron on it if i hadn t made the discovery that he was here let him go free let him profit by the means as i found out let him make a tool of me afresh and again once more no no no if i had died at the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands i have held to him with that grip that you should have been safe to find him in my hold the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion repeated he tried to murder me i should have been a dead man if you had not come up he lies said my convict with fierce energy he s a liar born and he die a liar look at his face ain t it written there let him turn those eyes of his on me i defy him to do it the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker do you see him pursued my convict do you see what a villain he is do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes that s how he looked when we were tried together he never looked at me the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with a halfaunting glance at the bound hands at that point my convict became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers didn t i tell you said the other convict then that he would murder me if he could and any one could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes like thin snow enough of this parley said the sergeant light those torches as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time and saw me i had alighted from joe s back on the brink of the ditch when we came up and had not moved since i looked at him eagerly when he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head i had been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my innocence it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it all passed in a moment but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having been more attentive the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four torches and took one himself and distributed the others it had been almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards very dark before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in a ring fired twice into the air presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river all right said the sergeant march we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear you are expected on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming don t straggle my man close up here the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard i had hold of joe s hand now and joe carried one of the torches mr wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so we went on with the party there was a reasonably good path now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluiceate when i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us the torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and i could see those too lying smoking and flaring i could see nothing else but black darkness our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets we could not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three times we had to halt while they rested after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut and a landinglace there was a guard in the hut and they challenged and the sergeant answered then we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their greatoats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again the sergeant made some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board first my convict never looked at me except that once while we stood in the hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures suddenly he turned to the sergeant and remarked i wish to say something respecting this escape it may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it here you have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it before it s done with you know i know but this is another pint a separate matter a man can t starve at least i can t i took some wittles up at the willage over yonder where the church stands a most out on the marshes you mean stole said the sergeant and i tell you where from from the blacksmith s halloa said the sergeant staring at joe halloa pip said joe staring at me it was some broken wittles that s what it was and a dram of liquor and a pie have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked the sergeant confidentially my wife did at the very moment when you came in don t you know pip so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and without the least glance at me so you re the blacksmith are you than i sorry to say i ve eat your pie god knows you re welcome to it so far as it was ever mine returned joe with a saving remembrance of mrs joe we don t know what you have done but we wouldn t have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellowreatur would us pip the something that i had noticed before clicked in the man s throat again and he turned his back the boat had returned and his guard were ready so we followed him to the landinglace made of rough stakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself no one seemed surprised to see him or interested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way you which was the signal for the dip of the oars by the light of the torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore like a wicked noah s ark cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains the prisonhip seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners we saw the boat go alongside and we saw him taken up the side and disappear then the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with him chapter my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to mrs joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me but i loved joe perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him and as to him my inner self was not so easily composed it was much upon my mind particularly when i first saw him looking about for his fil that i ought to tell joe the whole truth yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that if i did he would think me worse than i was the fear of losing joe s confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my tongue i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker without thinking that he was meditating on it that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterday s meat or pudding when it came on toay s table without thinking that he was debating whether i had been in the pantry that if joe knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face in a word i was too cowardly to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing what i knew to be wrong i had had no intercourse with the world at that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of action for myself as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonhip joe took me on his back again and carried me home he must have had a tiresome journey of it for mr wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself in his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders and the restorative exclamation yah was there ever such a boy as this from my sister i found joe telling them about the convict s confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry mr pumblechook made out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips and as mr pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaiseart over everybody it was agreed that it must be so mr wopsle indeed wildly cried out no with the feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously set at naught not to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not calculated to inspire confidence this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a slumberous offence to the company s eyesight and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs my state of mind as i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions chapter at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out my construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my father s exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at all accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright s or up by the mill when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs joe called pompeyed or as i render i pampered therefore i was not only oddoy about the forge but if any neighbour happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favoured with the employment in order however that our superior position might not be compromised thereby a moneyox was kept on the kitchen mantelhelf into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped i have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure mr wopsle s greatunt kept an evening school in the village that is to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it she rented a small cottage and mr wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally bumping on the ceiling there was a fiction that mr wopsle examined the scholars once a quarter what he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antony s oration over the body of caesar this was always followed by collins s ode on the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr wopsle as revenge throwing his bloodtained sword in thunder down and taking the warenouncing trumpet with a withering look it was not with me then as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen mr wopsle s greatunt besides keeping this educational institution kept in the same room a little general shop she had no idea what stock she had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little greasy memorandumook kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions biddy was mr wopsle s greatunt s granddaughter i confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was to mr wopsle she was an orphan like myself like me too had been brought up by hand she was most noticeable i thought in respect of her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing her hands always wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel this description must be received with a weekay limitation on sundays she went to church elaborated much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr wopsle s greatunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a brambleush getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition but at last i began in a purblind groping way to read write and cipher on the very smallest scale one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending great efforts on the production of a letter to joe i think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long time after and it was winter and a hard frost with an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle deer jo i ope u r krwite well i ope i shal son b habell teedge u jo an then we shorl b so glodd an wen i prengtd u jo wot larx an bleve me inf xn pip there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone but i delivered this written communication slate and al with my own hand and joe received it as a miracle of erudition i say pip old chap cried joe opening his blue eyes wide what a scholar you are an t you i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly why here s a j said joe and a o equal to anythink here s a j and a o pip and a j joe i had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i accidentally held our prayerook upside down that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah but read the rest jo the rest eh pip said joe looking at it with a slow searching eye one two three why here s three js and three os and three j joes in it pip i leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter astonishing said joe when i had finished you are a scholar how do you spell gargery joe i asked him with a modest patronage i don t spell it at all said joe but supposing you did it can t be supposed said joe tho i uncommon fond of reading too are you joe onommon give me said joe a good book or a good newspaper and sit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better lord he continued after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a j and a o and says you here at last is a j joe how interesting reading is i derived from this that joe s education like steam was yet in its infancy pursuing the subject i inquired didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me no pip why didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me well pip said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars i tell you my father pip he were given to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at my mother most onmerciful it were a most the only hammering he did indeed xcepting at myself and he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn t hammer at his anwil you re a listening and understanding pip yes joe consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several times and then my mother she go out to work and she say joe she say now please god you shall have some schooling child and she put me to school but my father were that good in his hart that he couldn t abear to be without us so he come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him and then he took us home and hammered us which you see pip said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and looking at me were a drawback on my learning certainly poor joe though mind you pip said joe with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart don t you see i didn t see but i didn t say so well joe pursued somebody must keep the pot ailing pip or the pot won t bile don t you know i saw that and said so consequence my father didn t make objections to my going to work so i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit and it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that whatsume er the failings on his part remember reader he were that good in his heart joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself i made it said joe my own self i made it in a moment it was like striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow i never was so much surprised in all my life couldn t credit my own ed to tell you the truth hardly believed it were my own ed as i was saying pip it were my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money cut it how you will small or large and it were not done not to mention bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother she were in poor elth and quite broke she weren t long of following poor soul and her share of peace come round at last joe s blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them and then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the round knob on the top of the poker it were but lonesome then said joe living here alone and i got acquainted with your sister now pip joe looked firmly at me as if he knew i was not going to agree with him your sister is a fine figure of a woman i could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt whatever family opinions or whatever the world s opinions on that subject may be pip your sister is joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following aineigure of a woman i could think of nothing better to say than i am glad you think so joe so am i returned joe catching me up i am glad i think so pip a little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does it signify to me i sagaciously observed if it didn t signify to him to whom did it signify certainly assented joe that s it you re right old chap when i got acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing you up by hand very kind of her too all the folks said and i said along with all the folks as to you joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was dear me you have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself not exactly relishing this i said never mind me joe but i did mind you pip he returned with tender simplicity when i offered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to her and bring the poor little child god bless the poor little child i said to your sister there s room for him at the forge i broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged joe round the neck who dropped the poker to hug me and to say ever the best of friends an t us pip don t cry old chap when this little interruption was over joe resumed well you see pip and here we are that s about where it lights here we are now when you take me in hand in my learning pip and i tell you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dul mrs joe mustn t see too much of what we re up to it must be done as i may say on the sly and why on the sly i tell you why pip he had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration your sister is given to government given to government joe i was startled for i had some shadowy idea and i am afraid i must add hop that joe had divorced her in a favour of the lords of the admiralty or treasury given to government said joe which i meantersay the government of you and myself oh and she an t over partial to having scholars on the premises joe continued and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar for fear as i might rise like a sort of rebel don t you see i was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as why when joe stopped me stay a bit i know what you re aoing to say pip stay a bit i don t deny that your sister comes the moul over us now and again i don t deny that she do throw us backalls and that she do drop down upon us heavy at such times as when your sister is on the ramage pip joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candour compels fur to admit that she is a buster joe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital bs why don t i rise that were your observation when i broke it off pip yes joe well said joe passing the poker into his left hand that he might feel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation your sister s a masterind a masterind what s that i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand but joe was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely stopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look her and i ain t a masterind joe resumed when he had unfixed his look and got back to his whisker and last of all pip and this i want to say very serious to you old chap i see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that i dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what s right by a woman and i fur rather of the two go wrong the t other way and be a little illonwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warn t no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upndownndtraight on it pip and i hope you overlook shortcomings young as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of joe from that night we were equals afterwards as we had been before but afterwards at quiet times when i sat looking at joe and thinking about him i had a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up to joe in my heart however said joe rising to replenish the fire here s the dutchlock aorking himself up to being equal to strike eight of em and she s not come home yet i hope uncle pumblechook s mare mayn t have set a forefoot on a piece o ice and gone down mrs joe made occasional trips with uncle pumblechook on marketays to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman s judgment uncle pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant this was marketay and mrs joe was out on one of these expeditions joe made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to listen for the chaiseart it was a dry cold night and the wind blew keenly and the frost was white and hard a man would die toight of lying out on the marshes i thought and then i looked at the stars and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude here comes the mare said joe ringing like a peal of bells the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual we got a chair out ready for mrs joe s alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place when we had completed these preparations they drove up wrapped to the eyes mrs joe was soon landed and uncle pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire now said mrs joe unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings if this boy ain t grateful this night he never will be i looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression it s only to be hoped said my sister that he won t be pompeyed but i have my fears she ain t in that line mum said mr pumblechook she knows better she i looked at joe making the motion with my lips and eyebrows she joe looked at me making the motion with his lips and eyebrows she my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions and looked at her well said my sister in her snappish way what are you staring at is the house afire which some individual joe politely hinted mentioned she and she is a she i suppose said my sister unless you call miss havisham a he and i doubt if even you go so far as that miss havisham up town said joe is there any miss havisham down town returned my sister she wants this boy to go and play there and of course he s going and he had better play there said my sister shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive or i work him i had heard of miss havisham up town everybody for miles round had heard of miss havisham up town as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who led a life of seclusion well to be sure said joe astounded i wonder how she come to know pip noodle cried my sister who said she knew him which some individual joe again politely hinted mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there and couldn t she ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there isn t it just barely possible that uncle pumblechook may be a tenant of hers and that he may sometimes we won t say quarterly or halfearly for that would be requiring too much of you but sometimes go there to pay his rent and couldn t she then ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there and couldn t uncle pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for us though you may not think it joseph in a tone of the deepest reproach as if he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing prancing here which i solemnly declare i was not doing that i have for ever been a willing slave to good again cried uncle pumblechook well put prettily pointed good indeed now joseph you know the case no joseph said my sister still in a reproachful manner while joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose you do not yet though you may not think it know the case you may consider that you do but you do not joseph for you do not know that uncle pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this boy s fortune may be made by his going to miss havisham s has offered to take him into town toight in his own chaiseart and to keep him toight and to take him with his own hands to miss havisham s toorrow morning and lorussy me cried my sister casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation here i stand talking to mere mooncalfs with uncle pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot with that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of waterutts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside myself i may here remark that i suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a weddinging passing unsympathetically over the human countenance when my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit i was then delivered over to mr pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been dying to make all along boy be forever grateful to all friends but especially unto them which brought you up by hand goodye joe god bless you pip old chap i had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaiseart but they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the questions why on earth i was going to play at miss havisham s and what on earth i was expected to play at chapter mr pumblechook s premises in the high street of the market town were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be it appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the tiedp brown paper packets inside whether the flowereeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this speculation on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys mr pumblechook wore corduroys and so did his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavour about the corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavour about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew which was which the same opportunity served me for noticing that mr pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with a magnifyinglass at his eye and always inspected by a group of smockrocks poring over him through the glass of his shopindow seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade engaged his attention mr pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight o clock in the parlour behind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises i considered mr pumblechook wretched company besides being possessed by my sister s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic on my politely bidding him goodorning he said pompously seven times nine boy and how should i be able to answer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach i was hungry but before i had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast seven and four and eight and six and two and ten and so on and after each figure was disposed of it was as much as i could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if i may be allowed the expressio a gorging and gormandizing manner for such reasons i was very glad when ten o clock came and we started for miss havisham s though i was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which i should acquit myself under that lady s roof within a quarter of an hour we came to miss havisham s house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it some of the windows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were rustily barred there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to open it while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr pumblechook said and fourteen but i pretended not to hear hi and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery no brewing was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name to which my conductor replied pumblechook the voice returned quite right and the window was shut again and a young lady came across the courtard with keys in her hand this said mr pumblechook is pip this is pip is it returned the young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud come in pip mr pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate oh she said did you wish to see miss havisham if miss havisham wished to see me returned mr pumblechook discomfited ah said the girl but you see she don t she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not protest but he eyed me severely as if i had done anything to him and departed with the words reproachfully delivered boy let your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate and sixteen but he didn t my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice the brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt all the strong beer that s brewed there now boy i should think i could miss said i in a shy way better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy don t you think so it looks like it miss not that anybody means to try she added for that s all done with and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls as to strong beer there s enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor house is that the name of this house miss one of its names boy it has more than one then miss one more its other name was satis which is greek or latin or hebrew or all three or all one to me for enough enough house said i that s a curious name miss yes she replied but it meant more than it said it meant when it was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else they must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think but don t loiter boy though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary she was of about my own age she seemed much older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and selfossessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been onendwenty and a queen we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two chains across it outside and the first thing i noticed was that the passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss to this she returned don t be ridiculous boy i am not going in and scornfully walked away and what was worse took the candle with her this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid however the only thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told from within to enter i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty large room well lighted with wax candles no glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it it was a dressingoom as i supposed from the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me but prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookinglass and that i made out at first sight to be a fine lady s dressingable whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it i cannot say in an armhair with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see she was dressed in rich materials satins and lace and silks all of white her shoes were white and she had a long white veil dependent from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was white some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table dresses less splendid than the dress she wore and halfacked trunks were scattered about she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe on the other was on the table near her hand her veil was but half arranged her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some flowers and a prayerook all confusedly heaped about the lookinglass it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed but i saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow i saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone once i had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage lying in state once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement now waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me i should have cried out if i could who is it said the lady at the table pip ma am pip mr pumblechook s boy ma am come to play come nearer let me look at you come close it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine look at me said miss havisham you are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer no do you know what i touch here she said laying her hands one upon the other on her left side yes ma am it made me think of the young man what do i touch your heart broken she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they were heavy i am tired said miss havisham i want diversion and i have done with men and women play i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy that i want to see some play there there with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand play play play for a moment with the fear of my sister s working me before my eyes i had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of mr pumblechook s chaiseart but i felt myself so unequal to the performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when we had taken a good look at each other are you sullen and obstinate no ma am i am very sorry for you and very sorry i can t play just now if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so i would do it if i could but it s so new here and so strange and so fine and melancholy i stopped fearing i might say too much or had already said it and we took another look at each other before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the dress she wore and at the dressingable and finally at herself in the lookinglass so new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so familiar to me so melancholy to both of us call estella as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was still talking to herself and kept quiet call estella she repeated flashing a look at me you can do that call estella at the door to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost as bad as playing to order but she answered at last and her light came along the dark passage like a star miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair your own one day my dear and you will use it well let me see you play cards with this boy with this boy why he is a common labouringoy i thought i overheard miss havisham answer only it seemed so unlikely well you can break his heart what do you play boy asked estella of myself with the greatest disdain nothing but beggar my neighbour miss beggar him said miss havisham to estella so we sat down to cards it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago i noticed that miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressingable again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never been worn i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been trodden ragged without this arrest of everything this standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like gravelothes or the long veil so like a shroud so she sat corpseike as we played at cards the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper i knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust he calls the knaves jacks this boy said estella with disdain before our first game was out and what coarse hands he has and what thick boots i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but i began to consider them a very indifferent pair her contempt for me was so strong that it became infectious and i caught it she won the game and i dealt i misdealt as was only natural when i knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for a stupid clumsy labouringoy you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked on she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her what do you think of her i don t like to say i stammered tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper anything else i think she is very pretty anything else i think she is very insulting she was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion anything else i think i should like to go home and never see her again though she is so pretty i am not sure that i shouldn t like to see her again but i should like to go home now you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud play the game out saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost sure that miss havisham s face could not smile it had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression most likely when all the things about her had become transfixed and it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul within and without under the weight of a crushing blow i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me she threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she despised them for having been won of me when shall i have you here again said miss havisham let me think i was beginning to remind her that toay was wednesday when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand there there i know nothing of days of the week i know nothing of weeks of the year come again after six days you hear yes ma am estella take him down let him have something to eat and let him roam and look about him while he eats go pip i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she stood it in the place where we had found it until she opened the side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must necessarily be nightime the rush of the daylight quite confounded me and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours you are to wait here you boy said estella and disappeared and closed the door i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots my opinion of those accessories was not favourable they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages i determined to ask joe why he had ever taught me to call those pictureards jacks which ought to be called knaves i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then i should have been so too she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer she put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in disgrace i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorry i cannot hit upon the right name for the smart god knows what its name was that tears started to my eyes the moment they sprang there the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptuous toss but with a sense i thought of having made too sure that i was so wounded and left me but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind one of the gates in the breweryane and leaned my sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that needed counteraction my sister s bringing up had made me sensitive in the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice it may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is small and its world is small and its rockingorse stands as many hands high according to scale as a bigoned irish hunter within myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with injustice i had known from the time when i could speak that my sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me i had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks through all my punishments disgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid and very sensitive i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate the bread and meat were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon in spirits to look about me to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeonouse in the breweryard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it but there were no pigeons in the doveot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke in a byard there was a wilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone and in this respect i remember those recluses as being like most others behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked there and that estella was walking away from me even then but she seemed to be everywhere for when i yielded to the temptation presented by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks she had her back towards me and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round and passed out of my view directly so in the brewery itself by which i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were when i first went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going out into the sky it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened to my fancy i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a stranger thing long afterwards i turned my eyes a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure hanging there by the neck a figure all in yellow white with but one shoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was miss havisham s with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me in the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it and my terror was greatest of all when i found no figure there nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the courtard gate and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let me out she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the gate and stood holding it i was passing out without looking at her when she touched me with a taunting hand why don t you cry because i don t want to you do said she you have been crying till you are half blind and you are near crying again now she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me i went straight to mr pumblechook s and was immensely relieved to find him not at home so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was wanted at miss havisham s again i set off on the fourile walk to our forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply revolving that i was a common labouringoy that my hands were coarse that my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had considered myself last night and generally that i was in a lowived bad way chapter when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss havisham s and asked a number of questions and i soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine which i consider probable as i have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity it is the key to many reservations i felt convinced that if i described miss havisham s as my eyes had seen it i should not be understood not only that but i felt convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of miss estell before the contemplation of mrs joe consequently i said as little as i could and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came gaping over in his chaiseart at teaime to have the details divulged to him and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the chair of honour by the fire how did you get on up town i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me pretty well mr pumblechook repeated pretty well is no answer tell us what you mean by pretty well boy whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my obstinacy was adamantine i reflected for some time and then answered as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me i had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forge when mr pumblechook interposed with no don t lose your temper leave this lad to me ma am leave this lad to me mr pumblechook then turned me towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said first to get our thoughts in orde fortyhree pence i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and finding them against me went as near the answer as i could which was somewhere about eightpence off mr pumblechook then put me through my penceable from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had done for me now how much is fortyhree pence to which i replied after a long interval of reflection i don t know and i was so aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know mr pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and said is fortyhree pence seven and sixpence three fardens for instance yes said i and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and brought him to a dead stop boy what like is miss havisham mr pumblechook began again when he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw very tall and dark i told him is she uncle asked my sister mr pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he had never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind good said mr pumblechook conceitedly this is the way to have him we are beginning to hold our own i think mum i am sure uncle returned mrs joe i wish you had him always you know so well how to deal with him now boy what was she aoing of when you went in today asked mr pumblechook she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another as they well might and both repeated in a black velvet coach yes said i and miss estella that s her niece i think handed her in cake and wine at the coachindow on a gold plate and we all had cake and wine on gold plates and i got up behind the coach to eat mine because she told me to was anybody else there asked mr pumblechook four dogs said i large or small immense said i and they fought for vealutlets out of a silver basket mr pumblechook and mrs joe stared at one another again in utter amazement i was perfectly frantic a reckless witness under the torture and would have told them anything where was this coach in the name of gracious asked my sister in miss havisham s room they stared again but there weren t any horses to it i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of harnessing can this be possible uncle asked mrs joe what can the boy mean i tell you mum said mr pumblechook my opinion is it s a sedanhair she s flighty you know very flighty quite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedanhair did you ever see her in it uncle asked mrs joe how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see her in my life never clapped eyes upon her goodness uncle and yet you have spoken to her why don t you know said mr pumblechook testily that when i have been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way don t say you don t know that mum howsever the boy went there to play what did you play at boy we played with flags i said i beg to observe that i think of myself with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion flags echoed my sister yes said i estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out at the coachindow and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed swords repeated my sister where did you get swords from out of a cupboard said i and i saw pistols in it and jam and pills and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up with candles that s true mum said mr pumblechook with a grave nod that s the state of the case for that much i ve seen myself and then they both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery they were so much occupied however in discussing the marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his related my pretended experiences now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only as regarded him not in the least as regarded the other two towards joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat debating what results would come to me from miss havisham s acquaintance and favour they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something for me their doubts related to the form that something would take my sister stood out for property mr pumblechook was in favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade say the corn and seed trade for instance joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealutlets if a fool s head can t express better opinions than that said my sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it so he went after mr pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for the night then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to tell you something should you pip said joe drawing his shoeingtool near the forge then tell us what is it pip joe said i taking hold of his rolledp shirt sleeve and twisting it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss havisham s remember said joe i believe you wonderful it s a terrible thing joe it ain t true what are you telling of pip cried joe falling back in the greatest amazement you don t mean to say it s yes i do it s lies joe but not all of it why sure you don t mean to say pip that there was no black welwet co eh for i stood shaking my head but at least there was dogs pip come pip said joe persuasively if there warn t no wealutlets at least there was dogs no joe a dog said joe a puppy come no joe there was nothing at all of the kind as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay pip old chap this won t do old fellow i say where do you expect to go to it s terrible joe ain t it terrible cried joe awful what possessed you i don t know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head but i wish you hadn t taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i wish my boots weren t so thick nor my hands so coarse and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadn t been able to explain myself to mrs joe and pumblechook who were so rude to me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havisham s who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies had come of it somehow though i didn t know how this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal with as for me but joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics and by that means vanquished it there s one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some rumination namely that lies is lies howsever they come they didn t ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to the same don t you tell no more of em pip that ain t the way to get out of being common old chap and as to being common i don t make it out at all clear you are oncommon in some things you re oncommon small likewise you re a oncommon scholar no i am ignorant and backward joe why see what a letter you wrote last night wrote in print even i ve seen letters ah and from gentlefolks that i swear weren t wrote in print said joe i have learnt next to nothing joe you think much of me it s only that well pip said joe be it so or be it son t you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope the king upon his throne with his crown upon his ed can t sit and write his acts of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted prince with the alphabet ah added joe with a shake of the head that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z and i know what that is to do though i can t say i ve exactly done it there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged me whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe reflectively mightn t be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon ones which reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps no joe i sorry there weren t a flag pi whether that might be or mightn t be is a thing as can t be looked into now without putting your sister on the rampage and that s a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional lookee here pip at what is said to you by a true friend which this to you the true friend say if you can t get to be oncommon through going straight you never get to do it through going crooked so don t tell no more on em pip and live well and die happy you are not angry with me joe no old chap but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort alluding to them which bordered on wealutlets and dogighting a sincere wellisher would adwise pip their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed that s all old chap and don t never do it no more when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget joe s recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and how coarse his hands i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the level of such common doings i fell asleep recalling what i used to do when i was at miss havisham s as though i had been there weeks or months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me but it is the same with any life imagine one selected day struck out of it and think how different its course would have been pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day chapter the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of biddy everything she knew in pursuance of this luminous conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr wopsle s greatunt s at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me biddy who was the most obliging of girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes the educational scheme or course established by mr wopsle s greatunt may be resolved into the following synopsis the pupils ate apples and put straws down one another s backs until mr wopsle s greatunt collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birchod after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and a little spelling that is to say it had had once as soon as this volume began to circulate mr wopsle s greatunt fell into a state of coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm the pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of somethin more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves this part of the course was usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory students when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we could or what we couldn t in a frightful chorus biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we were reading about when this horrible din had lasted a certain time it mechanically awoke mr wopsle s greatunt who staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears this was understood to terminate the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink when there was an but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden and which was also mr wopsle s greatunt s sittingoom and bedchamber being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one lowpirited dipandle and no snuffers it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under these circumstances nevertheless i resolved to try it and that very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle of course there was a publicouse in the village and of course joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there i had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril to the three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to be never paid off they had been there ever since i could remember and had grown more than i had but there was a quantity of chalk about our country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records but as my business was with joe and not with him i merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with mr wopsle and a stranger joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap and the moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me he was a secretooking man whom i had never seen before his head was all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun he had a pipe in his mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time nodded so i nodded and then he nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit down there but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made for me on the opposite settle the strange man after glancing at joe and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his leg in a very odd way as it struck me you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a blacksmith yes i said it you know said joe what you drink mr you didn t mention your name by the bye joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it what you drink mr gargery at my expense to top up with well said joe to tell you the truth i ain t much in the habit of drinking at anybody s expense but my own habit no returned the stranger but once and away and on a saturday night too come put a name to it mr gargery i wouldn t wish to be stiff company said joe rum rum repeated the stranger and will the other gentleman originate a sentiment rum said mr wopsle three rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord glasses round this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing mr wopsle is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out our clerk at church aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me the lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it that s it said joe the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself he wore a flapping broadrimmed traveller s hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair as he looked at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a halfaugh come into his face i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a solitary country towards the river most marshes is solitary said joe no doubt no doubt do you find any gypsies now or tramps or vagrants of any sort out there no said joe none but a runaway convict now and then and we don t find them easy eh mr wopsle mr wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented but not warmly seems you have been out after such asked the stranger once returned joe not that we wanted to take them you understand we went out as lookers on me and mr wopsle and pip didn t us pip yes joe the stranger looked at me again still cocking his eye as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun and said he s a likely young parcel of bones that what is it you call him pip said joe christened pip no not christened pip surname pip no said joe it s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant and is called by son of yours well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes well no no he ain t nevvy said the strange man well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he is not no not to deceive you he is not my nevvy what the blue blazes is he asked the stranger which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength mr wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and joe having his hand in mr wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added as the poet says and here i may remark that when mr wopsle referred to me he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances yet i do not call to mind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle but some largeanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronise me all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me down but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his shot and a most extraordinary shot it was it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumbhow and was pointedly addressed to me he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me and he stirred it and he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file he did this so that nobody but i saw the file and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breastocket i knew it to be joe s file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the instrument i sat gazing at him spellound but he now reclined on his settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about turnips there was a delicious sense of cleaningp and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays than at other times the halfour and the rum and water running out together joe got up to go and took me by the hand stop half a moment mr gargery said the strange man i think i ve got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy shall have it he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me yours said he mind your own i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners and holding tight to joe he gave joe goodight and he gave mr wopsle goodight who went out with u and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye no not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it on the way home if i had been in a humour for talking the talk must have been all on my side for mr wopsle parted from us at the door of the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible but i was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance and could think of nothing else my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling a bad un i be bound said mrs joe triumphantly or he wouldn t have given it to the boy let s look at it i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one but what s this said mrs joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper two oneound notes nothing less than two fat sweltering oneound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlearkets in the county joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly bargemen to restore them to their owner while he was gone i sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under some dried roseeaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlour there they remained a nightmare to me many and many a night and day i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts a feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten i was haunted by the file too a dread possessed me that when i least expected it the file would reappear i coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of miss havisham s next wednesday and in my sleep i saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i screamed myself awake chapter at the appointed time i returned to miss havisham s and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out estella she locked it after admitting me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood she took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously saying you are to come this way toay and took me to quite another part of the house the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the manor house we traversed but one side of the square however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and opened a door here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwellingouse that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery there was a clock in the outer wall of this house like the clock in miss havisham s room and like miss havisham s watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling on the groundloor at the back there was some company in the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and stand there boy till you are wanted there being the window i crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind looking out it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbagetalks and one boxree that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different colour as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt this was my homely thought as i contemplated the boxree there had been some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window as if it pelted me for coming there i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that its other occupants were looking at me i could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the windowlass but i stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman before i had been standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody s pleasure and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found when i caught sight of he of a blunter cast of features indeed when i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my sister s nobody s enemy but his own it would be much more commendable to be somebody else s enemy said the gentleman far more natural cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbour sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own neighbour who is miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yaw the idea but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and emphatically very true poor soul camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking at me in the mean tim he is so very strange would anyone believe that when tom s wife died he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children s having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning good lord says he camilla what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black so like matthew the idea good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond heaven forbid i should deny good points in him but he never had and he never will have any sense of the proprieties you know i was obliged said camilla i was obliged to be firm i said it will not do for the credit of the family i told him that without deep trimmings the family was disgraced i cried about it from breakfast till dinner i injured my digestion and at last he flung out in his violent way and said with a then do as you like thank goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things he paid for them did he not asked estella it s not the question my dear child who paid for them returned camilla i bought them and i shall often think of that with peace when i wake up in the night the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation and caused estella to say to me now boy on my turning round they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard sarah pocket say well i am sure what next and camilla add with indignation was there ever such a fancy the ie as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine well well miss i answered almost falling over her and checking myself she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her am i pretty yes i think you are very pretty am i insulting not so much so as you were last time said i not so much so no she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with such force as she had when i answered it now said she you little coarse monster what do you think of me now i shall not tell you because you are going to tell upstairs is that it no said i that s not it why don t you cry again you little wretch because i never cry for you again said i which was i suppose as false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for her then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards we went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going up we met a gentleman groping his way down whom have we here asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me a boy said estella he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand he took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn t lie down but stood up bristling his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious he had a large watchhain and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them he was nothing to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing him well boy of the neighbourhood hey said he yes sir said i how do you come here miss havisham sent for me sir i explained well behave yourself i have a pretty large experience of boys and you re a bad set of fellows now mind said he biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself with those words he released me which i was glad of for his hand smelt of scented soap and went his way downstairs i wondered whether he could be a doctor but no i thought he couldn t be a doctor or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner there was not much time to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havisham s room where she and everything else were just as i had left them estella left me standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressingable so she said without being startled or surprised the days have worn away have they yes ma am toay is there there there with the impatient movement of her fingers i don t want to know are you ready to play i was obliged to answer in some confusion i don t think i am ma am not at cards again she demanded with a searching look yes ma am i could do that if i was wanted since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to find for the other question and i said i was quite willing then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand and wait there till i come i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an airless smell that was oppressive a fire had been lately kindled in the damp oldashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air like our own marsh mist certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimneyiece faintly lighted the chamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness it was spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces the most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together an epergne or centreiece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and as i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black fungus i saw speckleegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same occurrence were important to their interests but the black beetles took no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way as if they were shortighted and hard of hearing and not on terms with one another these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder in her other hand she had a crutcheaded stick on which she leaned and she looked like the witch of the place this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i will be laid when i am dead they shall come and look at me here with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork at the fair i shrank under her touch what do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her stick that where those cobwebs are i can t guess what it is ma am it s a great cake a brideake mine she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come walk me walk me i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss havisham round and round the room accordingly i started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roo of mr pumblechook s chaiseart she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast after a while she said call estella so i went out on the landing and roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion when her light appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round and round the room if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didn t know what to do in my politeness i would have stopped but miss havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted on with a shameaced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket how well you look i do not returned miss havisham i am yellow skin and bone camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear soul certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing the idea and how are you said miss havisham to camilla as we were close to camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss havisham wouldn t stop we swept on and i felt that i was highly obnoxious to camilla thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be expected why what s the matter with you asked miss havisham with exceeding sharpness nothing worth mentioning replied camilla i don t wish to make a display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the night than i am quite equal to then don t think of me retorted miss havisham very easily said remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with anxiety of those i love if i could be less affectionate and sensitive i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves i am sure i wish it could be so but as to not thinking of you in the night the idea here a burst of tears the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and him i understood to be mr camilla he came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnuthells and a large mouth like a cat s without the whiskers supported this position by saying no indeed my dear hem thinking is easy enough said the grave lady what is easier you know assented miss sarah pocket oh yes yes cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom it s all very true it s a weakness to be so affectionate but i can t help it no doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still i wouldn t change my disposition if i could it s the cause of much suffering but it s a consolation to know i posses it when i wake up in the night here another burst of feeling miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber there s matthew said camilla never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how miss havisham is i have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my feet i don t know where much higher than your head my love said mr camilla i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of matthew s strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me really i must say i should think not interposed the grave lady you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious personag the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the pianoorte tuner s across the street where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance and now to be told here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and herself and stood looking at the speaker this change had a great influence in bringing camilla s chemistry to a sudden end matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly when i am laid on that table that will be his place there striking the table with her stick at my head and yours will be there and your husband s there and sarah pocket s there and georgiana s there now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me and now go at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in a new place she now said walk me walk me and we went on again i suppose there s nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply and depart it s something to have seen the object of one s love and duty for even so short a time i shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when i wake up in the night i wish matthew could have that comfort but he sets it at defiance i am determined not to make a display of my feelings but it s very hard to be told one wants to feast on one s relations as if one was a giant and to be told to go the bare idea mr camilla interposing as mrs camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth sarah pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last but sarah was too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence sarah pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnuthell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly at last she stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it some seconds this is my birthday pip i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick i don t suffer it to be spoken of i don t suffer those who were here just now or any one to speak of it they come here on the day but they dare not refer to it of course i made no further effort to refer to it on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it was brought here it and i have worn away together the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state to crumble under a touch when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when they lay me dead in my bride s dress on the bride s table which shall be done and which will be the finished curse upon him so much the better if it is done on this day she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there i remained quiet estella returned and she too remained quiet it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time in the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might presently begin to decay at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards why have you not begun with that we returned to her room and sat down as before i was beggared as before and again as before miss havisham watched us all the time directed my attention to estella s beauty and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estella s breast and hair estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she did not condescend to speak when we had played some halfozen games a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dogike manner there too i was again left to wander about as i liked it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last occasion open or shut enough that i saw no gate then and that i saw one now as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let the visitors out for she had returned with the keys in her hand i strolled into the garden and strolled all over it it was quite a wilderness and there were old melonrames and cucumberrames in it which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallenown grapeine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal corner upon which i had looked out of the window never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i now saw that he was inky halloa said he young fellow halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to be best answered by itself i said halloa politely omitting young fellow who let you in said he miss estella who gave you leave to prowl about miss estella come and fight said the pale young gentleman what could i do but follow him i have often asked myself the question since but what else could i do his manner was so final and i was so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a spell stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many paces i ought to give you a reason for fighting too there it is in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach the bullike proceeding last mentioned besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat i therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha would you and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience laws of the game said he here he skipped from his left leg on to his right regular rules here he skipped from his right leg on to his left come to the ground and go through the preliminaries here he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i looked helplessly at him i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention therefore i followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish on his asking me if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar available for both he said placing these against the wall and then fell to pulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once lightearted businessike and bloodthirsty although he did not look very healthy having pimples on his face and a breaking out at his mouth these dreadful preparations quite appalled me i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance for the rest he was a young gentleman in a grey suit when not denuded for battl with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone i never have been so surprised in my life as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly forehortened but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again the second greatest surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again looking up at me out of a black eye his spirit inspired me with great respect he seemed to have no strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out of the waterottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last he got heavily bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times not knowing where i was but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out that means you have won he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory indeed i go so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast however i got dressed darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same to you when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something had happened to delight her instead of going straight to the gate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me come here you may kiss me if you like i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me i think i would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek but i felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and that it was worth nothing what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black nightky and joe s furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman the more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me i felt that the pale young gentleman s blood was on my head and that the law would avenge it without having any definite idea of the penalties i had incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe punishment for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon me the pale young gentleman s nose had stained my trousers and i tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night i had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman s teeth and i twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before the judges when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence my terrors reached their height whether myrmidons of justice especially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the gate whether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those gravelothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me dead whether suborned boys a numerous band of mercenaries might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery and cuff me until i was no more it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features however go to miss havisham s i must and go i did and behold nothing came of the late struggle it was not alluded to in any way and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises i found the same gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within and all was lifeless only in the corner where the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young gentleman s existence there were traces of his gore in that spot and i covered them with gardenould from the eye of man on the broad landing between miss havisham s own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out i saw a gardenhair a light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind it had been placed there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulde round her own room and across the landing and round the other room over and over and over again we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch i insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was i going to be i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i believed and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my being ignorant neither did she ever give me any money or anything but my daily dinner nor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my services estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told me i might kiss her again sometimes she would coldly tolerate me sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she hated me miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip and when i said yes for indeed she would seem to enjoy it greedily also when we played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of estella s moods whatever they were and sometimes when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the burden was old clem this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation towards smiths it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clem s respected name thus you were to hammer boys round old clem with a thump and a sound old clem beat it out beat it out old clem with a clink for the stout old clem blow the fire blow the fire old clem roaring dryer soaring higher old clem one day soon after the appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the impatient movement of her fingers there there there sing i was surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor it happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep after that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind what could i become with these surroundings how could my character fail to be influenced by them is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which i had confessed under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of him besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time went on i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy but i told poor biddy everything why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though i think i know now meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit that ass pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to this hour with less penitence than i ought to fee that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaiseart they would have done it the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him as it were to operate upon and he would drag me up from my stool usually by the colla where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum here is this boy here is this boy which you brought up by hand hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do now mum with respections to this boy and then he would rumple my hair the wrong way which from my earliest remembrance as already hinted i have in my soul denied the right of any fellowreature to do and would hold me before him by the sleeve
