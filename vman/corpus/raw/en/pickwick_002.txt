did not know or did not understand anything that had been going forward under this impression he said with great firmness what do you want here sir supper s ready sir was the prompt reply have you just come here sir inquired mr tupman with a piercing look just replied the fat boy mr tupman looked at him very hard again but there was not a wink in his eye or a curve in his face mr tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt and walked towards the house the fat boy followed behind he knows nothing of what has happened he whispered nothing said the spinster aunt there was a sound behind them as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle mr tupman turned sharply round no it could not have been the fat boy there was not a gleam of mirth or anything but feeding in his whole visage he must have been fast asleep whispered mr tupman i have not the least doubt of it replied the spinster aunt they both laughed heartily mr tupman was wrong the fat boy for once had not been fast asleep he was awake ide awake o what had been going forward the supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation the old lady had gone to bed isabella wardle devoted herself exclusively to mr trundle the spinster s attentions were reserved for mr tupman and emily s thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object possibly they were with the absent snodgrass eleven welve ne o clock had struck and the gentlemen had not arrived consternation sat on every face could they have been waylaid and robbed should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which they could be supposed likely to have travelled home or should they ark there they were what could have made them so late a strange voice too to whom could it belong they rushed into the kitchen whither the truants had repaired and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the real state of the case mr pickwick with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely over his left eye was leaning against the dresser shaking his head from side to side and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause or pretence whatsoever old mr wardle with a highly inflamed countenance was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering protestations of eternal friendship mr winkle supporting himself by the eightay clock was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for the night and mr snodgrass had sunk into a chair with an expression of the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face is anything the matter inquired the three ladies nothing the matter replied mr pickwick we e re right say wardle we re all right ain t we i should think so replied the jolly host my dears here s my friend mr jingle r pickwick s friend mr jingle come pon ittle visit is anything the matter with mr snodgrass sir inquired emily with great anxiety nothing the matter ma am replied the stranger cricket dinner glorious party apital songs ld port laret ery good ine ma am ine it wasn t the wine murmured mr snodgrass in a broken voice it was the salmon somehow or other it never is the wine in these cases hadn t they better go to bed ma am inquired emma two of the boys will carry the gentlemen upstairs i won t go to bed said mr winkle firmly no living boy shall carry me said mr pickwick stoutly and he went on smiling as before hurrah gasped mr winkle faintly hurrah echoed mr pickwick taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen at this humorous feat he laughed outright let s ave nother ottle cried mr winkle commencing in a very loud key and ending in a very faint one his head dropped upon his breast and muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed and a sanguinary regret that he had not done for old tupman in the morning he fell fast asleep in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy to whose protecting care mr snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person mr pickwick accepted the proffered arm of mr tupman and quietly disappeared smiling more than ever and mr wardle after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution consigned to mr trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs and retired with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified what a shocking scene said the spinster aunt disusting ejaculated both the young ladies dreadful readful said jingle looking very grave he was about a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions horrid spectacle very what a nice man whispered the spinster aunt to mr tupman goodooking too whispered emily wardle oh decidedly observed the spinster aunt mr tupman thought of the widow at rochester and his mind was troubled the succeeding halfour s conversation was not of a nature to calm his perturbed spirit the new visitor was very talkative and the number of his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness mr tupman felt that as jingle s popularity increased he tupma retired further into the shade his laughter was forced is merriment feigned and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets he thought with horrid delight on the satisfaction it would afford him to have jingle s head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress the indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning and although his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the previous night exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity of the breakfastable so successful were his efforts that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt that he meaning jingl was an impudent young fellow a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided it was the old lady s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the arbour in which mr tupman had already signalised himself in form and manner following first the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old lady s bedroom door a close black satin bonnet a warm cotton shawl and a thick stick with a capacious handle and the old lady having put on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure would lean one hand on the stick and the other on the fat boy s shoulder and walk leisurely to the arbour where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half an hour at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her to the house the old lady was very precise and very particular and as this ceremony had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation from the accustomed form she was not a little surprised on this particular morning to see the fat boy instead of leaving the arbour walk a few paces out of it look carefully round him in every direction and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery the old lady was timorous ost old ladies are nd her first impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin she would have cried for assistance but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the power of screaming she therefore watched his motions with feelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished by his coming close up to her and shouting in her ear in an agitated and as it seemed to her a threatening tone missus now it so happened that mr jingle was walking in the garden close to the arbour at that moment he too heard the shouts of missus and stopped to hear more there were three reasons for his doing so in the first place he was idle and curious secondly he was by no means scrupulous thirdly and lastly he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs so there he stood and there he listened missus shouted the fat boy well joe said the trembling old lady i sure i have been a good mistress to you joe you have invariably been treated very kindly you have never had too much to do and you have always had enough to eat this last was an appeal to the fat boy s most sensitive feelings he seemed touched as he replied emphatically i knows i has then what can you want to do now said the old lady gaining courage i wants to make your flesh creep replied the boy this sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one s gratitude and as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such a result was to be attained all her former horrors returned what do you think i see in this very arbour last night inquired the boy bless us what exclaimed the old lady alarmed at the solemn manner of the corpulent youth the strange gentleman im as had his arm hurt issin and huggin who joe none of the servants i hope worser than that roared the fat boy in the old lady s ear not one of my grandda aters worser than that worse than that joe said the old lady who had thought this the extreme limit of human atrocity who was it joe i insist upon knowing the fat boy looked cautiously round and having concluded his survey shouted in the old lady s ear miss rachael what said the old lady in a shrill tone speak louder miss rachael roared the fat boy my da ater the train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent communicated a blancange like motion to his fat cheeks and she suffered him exclaimed the old lady a grin stole over the fat boy s features as he said i see her aissin of him agin if mr jingle from his place of concealment could have beheld the expression which the old lady s face assumed at this communication the probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his close vicinity to the summerouse he listened attentively fragments of angry sentences such as without my permission at her time of life miserable old like me might have waited till i was dead and so forth reached his ears and then he heard the heels of the fat boy s boots crunching the gravel as he retired and left the old lady alone it was a remarkable coincidence perhaps but it was nevertheless a fact that mr jingle within five minutes of his arrival at manor farm on the preceding night had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the spinster aunt without delay he had observation enough to see that his offand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his attack and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that most desirable of all requisites a small independence the imperative necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other flashed quickly upon him and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending to that end and object without a moment s delay fielding tells us that man is fire and woman tow and the prince of darkness sets a light to em mr jingle knew that young men to spinster aunts are as lighted gas to gunpowder and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion without loss of time full of reflections upon this important decision he crept from his place of concealment and under cover of the shrubs before mentioned approached the house fortune seemed determined to favour his design mr tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just as he obtained a view of it and the young ladies he knew had walked out alone soon after breakfast the coast was clear the breakfastarlour door was partially open he peeped in the spinster aunt was knitting he coughed she looked up and smiled hesitation formed no part of mr alfred jingle s character he laid his finger on his lips mysteriously walked in and closed the door miss wardle said mr jingle with affected earnestness forgive intrusion hort acquaintance o time for ceremony discovered sir said the spinster aunt rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of mr jingle s sanity hush said mr jingle in a stagehisper large boy umpling face round eyes ascal here he shook his head expressively and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation i presume you allude to joseph sir said the lady making an effort to appear composed yes ma am amn that joe reacherous dog joe old the old lady old lady furious ild aving rbour upman issing and hugging that sort of thing h ma am h mr jingle said the spinster aunt if you come here sir to insult me not at all y no means replied the unabashed mr jingle overheard the tale ame to warn you of your danger ender my services revent the hubbub never mind hink it an insult eave the room nd he turned as if to carry the threat into execution what shall i do said the poor spinster bursting into tears my brother will be furious of course he will said mr jingle pausing outrageous oh mr jingle what can i say exclaimed the spinster aunt in another flood of despair say he dreamt it replied mr jingle coolly a ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this suggestion mr jingle perceived it and followed up his advantage pooh pooh othing more easy lackguard boy ovely woman at boy horsewhipped ou believed nd of the matter comfortable whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill timed discovery was delightful to the spinster s feelings or whether the hearing herself described as a lovely woman softened the asperity of her grief we know not she blushed slightly and cast a grateful look on mr jingle that insinuating gentleman sighed deeply fixed his eyes on the spinster aunt s face for a couple of minutes started melodramatically and suddenly withdrew them you seem unhappy mr jingle said the lady in a plaintive voice may i show my gratitude for your kind interference by inquiring into the cause with a view if possible to its removal ha exclaimed mr jingle with another start removal remove my unhappiness and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the blessing ho even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the niece of the creature who ut no he is my friend i will not expose his vices miss wardle arewell at the conclusion of this address the most consecutive he was ever known to utter mr jingle applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed and turned towards the door stay mr jingle said the spinster aunt emphatically you have made an allusion to mr tupman xplain it never exclaimed jingle with a professional i e theatrica air never and by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down mr jingle said the aunt i entreat implore you if there is any dreadful mystery connected with mr tupman reveal it can i said mr jingle fixing his eyes on the aunt s face can i see ovely creature acrificed at the shrine eartless avarice he appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few seconds and then said in a low voice tupman only wants your money the wretch exclaimed the spinster with energetic indignation mr jingle s doubts were resolved she had money more than that said jingle loves another another ejaculated the spinster who short girl lack eyes iece emily there was a pause now if there was one individual in the whole world of whom the spinster aunt entertained a mortal and deepooted jealousy it was this identical niece the colour rushed over her face and neck and she tossed her head in silence with an air of ineffable contempt at last biting her thin lips and bridling up she said it can t be i won t believe it watch em said jingle i will said the aunt watch his looks i will his whispers i will he sit next her at table let him he flatter her let him he pay her every possible attention let him and he cut you cut me screamed the spinster aunt he cut me will he and she trembled with rage and disappointment you will convince yourself said jingle i will you show your spirit i will you not have him afterwards never you take somebody else yes you shall mr jingle fell on his knees remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt conditionally upon mr tupman s perjury being made clear and manifest the burden of proof lay with mr alfred jingle and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner the spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes mr tracy tupman was established at emily s side ogling whispering and smiling in opposition to mr snodgrass not a word not a look not a glance did he bestow upon his heart s pride of the evening before damn that boy thought old mr wardle to himself e had heard the story from his mother damn that boy he must have been asleep it s all imagination traitor thought the spinster aunt dear mr jingle was not deceiving me ugh how i hate the wretch the following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of mr tracy tupman the time was evening the scene the garden there were two figures walking in a side path one was rather short and stout the other tall and slim they were mr tupman and mr jingle the stout figure commenced the dialogue how did i do it he inquired splendid apital ouldn t act better myself ou must repeat the part toorrow very evening till further notice does rachael still wish it of course he don t like it ut must be done vert suspicion fraid of her brother ays there s no help for it nly a few days more hen old folks blinded rown your happiness any message love est love indest regards nalterable affection can i say anything for you my dear fellow replied the unsuspicious mr tupman fervently grasping his friend s hand carry my best love ay how hard i find it to dissemble ay anything that s kind but add how sensible i am of the necessity of the suggestion she made to me through you this morning say i applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion i will anything more nothing only add how ardently i long for the time when i may call her mine and all dissimulation may be unnecessary certainly certainly anything more oh my friend said poor mr tupman again grasping the hand of his companion receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness and forgive me if i have ever even in thought done you the injustice of supposing that you could stand in my way my dear friend can i ever repay you don t talk of it replied mr jingle he stopped short as if suddenly recollecting something and said by the bye an t spare ten pounds can you ery particular purpose ay you in three days i dare say i can replied mr tupman in the fulness of his heart three days you say only three days over then o more difficulties mr tupman counted the money into his companion s hand and he dropped it piece by piece into his pocket as they walked towards the house be careful said mr jingle not a look not a wink said mr tupman not a syllable not a whisper all your attentions to the niece ather rude than otherwise to the aunt nly way of deceiving the old ones i take care said mr tupman aloud and i take care said mr jingle internally and they entered the house the scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening and on the three afternoons and evenings next ensuing on the fourth the host was in high spirits for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against mr tupman so was mr tupman for mr jingle had told him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis so was mr pickwick for he was seldom otherwise so was not mr snodgrass for he had grown jealous of mr tupman so was the old lady for she had been winning at whist so were mr jingle and miss wardle for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter chapter a discovery and a chase the supper was ready laid the chairs were drawn round the table bottles jugs and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole fourndwenty hours where s rachael said mr wardle ay and jingle added mr pickwick dear me said the host i wonder i haven t missed him before why i don t think i ve heard his voice for two hours at least emily my dear ring the bell the bell was rung and the fat boy appeared where s miss rachael he couldn t say where s mr jingle then he didn t know everybody looked surprised it was late ast eleven o clock mr tupman laughed in his sleeve they were loitering somewhere talking about him ha ha capital notion that unny never mind said wardle after a short pause they turn up presently i dare say i never wait supper for anybody excellent rule that said mr pickwick admirable pray sit down said the host certainly said mr pickwick and down they sat there was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table and mr pickwick was supplied with a plentiful portion of it he had raised his fork to his lips and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen he paused and laid down his fork mr wardle paused too and insensibly released his hold of the carvingnife which remained inserted in the beef he looked at mr pickwick mr pickwick looked at him heavy footsteps were heard in the passage the parlour door was suddenly burst open and the man who had cleaned mr pickwick s boots on his first arrival rushed into the room followed by the fat boy and all the domestics what the devil s the meaning of this exclaimed the host the kitchen chimney ain t aire is it emma inquired the old lady lor grandma no screamed both the young ladies what s the matter roared the master of the house the man gasped for breath and faintly ejaculated they ha gone mas r one right clean off sir at this juncture mr tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork and to turn very pale who s gone said mr wardle fiercely mus r jingle and miss rachael in a po hay from blue lion muggleton i was there but i couldn t stop em so i run off to tell i paid his expenses said mr tupman jumping up frantically he s got ten pounds of mine top him e s swindled me won t bear it have justice pickwick won t stand it and with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature the unhappy gentleman spun round and round the apartment in a transport of frenzy lord preserve us ejaculated mr pickwick eyeing the extraordinary gestures of his friend with terrified surprise he s gone mad what shall we do do said the stout old host who regarded only the last words of the sentence put the horse in the gig i get a chaise at the lion and follow em instantly where e exclaimed as the man ran out to execute the commission where s that villain joe here i am but i hain t a willin replied a voice it was the fat boy s let me get at him pickwick cried wardle as he rushed at the ill starred youth he was bribed by that scoundrel jingle to put me on a wrong scent by telling a cockndull story of my sister and your friend tupman here mr tupman sank into a chair let me get at him don t let him screamed all the women above whose exclamations the blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible i won t be held cried the old man mr winkle take your hands off mr pickwick let me go sir it was a beautiful sight in that moment of turmoil and confusion to behold the placid and philosophical expression of mr pickwick s face albeit somewhat flushed with exertion as he stood with his arms firmly clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host thus restraining the impetuosity of his passion while the fat boy was scratched and pulled and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein he had no sooner released his hold than the man entered to announce that the gig was ready don t let him go alone screamed the females he kill somebody i go with him said mr pickwick you re a good fellow pickwick said the host grasping his hand emma give mr pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck ake haste look after your grandmother girls she has fainted away now then are you ready mr pickwick s mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large shawl his hat having been put on his head and his greatcoat thrown over his arm he replied in the affirmative they jumped into the gig give her her head tom cried the host and away they went down the narrow lanes jolting in and out of the cart ruts and bumping up against the hedges on either side as if they would go to pieces every moment how much are they ahead shouted wardle as they drove up to the door of the blue lion round which a little crowd had collected late as it was not above threeuarters of an hour was everybody s reply chaisendour directly ut with em put up the gig afterwards now boys cried the landlord chaisendour out ake haste alive there away ran the hostlers and the boys the lanterns glimmered as the men ran to and fro the horses hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coachouse and all was noise and bustle now then s that chaise coming out toight cried wardle coming down the yard now sir replied the hostler out came the chaise n went the horses n sprang the boys n got the travellers mind he sevenile stage in less than half an hour shouted wardle off with you the boys applied whip and spur the waiters shouted the hostlers cheered and away they went fast and furiously pretty situation thought mr pickwick when he had had a moment s time for reflection pretty situation for the general chairman of the pickwick club damp chaise trange horses ifteen miles an hour nd twelve o clock at night for the first three or four miles not a word was spoken by either of the gentlemen each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address any observations to his companion when they had gone over that much ground however and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work in really good style mr pickwick became too much exhilarated with the rapidity of the motion to remain any longer perfectly mute we re sure to catch them i think said he hope so replied his companion fine night said mr pickwick looking up at the moon which was shining brightly so much the worse returned wardle for they have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us and we shall lose it it will have gone down in another hour it will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark won t it inquired mr pickwick i dare say it will replied his friend dryly mr pickwick s temporary excitement began to sober down a little as he reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which he had so thoughtlessly embarked he was roused by a loud shouting of the postoy on the leader yoooooe went the first boy yooooe went the second yooooe chimed in old wardle himself most lustily with his head and half his body out of the coach window yooooe shouted mr pickwick taking up the burden of the cry though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object and amidst the yooing of the whole four the chaise stopped what s the matter inquired mr pickwick there s a gate here replied old wardle we shall hear something of the fugitives after a lapse of five minutes consumed in incessant knocking and shouting an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpikeouse and opened the gate how long is it since a posthaise went through here inquired mr wardle how long ah why i don t rightly know it worn t a long time ago nor it worn t a short time ago ust between the two perhaps has any chaise been by at all oh yes there s been a chay by how long ago my friend interposed mr pickwick an hour ah i dare say it might be replied the man or two hours inquired the post oy on the wheeler well i shouldn t wonder if it was returned the old man doubtfully drive on boys cried the testy old gentleman don t waste any more time with that old idiot idiot exclaimed the old man with a grin as he stood in the middle of the road with the gate halflosed watching the chaise which rapidly diminished in the increasing distance no ot much o that either you ve lost ten minutes here and gone away as wise as you came arter all if every man on the line as has a guinea give him earns it half as well you won t catch t other chay this side mich lmas old shortnd fat and with another prolonged grin the old man closed the gate re entered his house and bolted the door after him meanwhile the chaise proceeded without any slackening of pace towards the conclusion of the stage the moon as wardle had foretold was rapidly on the wane large tiers of dark heavy clouds which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past now formed one black mass overhead and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night the wind too which was directly against them swept in furious gusts down the narrow road and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway mr pickwick drew his coat closer about him coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise and fell into a sound sleep from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle the sound of the hostler s bell and a loud cry of horses on directly but here another delay occurred the boys were sleeping with such mysterious soundness that it took five minutes aiece to wake them the hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable and even when that was found two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh had mr pickwick been alone these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once but old wardle was not to be so easily daunted and he laid about him with such hearty goodill cuffing this man and pushing that strapping a buckle here and taking in a link there that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably have been expected under so many difficulties they resumed their journey and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging the stage was fifteen miles long the night was dark the wind high and the rain pouring in torrents it was impossible to make any great way against such obstacles united it was hard upon one o clock already and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end of the stage here however an object presented itself which rekindled their hopes and reanimated their drooping spirits when did this chaise come in cried old wardle leaping out of his own vehicle and pointing to one covered with wet mud which was standing in the yard not a quarter of an hour ago sir replied the hostler to whom the question was addressed lady and gentleman inquired wardle almost breathless with impatience yes sir tall gentleman ressoat ong legs hin body yes sir elderly lady hin face ather skinny h yes sir by heavens it s the couple pickwick exclaimed the old gentleman would have been here before said the hostler but they broke a trace tis them said wardle it is by jove chaisendour instantly we shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage a guinea aiece boyse alive there ustle about here s good fellows and with such admonitions as these the old gentleman ran up and down the yard and bustled to and fro in a state of excitement which communicated itself to mr pickwick also and under the influence of which that gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with harness and mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises in the most surprising manner firmly believing that by so doing he was materially forwarding the preparations for their resuming their journey jump in ump in cried old wardle climbing into the chaise pulling up the steps and slamming the door after him come along make haste and before mr pickwick knew precisely what he was about he felt himself forced in at the other door by one pull from the old gentleman and one push from the hostler and off they were again ah we are moving now said the old gentleman exultingly they were indeed as was sufficiently testified to mr pickwick by his constant collision either with the hard woodork of the chaise or the body of his companion hold up said the stout old mr wardle as mr pickwick dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat i never did feel such a jolting in my life said mr pickwick never mind replied his companion it will soon be over steady steady mr pickwick planted himself into his own corner as firmly as he could and on whirled the chaise faster than ever they had travelled in this way about three miles when mr wardle who had been looking out of the window for two or three minutes suddenly drew in his face covered with splashes and exclaimed in breathless eagerness here they are mr pickwick thrust his head out of his window yes there was a chaise andour a short distance before them dashing along at full gallop go on go on almost shrieked the old gentleman two guineas aiece boys on t let em gain on us it up it up the horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed and those in mr wardle s galloped furiously behind them i see his head exclaimed the choleric old man damme i see his head so do i said mr pickwick that s he mr pickwick was not mistaken the countenance of mr jingle completely coated with mud thrown up by the wheels was plainly discernible at the window of his chaise and the motion of his arm which was waving violently towards the postillions denoted that he was encouraging them to increased exertion the interest was intense fields trees and hedges seemed to rush past them with the velocity of a whirlwind so rapid was the pace at which they tore along they were close by the side of the first chaise jingle s voice could be plainly heard even above the din of the wheels urging on the boys old mr wardle foamed with rage and excitement he roared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen clenched his fist and shook it expressively at the object of his indignation but mr jingle only answered with a contemptuous smile and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph as his horses answering the increased application of whip and spur broke into a faster gallop and left the pursuers behind mr pickwick had just drawn in his head and mr wardle exhausted with shouting had done the same when a tremendous jolt threw them forward against the front of the vehicle there was a sudden bump loud crash way rolled a wheel and over went the chaise after a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion in which nothing but the plunging of horses and breaking of glass could be made out mr pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the chaise and as soon as he had gained his feet extricated his head from the skirts of his greatcoat which materially impeded the usefulness of his spectacles the full disaster of the case met his view old mr wardle without a hat and his clothes torn in several places stood by his side and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet the postoys who had succeeded in cutting the traces were standing disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding by the horses heads about a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise which had pulled up on hearing the crash the postillions each with a broad grin convulsing his countenance were viewing the adverse party from their saddles and mr jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach window with evident satisfaction the day was just breaking and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning hollo shouted the shameless jingle anybody damaged lderly gentlemen o light weights angerous work ery you re a rascal roared wardle ha ha replied jingle and then he added with a knowing wink and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise i say he s very well esires her compliments egs you won t trouble yourself ove to tuppy on t you get up behind rive on boys the postillions resumed their proper attitudes and away rattled the chaise mr jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the coach window nothing in the whole adventure not even the upset had disturbed the calm and equable current of mr pickwick s temper the villainy however which could first borrow money of his faithful follower and then abbreviate his name to tuppy was more than he could patiently bear he drew his breath hard and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles as he said slowly and emphatically if ever i meet that man again i yes yes interrupted wardle that s all very well but while we stand talking here they get their licence and be married in london mr pickwick paused bottled up his vengeance and corked it down how far is it to the next stage inquired mr wardle of one of the boys six mile ain t it tom rayther better rayther better nor six mile sir can t be helped said wardle we must walk it pickwick no help for it replied that truly great man so sending forward one of the boys on horseback to procure a fresh chaise and horses and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken one mr pickwick and mr wardle set manfully forward on the walk first tying their shawls round their necks and slouching down their hats to escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain which after a slight cessation had again begun to pour heavily down chapter clearing up all doubts if any existe of the disinterestedness of mr a jingle s character there are in london several old inns once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking places of country wagons the reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries among the golden crosses and bull and mouths which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of london if he would light upon any of these old places he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town and there in some secluded nooks he will find several still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness amidst the modern innovations which surround them in the borough especially there still remain some halfozen old inns which have preserved their external features unchanged and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation great rambling queer old places they are with galleries and passages and staircases wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old london bridge and its adjacent neighbourhood on the surrey side it was in the yard of one of these inns f no less celebrated a one than the white hart hat a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots early on the morning succeeding the events narrated in the last chapter he was habited in a coarse striped waistcoat with black calico sleeves and blue glass buttons drab breeches and leggings a bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and unstudied style round his neck and an old white hat was carelessly thrown on one side of his head there were two rows of boots before him one cleaned and the other dirty and at every addition he made to the clean row he paused from his work and contemplated its results with evident satisfaction the yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn three or four lumbering wagons each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy about the height of the secondloor window of an ordinary house were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard and another which was probably to commence its journey that morning was drawn out into the open space a double tier of bedroom galleries with old clumsy balustrades ran round two sides of the straggling area and a double row of bells to correspond sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof hung over the door leading to the bar and coffeeoom two or three gigs and chaisearts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pentouses and the occasional heavy tread of a cartorse or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard announced to anybody who cared about the matter that the stable lay in that direction when we add that a few boys in smockrocks were lying asleep on heavy packages woolacks and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the white hart inn high street borough on the particular morning in question a loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery who after tapping at one of the doors and receiving a request from within called over the balustrades sam hollo replied the man with the white hat number twentywo wants his boots ask number twentywo vether he have em now or vait till he gets em was the reply come don t be a fool sam said the girl coaxingly the gentleman wants his boots directly well you are a nice young for a musical party you are said the bootleaner look at these here

increased assiduity there was another loud ring and the bustling old landlady of the white hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery sam cried the landlady where s that lazy idle hy sam h there you are why don t you answer vouldn t be geneel to answer till you done talking replied sam gruffly here clean these shoes for number seventeen directly and take em to private sittingoom number five first floor the landlady flung a pair of lady s shoes into the yard and bustled away number five said sam as he picked up the shoes and taking a piece of chalk from his pocket made a memorandum of their destination on the soles lady s shoes and private sittin i suppose she didn t come in the vagin she came in early this morning cried the girl who was still leaning over the railing of the gallery with a gentleman in a hackneyoach and it s him as wants his boots and you better do em that s all about it vy didn t you say so before said sam with great indignation singling out the boots in question from the heap before him for all i know he was one o the regular threepennies private room and a lady too if he s anything of a gen n he s vurth a shillin a day let alone the arrands stimulated by this inspiring reflection mr samuel brushed away with such hearty goodill that in a few minutes the boots and shoes with a polish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable mr warren for they used day martin at the white har had arrived at the door of number five come in said a man s voice in reply to sam s rap at the door sam made his best bow and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast having officiously deposited the gentleman s boots right and left at his feet and the lady s shoes right and left at hers he backed towards the door boots said the gentleman sir said sam closing the door and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock do you know hat s octors commons yes sir where is it paul s churchyard sir low archway on the

away from you ruel charmer and mr jingle skipped playfully up to the spinster aunt imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips and danced out of the room dear man said the spinster as the door closed after him rum old girl said mr jingle as he walked down the passage it is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species and we will not therefore pursue the thread of mr jingle s meditations as he wended his way to doctors commons it will be sufficient for our purpose to relate that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons who guard the entrance to that enchanted region he reached the vicareneral s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment from the archbishop of canterbury to his trusty and welleloved alfred jingle and rachael wardle greeting he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket and retraced his steps in triumph to the borough he was yet on his way to the white hart when two plump gentleman and one thin one entered the yard and looked round in search of some authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries mr samuel weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter after the fatigues of the borough market and to him the thin gentleman straightway advanced my friend said the thin gentleman you re one o the adwice gratis order thought sam or you wouldn t be so wery fond o me all at once but he only said well sir my friend said the thin gentleman with a conciliatory hem have you got many people stopping here now pretty busy eh sam stole a look at the inquirer he was a little highried man with a dark squeezedp face and small restless black eyes that kept winking and twinkling on each side of his little inquisitive nose as if they were playing a perpetual game of peepo with that feature he was dressed all in black with boots as shiny as his eyes a low white neckcloth and a clean shirt with a frill to it a gold watchhain and seals depended from his fob he carried his black kid gloves in his hands and not on them and as he spoke thrust his wrists beneath his coat tails with the air of a man who was in the habit of propounding some regular posers pretty busy eh said the little man oh wery well sir replied sam we shan t be bankrupts and we shan t make our fort ns we eats our biled mutton without capers and don t care for horseadish ven ve can get beef ah said the little man you re a wag ain t you my eldest brother was troubled with that complaint said sam it may be catching used to sleep with him this is a curious old house of yours said the little man looking round him if you sent word you was aoming we ha had it repaired replied the imperturbable sam the little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen at its conclusion the little man took a pinch of snuff from an oblong silver box and was apparently on the point of renewing the conversation when one of the plump gentlemen who in addition to a benevolent countenance possessed a pair of spectacles and a pair of black gaiters interfered the fact of the matter is said the benevolent gentleman that my friend here pointing to the other plump gentlema will give you half a guinea if you answer one or two now my dear sir y dear sir said the little man pray allow me my dear sir the very first principle to be observed in these cases is this if you place the matter in the hands of a professional man you must in no way interfere in the progress of the business you must repose implicit confidence in him really mr he turned to the other plump gentleman and said i forget your friend s name pickwick said mr wardle for it was no other than that jolly personage ah pickwick eally mr pickwick my dear sir excuse me shall be happy to receive any private suggestions of yours as amicus curiae but you must see the impropriety of your interfering with my conduct in this case with such an ad captandum argument as the offer of half a guinea really my dear sir really and the little man took an argumentative pinch of snuff and looked very profound my only wish sir said mr pickwick was to bring this very unpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible quite right uite right said the little man with which view continued mr pickwick i made use of the argument which my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed in any case ay ay said the little man very good very good indeed but you should have suggested it to me my dear sir i quite certain you cannot be ignorant of the extent of confidence which must be placed in professional men if any authority can be necessary on such a point my dear sir let me refer you to the wellnown case in barnwell and never mind george barnwell interrupted sam who had remained a wondering listener during this short colloquy everybody knows what sort of a case his was tho it s always been my opinion mind you that the young deserved scragging a precious sight more than he did hows ever that s neither here nor there you want me to accept of half a guinea wery well i agreeable i can t say no fairer than that can i sir mr pickwick smiled then the next question is what the devil do you want with me as the man said wen he see the ghost we want to know said mr wardle now my dear sir y dear sir interposed the busy little man mr wardle shrugged his shoulders and was silent we want to know said the little man solemnly and we ask the question of you in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside we want to know who you ve got in this house at present who there is in the house said sam in whose mind the inmates were always represented by that particular article of their costume which came under his immediate superintendence there s a vooden leg in number six there s a pair of hessians in thirteen there s two pair of halves in the commercial there s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar and five more tops in the coffeeoom nothing more said the little man stop a bit replied sam suddenly recollecting himself yes there s a pair of vellingtons a good deal worn and a pair o lady s shoes in number five what sort of shoes hastily inquired wardle who together with mr pickwick had been lost in bewilderment at the singular catalogue of visitors country make replied sam any maker s name brown where of muggleton it is them exclaimed wardle by heavens we ve found them hush said sam the vellingtons has gone to doctors commons no said the little man yes for a licence we re in time exclaimed wardle show us the room not a moment is to be lost pray my dear sir ray said the little man caution caution he drew from his pocket a red silk purse and looked very hard at sam as he drew out a sovereign sam grinned expressively show us into the room at once without announcing us said the little man and it s yours sam threw the painted tops into a corner and led the way through a dark passage and up a wide staircase he paused at the end of a second passage and held out his hand here it is whispered the attorney as he deposited the money on the hand of their guide the man stepped forward for a few paces followed by the two friends and their legal adviser he stopped at a door is this the room murmured the little gentleman sam nodded assent old wardle opened the door and the whole three walked into the room just as mr jingle who had that moment returned had produced the licence to the spinster aunt the spinster uttered a loud shriek and throwing herself into a chair covered her face with her hands mr jingle crumpled up the licence and thrust it into his coat pocket the unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room you ou are a nice rascal arn t you exclaimed wardle breathless with passion my dear sir my dear sir said the little man laying his hat on the table pray consider ray defamation of character action for damages calm yourself my dear sir pray how dare you drag my sister from my house said the old man ay y ery good said the little gentleman you may ask that how dare you sir h sir who the devil are you inquired mr jingle in so fierce a tone that the little gentleman involuntarily fell back a step or two who is he you scoundrel interposed wardle he s my lawyer mr perker of gray s inn perker i have this fellow prosecuted indicted ruin him and you continued mr wardle turning abruptly round to his sister you rachael at a time of life when you ought to know better what do you mean by running away with a vagabond disgracing your family and making yourself miserable get on your bonnet and come back call a hackneyoach there directly and bring this lady s bill ye hear ye hear cert nly sir replied sam who had answered wardle s violent ringing of the bell with a degree of celerity which must have appeared marvellous to anybody who didn t know that his eye had been applied to the outside of the keyhole during the whole interview get on your bonnet repeated wardle do nothing of the kind said jingle leave the room sir o business here ady s free to act as she pleases ore than onendwenty more than onendwenty ejaculated wardle contemptuously more than onendorty i ain t said the spinster aunt her indignation getting the better of her determination to faint you are replied wardle you re fifty if you re an hour here the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek and became senseless a glass of water said the humane mr pickwick summoning the landlady a glass of water said the passionate wardle bring a bucket and throw it all over her it do her good and she richly deserves it ugh you brute ejaculated the kindearted landlady poor dear and with sundry ejaculations of come now there s a dear rink a little of this t do you good on t give way so here s a love etc etc the landlady assisted by a chambermaid proceeded to vinegar the forehead beat the hands titillate the nose and unlace the stays of the spinster aunt and to administer such other restoratives as are usually applied by compassionate females to ladies who are endeavouring to ferment themselves into hysterics coach is ready sir said sam appearing at the door come along cried wardle i carry her downstairs at this proposition the hysterics came on with redoubled violence the landlady was about to enter a very violent protest against this proceeding and had already given vent to an indignant inquiry whether mr wardle considered himself a lord of the creation when mr jingle interposed boots said he get me an officer stay stay said little mr perker consider sir consider i not consider replied jingle she s her own mistress who dares to take her away nless she wishes it i won t be taken away murmured the spinster aunt i don t wish it here there was a frightful relapse my dear sir said the little man in a low tone taking mr wardle and mr pickwick apart my dear sir we re in a very awkward situation it s a distressing case ery i never knew one more so but really my dear sir really we have no power to control this lady s actions i warned you before we came my dear sir that there was nothing to look to but a compromise there was a short pause what kind of compromise would you recommend inquired mr pickwick why my dear sir our friend s in an unpleasant position ery much so we must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss i suffer any rather than submit to this disgrace and let her fool as she is be made miserable for life said wardle i rather think it can be done said the bustling little man mr jingle will you step with us into the next room for a moment mr jingle assented and the quartette walked into an empty apartment now sir said the little man as he carefully closed the door is there no way of accommodating this matter tep this way sir for a moment nto this window sir where we can be alone here sir there pray sit down sir now my dear sir between you and i we know very well my dear sir that you have run off with this lady for the sake of her money don t frown sir don t frown i say between you and i we know it we are both men of the world and we know very well that our friends here are not h mr jingle s face gradually relaxed and something distantly resembling a wink quivered for an instant in his left eye very good very good said the little man observing the impression he had made now the fact is that beyond a few hundreds the lady has little or nothing till the death of her mother ine old lady my dear sir old said mr jingle briefly but emphatically why yes said the attorney with a slight cough you are right my dear sir she is rather old she comes of an old family though my dear sir old in every sense of the word the founder of that family came into kent when julius caesar invaded britain nly one member of it since who hasn t lived to eightyive and he was beheaded by one of the henrys the old lady is not seventyhree now my dear sir the little man paused and took a pinch of snuff well cried mr jingle well my dear sir ou don t take snuff h so much the better expensive habit ell my dear sir you re a fine young man man of the world ble to push your fortune if you had capital eh well said mr jingle again do you comprehend me not quite don t you think ow my dear sir i put it to you don t you think that fifty pounds and liberty would be better than miss wardle and expectation won t do ot half enough said mr jingle rising nay nay my dear sir remonstrated the little attorney seizing him by the button good round sum man like you could treble it in no time reat deal to be done with fifty pounds my dear sir more to be done with a hundred and fifty replied mr jingle coolly well my dear sir we won t waste time in splitting straws resumed the little man say ay eventy won t do said mr jingle don t go away my dear sir ray don t hurry said the little man eighty come i write you a cheque at once won t do said mr jingle well my dear sir well said the little man still detaining him just tell me what will do expensive affair said mr jingle money out of pocket osting nine pounds licence three hat s twelve ompensation a hundred undred and twelve reach of honour nd loss of the lady yes my dear sir yes said the little man with a knowing look never mind the last two items that s a hundred and twelve ay a hundred ome and twenty said mr jingle come come i write you a cheque said the little man and down he sat at the table for that purpose i make it payable the day after toorrow said the little man with a look towards mr wardle and we can get the lady away meanwhile mr wardle sullenly nodded assent a hundred said the little man and twenty said mr jingle my dear sir remonstrated the little man give it him interposed mr wardle and let him go the cheque was written by the little gentleman and pocketed by mr jingle now leave this house instantly said wardle starting up my dear sir urged the little man and mind said mr wardle that nothing should have induced me to make this compromise ot even a regard for my family f i had not known that the moment you got any money in that pocket of yours you go to the devil faster if possible than you would without it my dear sir urged the little man again be quiet perker resumed wardle leave the room sir off directly said the unabashed jingle bye bye pickwick if any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the illustrious man whose name forms the leading feature of the title of this work during the latter part of this conversation he would have been almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from his eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles o majestic was his wrath his nostrils dilated and his fists clenched involuntarily as he heard himself addressed by the villain but he restrained himself again e did not pulverise him here continued the hardened traitor tossing the licence at mr pickwick s feet get the name altered ake home the lady o for tuppy mr pickwick was a philosopher but philosophers are only men in armour after all the shaft had reached him penetrated through his philosophical harness to his very heart in the frenzy of his rage he hurled the inkstand madly forward and followed it up himself but mr jingle had disappeared and he found himself caught in the arms of sam hollo said that eccentric functionary furniter s cheap where you come from sir selfcting ink that ere it s wrote your mark upon the wall old gen n hold still sir wot s the use o runnin arter a man as has made his lucky and got to t other end of the borough by this time mr pickwick s mind like those of all truly great men was open to conviction he was a quick and powerful reasoner and a moment s reflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage it subsided as quickly as it had been roused he panted for breath and looked benignantly round upon his friends shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when miss wardle found herself deserted by the faithless jingle shall we extract mr pickwick s masterly description of that heartrending scene his note book blotted with the tears of sympathising humanity lies open before us one word and it is in the printer s hands but no we will be resolute we will not wring the public bosom with the delineation of such suffering slowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next day in the muggleton heavy coach dimly and darkly had the sombre shadows of a summer s night fallen upon all around when they again reached dingley dell and stood within the entrance to manor farm chapter involving another journey and an antiquarian discovery recording mr pickwick s determination to be present at an election and containing a manuscript of the old clergyman s a night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of dingley dell and an hour s breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning completely recovered mr pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and anxiety of mind that illustrious man had been separated from his friends and followers for two whole days and it was with a degree of pleasure and delight which no common imagination can adequately conceive that he stepped forward to greet mr winkle and mr snodgrass as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his early walk the pleasure was mutual for who could ever gaze on mr pickwick s beaming face without experiencing the sensation but still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of and was wholly at a loss to account for there was a mysterious air about them both as unusual as it was alarming and how said mr pickwick when he had grasped his followers by the hand and exchanged warm salutations of welcome how is tupman mr winkle to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed made no reply he turned away his head and appeared absorbed in melancholy reflection snodgrass said mr pickwick earnestly how is our friend e is not ill no replied mr snodgrass and a tear trembled on his sentimental eyelid like a rainrop on a windowrame no he is not ill mr pickwick stopped and gazed on each of his friends in turn winkle nodgrass said mr pickwick what does this mean where is our friend what has happened speak conjure i entreat ay i command you speak there was a solemnity dignity n mr pickwick s manner not to be withstood he is gone said mr snodgrass gone exclaimed mr pickwick gone gone repeated mr snodgrass where ejaculated mr pickwick we can only guess from that communication replied mr snodgrass taking a letter from his pocket and placing it in his friend s hand yesterday morning when a letter was received from mr wardle stating that you would be home with his sister at night the melancholy which had hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day was observed to increase he shortly afterwards disappeared he was missing during the whole day and in the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from the crown at muggleton it had been left in his charge in the morning with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night mr pickwick opened the epistle it was in his friend s handriting and these were its contents my dear pickwick you my dear friend are placed far beyond the reach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people cannot overcome you do not know what it is at one blow to be deserted by a lovely and fascinating creature and to fall a victim to the artifices of a villain who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of friendship i hope you never may any letter addressed to me at the leather bottle cobham kent will be forwarded upposing i still exist i hasten from the sight of that world which has become odious to me should i hasten from it altogether pity orgive me life my dear pickwick has become insupportable to me the spirit which burns within us is a porter s knot on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles and when that spirit fails us the burden is too heavy to be borne we sink beneath it you may tell rachael h that name tracy tupman we must leave this place directly said mr pickwick as he refolded the note it would not have been decent for us to remain here under any circumstances after what has happened and now we are bound to follow in search of our friend and so saying he led the way to the house his intention was rapidly communicated the entreaties to remain were pressing but mr pickwick was inflexible business he said required his immediate attendance the old clergyman was present you are not really going said he taking mr pickwick aside mr pickwick reiterated his former determination then here said the old gentleman is a little manuscript which i had hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself i found it on the death of a friend of mine medical man engaged in our county lunatic asylum mong a variety of papers which i had the option of destroying or preserving as i thought proper i can hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine though it certainly is not in my friend s hand however whether it be the genuine production of a maniac or founded upon the ravings of some unhappy being which i think more probabl read it and judge for yourself mr pickwick received the manuscript and parted from the benevolent old gentleman with many expressions of goodill and esteem it was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of manor farm from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness mr pickwick kissed the young ladies e were going to say as if they were his own daughters only as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation the comparison would not be quite appropriate ugged the old lady with filial cordiality and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval the exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and mr trundle was even more hearty and prolonged and it was not until mr snodgrass had been several times called for and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by emily whose bright eyes looked unusually that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers many a backward look they gave at the farm as they walked slowly away and many a kiss did mr snodgrass waft in the air in acknowledgment of something very like a lady s handkerchief which was waved from one of the upper windows until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight at muggleton they procured a conveyance to rochester by the time they reached the lastamed place the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner and having procured the necessary information relative to the road the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to cobham a delightful walk it was for it was a pleasant afternoon in june and their way lay through a deep and shady wood cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs the ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat they emerged upon an open park with an ancient hall displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of elizabeth s time long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer if this said mr pickwick looking about him if this were the place to which all who are troubled with our friend s complaint came i fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return i think so too said mr winkle and really added mr pickwick after half an hour s walking had brought them to the village really for a misanthrope s choice this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence i ever met with in this opinion also both mr winkle and mr snodgrass expressed their concurrence and having been directed to the leather bottle a clean and commodious village aleouse the three travellers entered and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of tupman show the gentlemen into the parlour tom said the landlady a stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage and the three friends entered a long lowoofed room furnished with a large number of highacked leatherushioned chairs of fantastic shapes and embellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughlyoloured prints of some antiquity at the upper end of the room was a table with a white cloth upon it well covered with a roast fowl bacon ale and et ceteras and at the table sat mr tupman looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world as possible on the entrance of his friends that gentleman laid down his knife and fork and with a mournful air advanced to meet them i did not expect to see you here he said as he grasped mr pickwick s hand it s very kind ah said mr pickwick sitting down and wiping from his forehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered finish your dinner and walk out with me i wish to speak to you alone mr tupman did as he was desired and mr pickwick having refreshed himself with a copious draught of ale waited his friend s leisure the dinner was quickly despatched and they walked out together for half an hour their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard to and fro while mr pickwick was engaged in combating his companion s resolution any repetition of his arguments would be useless for what language could convey to them that energy and force which their great originator s manner communicated whether mr tupman was already tired of retirement or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal which was made to him matters not he did not resist it at last it mattered little to him he said where he dragged out the miserable remainder of his days and since his friend laid so much stress upon his humble companionship he was willing to share his adventures mr pickwick smiled they shook hands and walked back to rejoin their companions it was at this moment that mr pickwick made that immortal discovery which has been the pride and boast of his friends and the envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country they had passed the door of their inn and walked a little way down the village before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood as they turned back mr pickwick s eye fell upon a small broken stone partially buried in the ground in front of a cottage door he paused this is very strange said mr pickwick what is strange inquired mr tupman staring eagerly at every object near him but the right one god bless me what s the matter this last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment occasioned by seeing mr pickwick in his enthusiasm for discovery fall on his knees before the little stone and commence wiping the dust off it with his pocketandkerchief there is an inscription here said mr pickwick is it possible said mr tupman i can discern continued mr pickwick rubbing away with all his might and gazing intently through his spectacles i can discern a cross and a and then a t this is important continued mr pickwick starting up this is some very old inscription existing perhaps long before the ancient almsouses in this place it must not be lost he tapped at the cottage door a labouring man opened it do you know how this stone came here my friend inquired the benevolent mr pickwick no i doan t sir replied the man civilly it was here long afore i was born or any on us mr pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion you ou re not particularly attached to it i dare say said mr pickwick trembling with anxiety you wouldn t mind selling it now ah but who buy it inquired the man with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning i give you ten shillings for it at once said mr pickwick if you would take it up for me the astonishment of the village may be easily imagined when the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spad mr pickwick by dint of great personal exertion bore it with his own hands to the inn and after having carefully washed it deposited it on the table the exultation and joy of the pickwickians knew no bounds when their patience and assiduity their washing and scraping were crowned with success the stone was uneven and broken and the letters were straggling and irregular but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered cros b i s t u p s h i s ark mr pickwick s eyes sparkled with delight as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered he had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition in a county known to abound in the remains of the early ages in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time he e the chairman of the pickwick club ad discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him he could hardly trust the evidence of his senses this his said he determines me we return to town toorrow toorrow exclaimed his admiring followers toorrow said mr pickwick this treasure must be at once deposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood i have another reason for this step in a few days an election is to take place for the borough of eatanswill at which mr perker a gentleman whom i lately met is the agent of one of the candidates we will behold and minutely examine a scene so interesting to every englishman we will was the animated cry of three voices mr pickwick looked round him the attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him he was their leader and he felt it let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass said he this proposition like the other was received with unanimous applause having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box purchased from the landlady for the purpose he placed himself in an armhair at the head of the table and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation it was past eleven o clock late hour for the little village of cobham hen mr pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been prepared for his reception he threw open the lattice window and setting his light upon the table fell into a train of meditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days the hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation mr pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve the first stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear but when the bell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable e almost felt as if he had lost a companion he was nervous and excited and hastily undressing himself and placing his light in the chimney got into bed every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind in which a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to sleep it was mr pickwick s condition at this moment he tossed first on one side and then on the other and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber it was of no use whether it was the unwonted exertion he had undergone or the heat or the brandynd water or the strange bed hatever it was his thoughts kept reverting very uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs and the old stories to which they had given rise in the course of the evening after half an hour s tumbling about he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion that it was of no use trying to sleep so he got up and partially dressed himself anything he thought was better than lying there fancying all kinds of horrors he looked out of the window t was very dark he walked about the room t was very lonely he had taken a few turns from the door to the window and from the window to the door when the clergyman s manuscript for the first time entered his head it was a good thought if it failed to interest him it might send him to sleep he took it from his coat pocket and drawing a small table towards his bedside trimmed the light put on his spectacles and composed himself to read it was a strange handwriting and the paper was much soiled and blotted the title gave him a sudden start too and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings however he trimmed the light again and read as follows a madman s manuscript yes madman s how that word would have struck to my heart many years ago how it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me sometimes sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins till the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin and my knees knocked together with fright i like it now though it s a fine name show me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madman s eye hose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman s gripe ho ho it s a grand thing to be mad to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars o gnash one s teeth and howl through the long still night to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw transported with such brave music hurrah for the madhouse oh it s a rare place i remember days when i was afraid of being mad when i used to start from my sleep and fall upon my knees and pray to be spared from the curse of my race when i rushed from the sight of merriment or happiness to hide myself in some lonely place and spend the weary hours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my brain i knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood and the marrow of my bones that one generation had passed away without the pestilence appearing among them and that i was the first in whom it would revive i knew it must be so that so it always had been and so it ever would be and when i cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded room and saw men whisper and point and turn their eyes towards me i knew they were telling each other of the doomed madman and i slunk away again to mope in solitude i did this for years long long years they were the nights here are long sometimes ery long but they are nothing to the restless nights and dreadful dreams i had at that time it makes me cold to remember them large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the corners of the room and bent over my bed at night tempting me to madness they told me in low whispers that the floor of the old house in which my father died was stained with his own blood shed by his own hand in raging madness i drove my fingers into my ears but they screamed into my head till the room rang with it that in one generation before him the madness slumbered but that his grandfather had lived for years with his hands fettered to the ground to prevent his tearing himself to pieces i knew they told the truth knew it well i had found it out years before though they had tried to keep it from me ha ha i was too cunning for them madman as they thought me at last it came upon me and i wondered how i could ever have feared it i could go into the world now and laugh and shout with the best among them i knew i was mad but they did not even suspect it how i used to hug myself with delight when i thought of the fine trick i was playing them after their old pointing and leering when i was not mad but only dreading that i might one day become so and how i used to laugh for joy when i was alone and thought how well i kept my secret and how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me if they had known the truth i could have screamed with ecstasy when i dined alone with some fine roaring fellow to think how pale he would have turned and how fast he would have run if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him sharpening a bright glittering knife was a madman with all the power and half the will to plunge it in his heart oh it was a merry life riches became mine wealth poured in upon me and i rioted in pleasures enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my wellept secret i inherited an estate the law he eagleyed law itself ad been deceived and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman s hands where was the wit of the sharpighted men of sound mind where the dexterity of the lawyers eager to discover a flaw the madman s cunning had overreached them all i had money how i was courted i spent it profusely how i was praised how those three proud overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me the old whiteeaded father too uch deference uch respect uch devoted friendship e worshipped me the old man had a daughter and the young men a sister and all the five were poor i was rich and when i married the girl i saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives as they thought of their welllanned scheme and their fine prize it was for me to smile to smile to laugh outright and tear my hair and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment they little thought they had married her to a madman stay if they had known it would they have saved her a sister s happiness against her husband s gold the lightest feather i blow into the air against the gay chain that ornaments my body in one thing i was deceived with all my cunning if i had not been mad or though we madmen are sharpitted enough we get bewildered sometimes should have known that the girl would rather have been placed stiff and cold in a dull leaden coffin than borne an envied bride to my rich glittering house i should have known that her heart was with the darkyed boy whose name i once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep and that she had been sacrificed to me to relieve the poverty of the old whiteeaded man and the haughty brothers i don t remember forms or faces now but i know the girl was beautiful i know she was for in the bright moonlight nights when i start up from my sleep and all is quiet about me i see standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell a slight and wasted figure with long black hair which streaming down her back stirs with no earthly wind and eyes that fix their gaze on me and never wink or close hush the blood chills at my heart as i write it down hat form is her s the face is very pale and the eyes are glassy bright but i know them well that figure never moves it never frowns and mouths as others do that fill this place sometimes but it is much more dreadful to me even than the spirits that tempted me many years ago t comes fresh from the grave and is so very deathike for nearly a year i saw that face grow paler for nearly a year i saw the tears steal down the mournful cheeks and never knew the cause i found it out at last though they could not keep it from me long she had never liked me i had never thought she did she despised my wealth and hated the splendour in which she lived but i had not expected that she loved another this i had never thought of strange feelings came over me and thoughts forced upon me by some secret power whirled round and round my brain i did not hate her though i hated the boy she still wept for i pitied es i pitied he wretched life to which her cold and selfish relations had doomed her i knew that she could not live long but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some illated being destined to hand down madness to its offspring determined me i resolved to kill her for many weeks i thought of poison and then of drowning and then of fire a fine sight the grand house in flames and the madman s wife smouldering away to cinders think of the jest of a large reward too and of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did and all through a madman s cunning i thought often of this but i gave it up at last oh the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day feeling the sharp edge and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin bright edge would make at last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered in my ear that the time was come and thrust the open razor into my hand i grasped it firmly rose softly from the bed and leaned over my sleeping wife her face was buried in her hands i withdrew them softly and they fell listlessly on her bosom she had been weeping for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek her face was calm and placid and even as i looked upon it a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features i laid my hand softly on her shoulder she started t was only a passing dream i leaned forward again she screamed and woke one motion of my hand and she would never again have uttered cry or sound but i was startled and drew back her eyes were fixed on mine i knew not how it was but they cowed and frightened me and i quailed beneath them she rose from the bed still gazing fixedly and steadily on me i trembled the razor was in my hand but i could not move she made towards the door as she neared it she turned and withdrew her eyes from my face the spell was broken i bounded forward and clutched her by the arm uttering shriek upon shriek she sank upon the ground now i could have killed her without a struggle but the house was alarmed i heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs i replaced the razor in its usual drawer unfastened the door and called loudly for assistance they came and raised her and placed her on the bed she lay bereft of animation for hours and when life look and speech returned her senses had deserted her and she raved wildly and furiously doctors were called in reat men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages with fine horses and gaudy servants they were at her bedside for weeks they had a great meeting and consulted together in low and solemn voices in another room one the cleverest and most celebrated among them took me aside and bidding me prepare for the worst told me e the madman hat my wife was mad he stood close beside me at an open window his eyes looking in my face and his hand laid upon my arm with one effort i could have hurled him into the street beneath it would have been rare sport to have done it but my secret was at stake and i let him go a few days after they told me i must place her under some restraint i must provide a keeper for her i i went into the open fields where none could hear me and laughed till the air resounded with my shouts she died next day the whiteeaded old man followed her to the grave and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron all this was food for my secret mirth and i laughed behind the white handkerchief which i held up to my face as we rode home till the tears came into my eyes but though i had carried my object and killed her i was restless and disturbed and i felt that before long my secret must be known i could not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me and made me when i was alone at home jump up and beat my hands together and dance round and round and roar aloud when i went out and saw the busy crowds hurrying about the streets or to the theatre and heard the sound of music and beheld the people dancing i felt such glee that i could have rushed among them and torn them to pieces limb from limb and howled in transport but i ground my teeth and struck my feet upon the floor and drove my sharp nails into my hands i kept it down and no one knew i was a madman yet i remember hough it s one of the last things i can remember for now i up realities with my dreams and having so much to do and being always hurried here have no time to separate the two from some strange confusion in which they get involved remember how i let it out at last ha ha i think i see their frightened looks now and feel the ease with which i flung them from me and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces and then flew like the wind and left them screaming and shouting far behind the strength of a giant comes upon me when i think of it there how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench i could snap it like a twig only there are long galleries here with many doors don t think i could find my way along them and even if i could i know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred they know what a clever madman i have been and they are proud to have me here to show let me see yes i had been out it was late at night when i reached home and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see me rgent business he said i recollect it well i hated that man with all a madman s hate many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him they told me he was there i ran swiftly upstairs he had a word to say to me i dismissed the servants it was late and we were alone together or the first time i kept my eyes carefully from him at first for i knew what he little thought nd i gloried in the knowledge hat the light of madness gleamed from them like fire we sat in silence for a few minutes he spoke at last my recent dissipation and strange remarks made so soon after his sister s death were an insult to her memory coupling together many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation he thought i had not treated her well he wished to know whether he was right in inferring that i meant to cast a reproach upon her memory and a disrespect upon her family it was due to the uniform he wore to demand this explanation this man had a commission in the army commission purchased with my money and his sister s misery this was the man who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me and grasp my wealth this was the man who had been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me well knowing that her heart was given to that puling boy due to his uniform the livery of his degradation i turned my eyes upon him could not help it ut i spoke not a word i saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze he was a bold man but the colour faded from his face and he drew back his chair i dragged mine nearer to him and i laughed was very merry then saw him shudder i felt the madness rising within me he was afraid of me you were very fond of your sister when she was alive i said very he looked uneasily round him and i saw his hand grasp the back of his chair but he said nothing you villain said i i found you out i discovered your hellish plots against me i know her heart was fixed on some one else before you compelled her to marry me i know it know it he jumped suddenly from his chair brandished it aloft and bid me stand back or i took care to be getting closer to him all the time i spoke i screamed rather than talked for i felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out damn you said i starting up and rushing upon him i killed her i am a madman down with you blood blood i will have it i turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror and closed with him and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together it was a fine struggle that for he was a tall strong man fighting for his life and i a powerful madman thirsting to destroy him i knew no strength could equal mine and i was right right again though a madman his struggles grew fainter i knelt upon his chest and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands his face grew purple his eyes were starting from his head and with protruded tongue he seemed to mock me i squeezed the tighter the door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise and a crowd of people rushed forward crying aloud to each other to secure the madman my secret was out and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom i gained my feet before a hand was on me threw myself among my assailants and cleared my way with my strong arm as if i bore a hatchet in my hand and hewed them down before me i gained the door dropped over the banisters and in an instant was in the street straight and swift i ran and no one dared to stop me i heard the noise of the feet behind and redoubled my speed it grew fainter and fainter in the distance and at length died away altogether but on i bounded through marsh and rivulet over fence and wall with a wild shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side and swelled the sound till it pierced the air i was borne upon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind and bore down bank and hedge before them and spun me round and round with a rustle and a speed that made my head swim until at last they threw me from them with a violent shock and i fell heavily upon the earth when i woke i found myself here ere in this gray cell where the sunlight seldom comes and the moon steals in in rays which only serve to show the dark shadows about me and that silent figure in its old corner when i lie awake i can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place what they are i know not but they neither come from that pale form nor does it regard them for from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning it still stands motionless in the same place listening to the music of my iron chain and watching my gambols on my straw bed at the end of the manuscript was written in another hand this note the unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired the thoughtless riot dissipation and debauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium the first effects of the latter was the strange delusion founded upon a wellnown medical theory strongly contended for by some and as strongly contested by others that an hereditary madness existed in his family this produced a settled gloom which in time developed a morbid insanity and finally terminated in raving madness there is every reason to believe that the events he detailed though distorted in the description by his diseased imagination really happened it is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of his early career that his passions when no longer controlled by reason did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds mr pickwick s candle was just expiring in the socket as he concluded the perusal of the old clergyman s manuscript and when the light went suddenly out without any previous flicker by way of warning it communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from his uneasy bed and casting a fearful glance around he once more scrambled hastily between the sheets and soon fell fast asleep the sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber when he awoke and the morning was far advanced the gloom which had oppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself after a hearty breakfast the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to gravesend followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box they reached the town about one o clock their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city from rocheste and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach arrived in london in sound health and spirits on that same afternoon the next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were necessary for their journey to the borough of eatanswill as any references to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this to narrate with great brevity the history of the antiquarian discovery it appears from the transactions of the club then that mr pickwick lectured upon the discovery at a general club meeting convened on the night succeeding their return and entered into a variety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription it also appears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity which was engraven on stone and presented to the royal antiquarian society and other learned bodies that hearturnings and jealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon the subject and that mr pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet containing ninetyix pages of very small print and twentyeven different readings of the inscription that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons with a shilling aiece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the fragment and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off prematurely in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning that mr pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign societies for making the discovery that none of the seventeen could make anything of it but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary mr blotton indeed nd the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime r blotton we say with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds presumed to state a view of the case as degrading as ridiculous mr blotton with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of pickwick actually undertook a journey to cobham in person and on his return sarcastically observed in an oration at the club that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased that the man presumed the stone to be ancient but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than the simple construction of bill stumps his mark and that mr stumps being little in the habit of original composition and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of orthography had omitted the concluding of his christian name the pickwick club as might have been expected from so enlightened an institutio received this statement with the contempt it deserved expelled the presumptuous and illonditioned blotton from the society and voted mr pickwick a pair of gold spectacles in token of their confidence and approbation in return for which mr pickwick caused a portrait of himself to be painted and hung up in the club room mr blotton was ejected but not conquered he also wrote a pamphlet addressed to the seventeen learned societies native and foreign containing a repetition of the statement he had already made and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many humbugs hereupon the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused several fresh pamphlets appeared the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into english the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men as the pickwick controversy but this base attempt to injure mr pickwick recoiled upon the head of its calumnious author the seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the presumptuous blotton an ignorant meddler and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever and to this day the stone remains an illegible monument of mr pickwick s greatness and a lasting trophy to the littleness of his enemies chapter descriptive of a very important proceeding on the part of mr pickwick no less an epoch in his life than in this history mr pickwick s apartments in goswell street although on a limited scale were not only of a very neat and comfortable description but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and observation his sittingoom was the firstloor front his bedroom the secondloor front and thus whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour or standing before the dressinglass in his dormitory he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare his landlady mrs bardell he relict and sole executrix of a deceased customouse officer as a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance with a natural genius for cooking improved by study and long practice into an exquisite talent there were no children no servants no fowls the only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy the first a lodger the second a production of mrs bardell s the large man was always home precisely at ten o clock at night at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish french bedstead in the back parlour and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of master bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house and in it mr pickwick s will was law to any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment and conversant with the admirable regulation of mr pickwick s mind his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable he paced the room to and fro with hurried steps popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each constantly referred to his watch and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him it was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation but what that something was not even mrs bardell had been enabled to discover mrs bardell said mr pickwick at last as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment sir said mrs bardell your little boy is a very long time gone why it s a good long way to the borough sir remonstrated mrs bardell ah said mr pickwick very true so it is mr pickwick relapsed into silence and mrs bardell resumed her dusting mrs bardell said mr pickwick at the expiration of a few minutes sir said mrs bardell again do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people than to keep one la mr pickwick said mrs bardell colouring up to the very border of her cap as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger la mr pickwick what a question well but do you inquired mr pickwick that depends said mrs bardell approaching the duster very near to mr pickwick s elbow which was planted on the table that depends a good deal upon the person you know mr pickwick and whether it s a saving and careful person sir that s very true said mr pickwick but the person i have in my eye here he looked very hard at mrs bardel i think possesses these qualities and has moreover a considerable knowledge of the world and a great deal of sharpness mrs bardell which may be of material use to me la mr pickwick said mrs bardell the crimson rising to her cap border again i do said mr pickwick growing energetic as was his wont in speaking of a subject which interested him i do indeed and to tell you the truth mrs bardell i have made up my mind dear me sir exclaimed mrs bardell you think it very strange now said the amiable mr pickwick with a goodumoured glance at his companion that i never consulted you about this matter and never even mentioned it till i sent your little boy out this morning h mrs bardell could only reply by a look she had long worshipped mr pickwick at a distance but here she was all at once raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire mr pickwick was going to propose deliberate plan too sent her little boy to the borough to get him out of the way ow thoughtful ow considerate well said mr pickwick what do you think oh mr pickwick said mrs bardell trembling with agitation you re very kind sir it save you a good deal of trouble won t it said mr pickwick oh i never thought anything of the trouble sir replied mrs bardell and of course i should take more trouble to please you then than ever but it is so kind of you mr pickwick to have so much consideration for my loneliness ah to be sure said mr pickwick i never thought of that when i am in town you always have somebody to sit with you to be sure so you will i am sure i ought to be a very happy woman said mrs bardell and your little boy said mr pickwick bless his heart interposed mrs bardell with a maternal sob he too will have a companion resumed mr pickwick a lively one who teach him i be bound more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year and mr pickwick smiled placidly oh you dear said mrs bardell mr pickwick started oh you kind good playful dear said mrs bardell and without more ado she rose from her chair and flung her arms round mr pickwick s neck with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs bless my soul cried the astonished mr pickwick mrs bardell my good woman ear me what a situation ray consider rs bardell don t f anybody should come oh let them come exclaimed mrs bardell frantically i never leave you ear kind good soul and with these words mrs bardell clung the tighter mercy upon me said mr pickwick struggling violently i hear somebody coming up the stairs don t don t there s a good creature don t but entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing for mrs bardell had fainted in mr pickwick s arms and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair master bardell entered the room ushering in mr tupman mr winkle and mr snodgrass mr pickwick was struck motionless and speechless he stood with his lovely burden in his arms gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation they in their turn stared at him and master bardell in his turn stared at everybody the astonishment of the pickwickians was so absorbing and the perplexity of mr pickwick was so extreme that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son clad in a tight suit of corduroy spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain but by degrees the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind and considering mr pickwick as the aggressor he set up an appalling and semiarthly kind of howling and butting forward with his head commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm and the violence of his excitement allowed take this little villain away said the agonised mr pickwick he s mad what is the matter said the three tongueied pickwickians i don t know replied mr pickwick pettishly take away the boy here mr winkle carried the interesting boy screaming and struggling to the farther end of the apartment now help me lead this woman downstairs oh i am better now said mrs bardell faintly let me lead you downstairs said the everallant mr tupman thank you sir hank you exclaimed mrs bardell hysterically and downstairs she was led accordingly accompanied by her affectionate son i cannot conceive said mr pickwick when his friend returned i cannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman i had merely announced to her my intention of keeping a manervant when she fell into the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her very extraordinary thing very said his three friends placed me in such an extremely awkward situation continued mr pickwick very was the reply of his followers as they coughed slightly and looked dubiously at each other this behaviour was not lost upon mr pickwick he remarked their incredulity they evidently suspected him there is a man in the passage now said mr tupman it s the man i spoke to you about said mr pickwick i sent for him to the borough this morning have the goodness to call him up snodgrass mr snodgrass did as he was desired and mr samuel weller forthwith presented himself oh ou remember me i suppose said mr pickwick i should think so replied sam with a patronising wink queer start that ere but he was one too many for you warn t he up to snuff and a pinch or two over h never mind that matter now said mr pickwick hastily i want to speak to you about something else sit down thank sir said sam and down he sat without further bidding having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door tain t a wery good un to look at said sam but it s an astonishin un to wear and afore the brim went it was a wery handsome tile hows ever it s lighter without it that s one thing and every hole lets in some air that s another entilation gossamer i calls it on the delivery of this sentiment mr weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled pickwickians now with regard to the matter on which i with the concurrence of these gentlemen sent for you said mr pickwick that s the pint sir interposed sam out vith it as the father said to his child when he swallowed a farden we want to know in the first place said mr pickwick whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation afore i answers that ere question gen n replied mr weller i should like to know in the first place whether you re aoin to purwide me with a better a sunbeam of placid benevolence played on mr pickwick s features as he said i have half made up my mind to engage you myself have you though said sam mr pickwick nodded in the affirmative wages inquired sam twelve pounds a year replied mr pickwick clothes two suits work to attend upon me and travel about with me and these gentlemen here take the bill down said sam emphatically i let to a single gentleman and the terms is agreed upon you accept the situation inquired mr pickwick cert nly replied sam if the clothes fits me half as well as the place they do you can get a character of course said mr pickwick ask the landlady o the white hart about that sir replied sam can you come this evening i get into the clothes this minute if they re here said sam with great alacrity call at eight this evening said mr pickwick and if the inquiries are satisfactory they shall be provided with the single exception of one amiable indiscretion in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated the history of mr weller s conduct was so very blameless that mr pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening with the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings but all the private actions of this extraordinary man he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen s new and secondand clothes are provided and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with and before night had closed in mr weller was furnished with a grey coat with the p button a black hat with a cockade to it a pink striped waistcoat light breeches and gaiters and a variety of other necessaries too numerous to recapitulate well said that suddenlyransformed individual as he took his seat on the outside of the eatanswill coach next morning i wonder whether i meant to be a footman or a groom or a gamekeeper or a seedsman i looks like a sort of compo of every one on em never mind there s a change of air plenty to see and little to do and all this suits my complaint uncommon so long life to the pickvicks says i chapter some account of eatanswill of the state of parties therein and of the election of a member to serve in parliament for that ancient loyal and patriotic borough we will frankly acknowledge that up to the period of our being first immersed in the voluminous papers of the pickwick club we had never heard of eatanswill we will with equal candour admit that we have in vain searched for proof of the actual existence of such a place at the present day knowing the deep reliance to be placed on every note and statement of mr pickwick s and not presuming to set up our recollection against the recorded declarations of that great man we have consulted every authority bearing upon the subject to which we could possibly refer we have traced every name in schedules a and b without meeting with that of eatanswill we have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers and the same result has attended our investigation we are therefore led to believe that mr pickwick with that anxious desire to abstain from giving offence to any and with those delicate feelings for which all who knew him well know he was so eminently remarkable purposely substituted a fictitious designation for the real name of the place in which his observations were made we are confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance apparently slight and trivial in itself but when considered in this point of view not undeserving of notice in mr pickwick s noteook we can just trace an entry of the fact that the places of himself and followers were booked by the norwich coach but this entry was afterwards lined through as if for the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is situated we will not therefore hazard a guess upon the subject but will at once proceed with this history content with the materials which its characters have provided for us it appears then that the eatanswill people like the people of many other small towns considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty importance and that every man in eatanswill conscious of the weight that attached to his example felt himself bound to unite heart and soul with one of the two great parties that divided the town he blues and the buffs now the blues lost no opportunity of opposing the buffs and the buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the blues and the consequence was that whenever the buffs and blues met together at public meeting townall fair or market disputes and high words arose between them with these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in eatanswill was made a party question if the buffs proposed to new skylight the marketlace the blues got up public meetings and denounced the proceeding if the blues proposed the erection of an additional pump in the high street the buffs rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity there were blue shops and buff shops blue inns and buff inns here was a blue aisle and a buff aisle in the very church itself of course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of these powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative and accordingly there were two newspapers in the town he eatanswill gazette and the eatanswill independent the former advocating blue principles and the latter conducted on grounds decidedly buff fine newspapers they were such leading articles and such spirited attacks our worthless contemporary the gazette that disgraceful and dastardly journal the independent that false and scurrilous print the independent that vile and slanderous calumniator the gazette these and other spirittirring denunciations were strewn plentifully over the columns of each in every number and excited feelings of the most intense delight and indignation in the bosoms of the townspeople mr pickwick with his usual foresight and sagacity had chosen a peculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough never was such a contest known the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall was the blue candidate and horatio fizkin esq of fizkin lodge near eatanswill had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward on the buff interest the gazette warned the electors of eatanswill that the eyes not only of england but of the whole civilised world were upon them and the independent imperatively demanded to know whether the constituency of eatanswill were the grand fellows they had always taken them for or base and servile tools undeserving alike of the name of englishmen and the blessings of freedom never had such a commotion agitated the town before it was late in the evening when mr pickwick and his companions assisted by sam dismounted from the roof of the eatanswill coach large blue silk flags were flying from the windows of the town arms inn and bills were posted in every sash intimating in gigantic letters that the honourable samuel slumkey s committee sat there daily a crowd of idlers were assembled in the road looking at a hoarse man in the balcony who was apparently talking himself very red in the face in mr slumkey s behalf but the force and point of whose arguments were somewhat impaired by the perpetual beating of four large drums which mr fizkin s committee had stationed at the street corner there was a busy little man beside him though who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer which they regularly did most enthusiastically and as the redaced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him the pickwickians had no sooner dismounted than they were surrounded by a branch mob of the honest and independent who forthwith set up three deafening cheers which being responded to by the main body for it s not at all necessary for a crowd to know what they are cheering abou swelled into a tremendous roar of triumph which stopped even the red faced man in the balcony hurrah shouted the mob in conclusion one cheer more screamed the little fugleman in the balcony and out shouted the mob again as if lungs were castron with steel works slumkey for ever roared the honest and independent slumkey for ever echoed mr pickwick taking off his hat no fizkin roared the crowd certainly not shouted mr pickwick hurrah and then there was another roaring like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat who is slumkey whispered mr tupman i don t know replied mr pickwick in the same tone hush don t ask any questions it s always best on these occasions to do what the mob do but suppose there are two mobs suggested mr snodgrass shout with the largest replied mr pickwick volumes could not have said more they entered the house the crowd opening right and left to let them pass and cheering vociferously the first object of consideration was to secure quarters for the night can we have beds here inquired mr pickwick summoning the waiter don t know sir replied the man afraid we re full sir inquire sir away he went for that purpose and presently returned to ask whether the gentleman were blue as neither mr pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in the cause of either candidate the question was rather a difficult one to answer in this dilemma mr pickwick bethought himself of his new friend mr perker do you know a gentleman of the name of perker inquired mr pickwick certainly sir honourable mr samuel slumkey s agent he is blue i think oh yes sir then we are blue said mr pickwick but observing that the man looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement he gave him his card and desired him to present it to mr perker forthwith if he should happen to be in the house the waiter retired and reappearing almost immediately with a request that mr pickwick would follow him led the way to a large room on the first floor where seated at a long table covered with books and papers was mr perker ah h my dear sir said the little man advancing to meet him very happy to see you my dear sir very pray sit down so you have carried your intention into effect you have come down here to see an election eh mr pickwick replied in the affirmative spirited contest my dear sir said the little man i delighted to hear it said mr pickwick rubbing his hands i like to see sturdy patriotism on whatever side it is called forth nd so it s a spirited contest oh yes said the little man very much so indeed we have opened all the publicouses in the place and left our adversary nothing but the beerhops asterly stroke of policy that my dear sir eh the little man smiled complacently and took a large pinch of snuff and what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest inquired mr pickwick why doubtful my dear sir rather doubtful as yet replied the little man fizkin s people have got threendhirty voters in the lockp coachouse at the white hart in the coachouse said mr pickwick considerably astonished by this second stroke of policy they keep em locked up there till they want em resumed the little man the effect of that is you see to prevent our getting at them and even if we could it would be of no use for they keep them very drunk on purpose smart fellow fizkin s agent ery smart fellow indeed mr pickwick stared but said nothing we are pretty confident though said mr perker sinking his voice almost to a whisper we had a little teaarty here last night ive andorty women my dear sir nd gave every one of em a green parasol when she went away a parasol said mr pickwick fact my dear sir fact fivendorty green parasols at seven and sixpence aiece all women like finery xtraordinary the effect of those parasols secured all their husbands and half their brothers beats stockings and flannel and all that sort of thing hollow my idea my dear sir entirely hail rain or sunshine you can t walk half a dozen yards up the street without encountering half a dozen green parasols here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth which was only checked by the entrance of a third party this was a tall thin man with a sandyoloured head inclined to baldness and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look of unfathomable profundity he was dressed in a long brown surtout with a black cloth waistcoat and drab trousers a double eyeglass dangled at his waistcoat and on his head he wore a very lowrowned hat with a broad brim the newomer was introduced to mr pickwick as mr pott the editor of the eatanswill gazette after a few preliminary remarks mr pott turned round to mr pickwick and said with solemnity this contest excites great interest in the metropolis sir i believe it does said mr pickwick to which i have reason to know said pott looking towards mr perker for corroboration to which i have reason to know that my article of last saturday in some degree contributed not the least doubt of it said the little man the press is a mighty engine sir said pott mr pickwick yielded his fullest assent to the proposition but i trust sir said pott that i have never abused the enormous power i wield i trust sir that i have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands against the sacred bosom of private life or the tender breast of individual reputation i trust sir that i have devoted my energies to o endeavours umble they may be humble i know they are o instil those principles of hich re here the editor of the eatanswill gazette appearing to ramble mr pickwick came to his relief and said certainly and what sir said pott what sir let me ask you as an impartial man is the state of the public mind in london with reference to my contest with the independent greatly excited no doubt interposed mr perker with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental the contest said pott shall be prolonged so long as i have health and strength and that portion of talent with which i am gifted from that contest sir although it may unsettle men s minds and excite their feelings and render them incapable for the discharge of the everyday duties of ordinary life from that contest sir i will never shrink till i have set my heel upon the eatanswill independent i wish the people of london and the people of this country to know sir that they may rely upon me hat i will not desert them that i am resolved to stand by them sir to the last your conduct is most noble sir said mr pickwick and he grasped the hand of the magnanimous pott you are sir i perceive a man of sense and talent said mr pott almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration i am most happy sir to make the acquaintance of such a man and i said mr pickwick feel deeply honoured by this expression of your opinion allow me sir to introduce you to my fellowravellers the other corresponding members of the club i am proud to have founded i shall be delighted said mr pott mr pickwick withdrew and returning with his friends presented them in due form to the editor of the eatanswill gazette now my dear pott said little mr perker the question is what are we to do with our friends here we can stop in this house i suppose said mr pickwick not a spare bed in the house my dear sir ot a single bed extremely awkward said mr pickwick very said his fellowoyagers i have an idea upon this subject said mr pott which i think may be very successfully adopted they have two beds at the peacock and i can boldly say on behalf of mrs pott that she will be delighted to accommodate mr pickwick and any one of his friends if the other two gentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting as they best can at the peacock after repeated pressings on the part of mr pott and repeated protestations on that of mr pickwick that he could not think of incommoding or troubling his amiable wife it was decided that it was the only feasible arrangement that could be made so it was made and after dinner together at the town arms the friends separated mr tupman and mr snodgrass repairing to the peacock and mr pickwick and mr winkle proceeding to the mansion of mr pott it having been previously arranged that they should all reassemble at the town arms in the morning and accompany the honourable samuel slumkey s procession to the place of nomination mr pott s domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife all men whom mighty genius has raised to a proud eminence in the world have usually some little weakness which appears the more conspicuous from the contrast it presents to their general character if mr pott had a weakness it was perhaps that he was rather too submissive to the somewhat contemptuous control and sway of his wife we do not feel justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact because on the present occasion all mrs pott s most winning ways were brought into requisition to receive the two gentlemen my dear said mr pott mr pickwick r pickwick of london mrs pott received mr pickwick s paternal grasp of the hand with enchanting sweetness and mr winkle who had not been announced at all sidled and bowed unnoticed in an obscure corner p my dear aid mrs pott my life said mr pott pray introduce the other gentleman i beg a thousand pardons said mr pott permit me mrs pott mr winkle said mr pickwick winkle echoed mr pott and the ceremony of introduction was complete we owe you many apologies ma am said mr pickwick for disturbing your domestic arrangements at so short a notice i beg you won t mention it sir replied the feminine pott with vivacity it is a high treat to me i assure you to see any new faces living as i do from day to day and week to week in this dull place and seeing nobody nobody my dear exclaimed mr pott archly nobody but you retorted mrs pott with asperity you see mr pickwick said the host in explanation of his wife s lament that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and pleasures of which we might otherwise partake my public station as editor of the eatanswill gazette the position which that paper holds in the country my constant immersion in the vortex of politics p my dear interposed mrs pott my life said the editor i wish my dear you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest but my love said mr pott with great humility mr pickwick does take an interest in it it s well for him if he can said mrs pott emphatically i am wearied out of my life with your politics and quarrels with the independent and nonsense i am quite astonished p at your making such an exhibition of your absurdity but my dear said mr pott oh nonsense don t talk to me said mrs pott do you play ecarte sir i shall be very happy to learn under your tuition replied mr winkle well then draw that little table into this window and let me get out of hearing of those prosy politics jane said mr pott to the servant who brought in candles go down into the office and bring me up the file of the gazette for eighteen hundred and twentyix i read you added the editor turning to mr pickwick i just read you a few of the leaders i wrote at that time upon the buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike here i rather think they amuse you i should like to hear them very much indeed said mr pickwick up came the file and down sat the editor with mr pickwick at his side we have in vain pored over the leaves of mr pickwick s noteook in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions we have every reason to believe that he was perfectly enraptured with the vigour and freshness of the style indeed mr winkle has recorded the fact that his eyes were closed as if with excess of pleasure during the whole time of their perusal the announcement of supper put a stop both to the game of ecarte and the recapitulation of the beauties of the eatanswill gazette mrs pott was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour mr winkle had already made considerable progress in her good opinion and she did not hesitate to inform him confidentially that mr pickwick was a delightful old dear these terms convey a familiarity of expression in which few of those who were intimately acquainted with that colossalinded man would have presumed to indulge we have preserved them nevertheless as affording at once a touching and a convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society and the case with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings it was a late hour of the night ong after mr tupman and mr snodgrass had fallen asleep in the inmost recesses of the peacock hen the two friends retired to rest slumber soon fell upon the senses of mr winkle but his feelings had been excited and his admiration roused and for many hours after sleep had rendered him insensible to earthly objects the face and figure of the agreeable mrs pott presented themselves again and again to his wandering imagination the noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to dispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence any associations but those which were immediately connected with the rapidlypproaching election the beating of drums the blowing of horns and trumpets the shouting of men and tramping of horses echoed and rechoed through the streets from the earliest dawn of day and an occasional fight between the light skirmishers of either party at once enlivened the preparations and agreeably diversified their character well sam said mr pickwick as his valet appeared at his bedroom door just as he was concluding his toilet all alive toay i suppose reg lar game sir replied mr weller our people s aollecting down at the town arms and they re aollering themselves hoarse already ah said mr pickwick do they seem devoted to their party sam never see such dewotion in my life sir energetic eh said mr pickwick uncommon replied sam i never see men eat and drink so much afore i wonder they ain t afeer o bustin that s the mistaken kindness of the gentry here said mr pickwick wery likely replied sam briefly fine fresh hearty fellows they seem said mr pickwick glancing from the window wery fresh replied sam me and the two waiters at the peacock has been aumpin over the independent woters as supped there last night pumping over independent voters exclaimed mr pickwick yes said his attendant every man slept vere he fell down we dragged em out one by one this mornin and put em under the pump and they re in reg lar fine order now shillin a head the committee paid for that ere job can such things be exclaimed the astonished mr pickwick lord bless your heart sir said sam why where was you half baptised hat s nothin that ain t nothing said mr pickwick nothin at all sir replied his attendant the night afore the last day o the last election here the opposite party bribed the barmaid at the town arms to hocus the brandyndater of fourteen unpolled electors as was atoppin in the house what do you mean by hocussing brandyndater inquired mr pickwick puttin laud num in it replied sam blessed if she didn t send em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over they took one man up to the booth in a truck fast asleep by way of experiment but it was no go hey wouldn t poll him so they brought him back and put him to bed again strange practices these said mr pickwick half speaking to himself and half addressing sam not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own father at an election time in this wery place sir replied sam what was that inquired mr pickwick why he drove a coach down here once said sam lection time came on and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from london night afore he was going to drive up committee on t other side sends for him quietly and away he goes vith the messenger who shows him in arge room ots of gen n eaps of papers pens and ink and all that ere ah mr weller says the gen n in the chair glad to see you sir how are you wery well thank sir says my father i hope you re pretty middlin says he pretty well thank sir says the gen n sit down mr weller ray sit down sir so my father sits down and he and the gen n looks wery hard at each other you don t remember me said the gen n can t say i do says my father oh i know you says the gen n know you when you was a boy says he well i don t remember you says my father that s wery odd says the gen n wery says my father you must have a bad mem ry mr weller says the gen n well it is a wery bad un says my father i thought so says the gen n so then they pours him out a glass of wine and gammons him about his driving and gets him into a reg lar good humour and at last shoves a twentyound note into his hand it s a wery bad road between this and london says the gen n here and there it is a heavy road says my father specially near the canal i think says the gen n nasty bit that ere says my father well mr weller says the gen n you re a wery good whip and can do what you like with your horses we know we re all wery fond o you mr weller so in case you should have an accident when you re bringing these here woters down and should tip em over into the canal vithout hurtin of em this is for yourself says he gen n you re wery kind says my father and i drink your health in another glass of wine says he vich he did and then buttons up the money and bows himself out you wouldn t believe sir continued sam with a look of inexpressible impudence at his master that on the wery day as he came down with them woters his coach was upset on that ere wery spot and ev ry man on em was turned into the canal and got out again inquired mr pickwick hastily why replied sam very slowly i rather think one old gen n was missin i know his hat was found but i ain t quite certain whether his head was in it or not but what i look at is the hexraordinary and wonderful coincidence that arter what that gen n said my father s coach should be upset in that wery place and on that wery day it is no doubt a very extraordinary circumstance indeed said mr pickwick but brush my hat sam for i hear mr winkle calling me to breakfast with these words mr pickwick descended to the parlour where he found breakfast laid and the family already assembled the meal was hastily despatched each of the gentlemen s hats was decorated with an enormous blue favour made up by the fair hands of mrs pott herself and as mr winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a houseop in the immediate vicinity of the hustings mr pickwick and mr pott repaired alone to the town arms from the back window of which one of mr slumkey s committee was addressing six small boys and one girl whom he dignified at every second sentence with the imposing title of men of eatanswill whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously the stableard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength of the eatanswill blues there was a regular army of blue flags some with one handle and some with two exhibiting appropriate devices in golden characters four feet high and stout in proportion there was a grand band of trumpets bassoons and drums marshalled four abreast and earning their money if ever men did especially the drumeaters who were very muscular there were bodies of constables with blue staves twenty committeeen with blue scarfs and a mob of voters with blue cockades there were electors on horseback and electors afoot there was an open carriagendour for the honourable samuel slumkey and there were four carriagendair for his friends and supporters and the flags were rustling and the band was playing and the constables were swearing and the twenty committeeen were squabbling and the mob were shouting and the horses were backing and the post boys perspiring and everybody and everything then and there assembled was for the special use behoof honour and renown of the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of eatanswill in the commons house of parliament of the united kingdom loud and long were the cheers and mighty was the rustling of one of the blue flags with liberty of the press inscribed thereon when the sandy head of mr pott was discerned in one of the windows by the mob beneath and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the honourable samuel slumkey himself in topoots and a blue neckerchief advanced and seized the hand of the said pott and melodramatically testified by gestures to the crowd his ineffaceable obligations to the eatanswill gazette is everything ready said the honourable samuel slumkey to mr perker everything my dear sir was the little man s reply nothing has been omitted i hope said the honourable samuel slumkey nothing has been left undone my dear sir othing whatever there are twenty washed men at the street door for you to shake hands with and six children in arms that you re to pat on the head and inquire the age of be particular about the children my dear sir t has always a great effect that sort of thing i take care said the honourable samuel slumkey and perhaps my dear sir said the cautious little man perhaps if you could don t mean to say it s indispensable ut if you could manage to kiss one of em it would produce a very great impression on the crowd wouldn t it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did that said the honourable samuel slumkey why i am afraid it wouldn t replied the agent if it were done by yourself my dear sir i think it would make you very popular very well said the honourable samuel slumkey with a resigned air then it must be done that s all arrange the procession cried the twenty committeeen amidst the cheers of the assembled throng the band and the constables and the committeeen and the voters and the horsemen and the carriages took their places ach of the twoorse vehicles being closely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright in it and that assigned to mr perker containing mr pickwick mr tupman mr snodgrass and about half a dozen of the committee besides there was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the honourable samuel slumkey to step into his carriage suddenly the crowd set up a great cheering he has come out said little mr perker greatly excited the more so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward another cheer much louder he has shaken hands with the men cried the little agent another cheer far more vehement he has patted the babies on the head said mr perker trembling with anxiety a roar of applause that rent the air he has kissed one of em exclaimed the delighted little man a second roar he has kissed another gasped the excited manager a third roar he s kissing em all screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman and hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude the procession moved on how or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession and how it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon is more than we can undertake to describe inasmuch as mr pickwick s hat was knocked over his eyes nose and mouth by one poke of a buff flag staff very early in the proceedings he describes himself as being surrounded on every side when he could catch a glimpse of the scene by angry and ferocious countenances by a vast cloud of dust and by a dense crowd of combatants he represents himself as being forced from the carriage by some unseen power and being personally engaged in a pugilistic encounter but with whom or how or why he is wholly unable to state he then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind and on removing his hat found himself surrounded by his friends in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings the right was reserved for the buff party and the centre for the mayor and his officers one of whom he fat crier of eatanswill as ringing an enormous bell by way of commanding silence while mr horatio fizkin and the honourable samuel slumkey with their hands upon their hearts were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of heads that inundated the open space in front and from whence arose a storm of groans and shouts and yells and hootings that would have done honour to an earthquake there s winkle said mr tupman pulling his friend by the sleeve where said mr pickwick putting on his spectacles which he had fortunately kept in his pocket hitherto there said mr tupman on the top of that house and there sure enough in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof were mr winkle and mrs pott comfortably seated in a couple of chairs waving their handkerchiefs in token of recognition compliment which mr pickwick returned by kissing his hand to the lady the proceedings had not yet commenced and as an inactive crowd is generally disposed to be jocose this very innocent action was sufficient to awaken their facetiousness oh you wicked old rascal cried one voice looking arter the girls are you oh you wenerable sinner cried another putting on his spectacles to look at a married said a third i see him ainkin at her with his wicked old eye shouted a fourth look arter your wife pott bellowed a fifth nd then there was a roar of laughter as these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between mr pickwick and an aged ram and several witticisms of the like nature and as they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of an innocent lady mr pickwick s indignation was excessive but as silence was proclaimed at the moment he contented himself by scorching the mob with a look of pity for their misguided minds at which they laughed more boisterously than ever silence roared the mayor s attendants whiffin proclaim silence said the mayor with an air of pomp befitting his lofty station in obedience to this command the crier performed another concerto on the bell whereupon a gentleman in the crowd called out muffins which occasioned another laugh gentlemen said the mayor at as loud a pitch as he could possibly force his voice to gentlemen brother electors of the borough of eatanswill we are met here toay for the purpose of choosing a representative in the room of our late here the mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd sucess to the mayor cried the voice and may he never desert the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by this allusion to the professional pursuits of the orator was received with a storm of delight which with a bellccompaniment rendered the remainder of his speech inaudible with the exception of the concluding sentence in which he thanked the meeting for the patient attention with which they heard him throughout n expression of gratitude which elicited another burst of mirth of about a quarter of an hour s duration next a tall thin gentleman in a very stiff white neckerchief after being repeatedly desired by the crowd to send a boy home to ask whether he hadn t left his voice under the pillow begged to nominate a fit and proper person to represent them in parliament and when he said it was horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge near eatanswill the fizkinites applauded and the slumkeyites groaned so long and so loudly that both he and the seconder might have sung comic songs in lieu of speaking without anybody s being a bit the wiser the friends of horatio fizkin esquire having had their innings a little choleric pinkaced man stood forward to propose another fit and proper person to represent the electors of eatanswill in parliament and very swimmingly the pinkaced gentleman would have got on if he had not been rather too choleric to entertain a sufficient perception of the fun of the crowd but after a very few sentences of figurative eloquence the pinkaced gentleman got from denouncing those who interrupted him in the mob to exchanging defiances with the gentlemen on the hustings whereupon arose an uproar which reduced him to the necessity of expressing his feelings by serious pantomime which he did and then left the stage to his seconder who delivered a written speech of half an hour s length and wouldn t be stopped because he had sent it all to the eatanswill gazette and the eatanswill gazette had already printed it every word then horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge near eatanswill presented himself for the purpose of addressing the electors which he no sooner did than the band employed by the honourable samuel slumkey commenced performing with a power to which their strength in the morning was a trifle in return for which the buff crowd belaboured the heads and shoulders of the blue crowd on which the blue crowd endeavoured to dispossess themselves of their very unpleasant neighbours the buff crowd and a scene of struggling and pushing and fighting succeeded to which we can no more do justice than the mayor could although he issued imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders who might amount in number to two hundred and fifty or thereabouts at all these encounters horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge and his friends waxed fierce and furious until at last horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge begged to ask his opponent the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall whether that band played by his consent which question the honourable samuel slumkey declining to answer horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge shook his fist in the countenance of the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall upon which the honourable samuel slumkey his blood being up defied horatio fizkin esquire to mortal combat at this violation of all known rules and precedents of order the mayor commanded another fantasia on the bell and declared that he would bring before himself both horatio fizkin esquire of fizkin lodge and the honourable samuel slumkey of slumkey hall and bind them over to keep the peace upon this terrific denunciation the supporters of the two candidates interfered and after the friends of each party had quarrelled in pairs for threeuarters of an hour horatio fizkin esquire touched his hat to the honourable samuel slumkey the honourable samuel slumkey touched his to horatio fizkin esquire the band was stopped the crowd were partially quieted and horatio fizkin esquire was permitted to proceed
