i do not suppose that anyone who knows the name of allan quatermain would be likely to associate it with flowers and especially with orchids yet as it happens it was once my lot to take part in an orchid hunt of so remarkable a character that i think its details should not be lost at least i will set them down and if in the after days anyone cares to publish them well e is at liberty to do so it was in the year h never mind the year it was a long while ago when i was much younger that i went on a hunting expedition to the north of the limpopo river which borders the transvaal my companion was a gentleman of the name of scroope charles scroope he had come out to durban from england in search of sport at least that was one of his reasons the other was a lady whom i will call miss margaret manners though that was not her name it seems that these two were engaged to be married and really attached to each other unfortunately however they quarrelled violently about another gentlemen with whom miss manners danced four consecutive dances including two that were promised to her fianc at a hunt ball in essex where they all lived explanations or rather argument followed mr scroope said that he would not tolerate such conduct miss manners replied that she would not be dictated to she was her own mistress and meant to remain so mr scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he was concerned she answered that she never wished to see his face again he declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to africa to shoot elephants what is more he went starting from his essex home the next day without leaving any address as it transpired afterwards long afterwards had he waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that might have changed his plans but they were highpirited young people both of them and played the fool after the fashion of those in love well charles scroope turned up in durban which was but a poor place then and there we met in the bar of the royal hotel if you want to kill big game i heard some one say who it was i really forget there s the man to show you how to do it unter quatermain the best shot in africa and one of the finest fellows too i sat still smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing it is awkward to listen to oneself being praised and i was always a shy man then after a whispered colloquy mr scroope was brought forward and introduced to me i bowed as nicely as i could and ran my eye over him he was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect that was due to his love affai but i came to the conclusion that i liked the cut of his jib when he spoke that conclusion was affirmed i always think there is a great deal in a voice personally i judge by it almost as much as by the face this voice was particularly pleasant and sympathetic though there was nothing very original or striking in the words by which it was so to speak introduced to me these were how do you do sir will you have a split i answered that i never drank spirits in the daytime or at least not often but that i should be pleased to take a small bottle of beer when the beer was consumed we walked up together to my little house on which is now called the berea the same in which amongst others i received my friends curtis and good in after days and there we dined indeed charlie scroope never left that house until we started on our shooting expedition now i must cut all this story short since it is only incidentally that it has to do with the tale i am going to tell mr scroope was a rich man and as he offered to pay all the expenses of the expedition while i was to take all the profit in the shape of ivory or anything else that might accrue of course i did not decline his proposal everything went well with us on that trip until its unfortunate end we only killed two elephants but of other game we found plenty it was when we were near delagoa bay on our return that the accident happened we were out one evening trying to shoot something for our dinner when between the trees i caught sight of a small buck it vanished round a little promontory of rock which projected from the side of the kloof walking quietly not running in alarm we followed after it i was the first and had just wriggled round these rocks and perceived the buck standing about ten paces away it was a busho when i heard a rustle among the bushes on the top of the rock not a dozen feet above my head and charlie scroope s voice calling look out quatermain he s coming who s coming i answered in an irritated tone for the noise had made the buck run away then it occurred to me all in an instant of course that a man would not begin to shout like that for nothing at any rate when his supper was concerned so i glanced up above and behind me to this moment i can remember exactly what i saw there was the granite waterorn boulder or rather several boulders with ferns growing in their cracks of the maidenair tribe most of them but some had a silver sheen on the under side of their leaves on one of these leaves bending it down sat a large beetle with red wings and a black body engaged in rubbing its antenn with its front paws and above just appearing over the top of the rock was the head of an extremely fine leopard as i write to seem to perceive its square jowl outlined against the arc of the quiet evening sky with the saliva dropping from its lips this was the last thing which i did perceive for a little while since at that moment the leopard e call them tigers in south africa ropped upon my back and knocked me flat as a pancake i presume that it also had been stalking the buck and was angry at my appearance on the scene down i went luckily for me into a patch of mossy soil all up i said to myself for i felt the brute s weight upon my back pressing me down among the moss and what was worse its hot breath upon my neck as it dropped its jaws to bite me in the head then i heard the report of scroope s rifle followed by furious snarling from the leopard which evidently had been hit also it seemed to think that i had caused its injuries for it seized me by the shoulder i felt its teeth slip along my skin but happily they only fastened in the shooting coat of tough corduroy that i was wearing it began to shake me then let go to get a better grip now remembering that scroope only carried a light singlearrelled rifle and therefore could not fire again i knew or thought i knew that my time had come i was not exactly afraid but the sense of some great impending chance became very vivid i remembered ot my whole life but one or two odd little things connected with my infancy for instance i seemed to see myself seated on my mother s knee playing with a little jointed goldish which she wore upon her watchhain after this i muttered a word or two of supplication and i think lost consciousness if so it can only have been for a few seconds then my mind returned to me and i saw a strange sight the leopard and scroope were fighting each other the leopard standing on one hind leg for the other was broken seemed to be boxing scroope whilst scroope was driving his big hunting knife into the brute s carcase they went down scroope undermost the leopard tearing at him i gave a wriggle and came out of that mossy bed recall the sucking sound my body made as it left the close by was my rifle uninjured and at full cock as it had fallen from my hand i seized it and in another second had shot the leopard through the head just as it was about to seize scroope s throat it fell stone dead on the top of him one quiver one contraction of the claws in poor scroope s le and all was over there it lay as though it were asleep and underneath was scroope the difficulty was to get it off him for the beast was very heavy but i managed this at last with the help of a thorn bough i found which some elephant had torn from a tree this i used as a lever there beneath lay scroope literally covered with blood though whether his own or the leopard s i could not tell at first i thought that he was dead but after i had poured some water over him from the little stream that trickled down the rock he sat up and asked inconsequently what am i now a hero i answered i have always been proud of that repartee then discouraging further conversation i set to work to get him back to the camp which fortunately was close at hand when we had proceeded a couple of hundred yards he still making inconsequent remarks his right arm round my neck and my left arm round his middle suddenly he collapsed in a dead faint and as his weight was more than i could carry i had to leave him and fetch help in the end i got him to the tents by aid of the kaffirs and a blanket and there made an examination he was scratched all over but the only serious wounds were a bite through the muscles of the left upper arm and three deep cuts in the right thigh just where it joins the body caused by a stroke of the leopard s claws i gave him a dose of laudanum to send him to sleep and dressed these hurts as best i could for three days he went on quite well indeed the wounds had begun to heal healthily when suddenly some kind of fever took him caused i suppose by the poison of the leopard s fangs or claws oh what a terrible week was that which followed he became delirious raving continually of all sorts of things and especially of miss margaret manners i kept up his strength as well as was possible with soup made from the flesh of game mixed with a little brandy which i had but he grew weaker and weaker also the wounds in the thigh began to suppurate the kaffirs whom we had with us were of little use in such a case so that all the nursing fell on me luckily beyond a shaking the leopard had done me no hurt and i was very strong in those days still the lack of rest told on me since i dared not sleep for more than half an hour or so at a time at length came a morning when i was quite worn out there lay poor scroope turning and muttering in the little tent and there i sat by his side wondering whether he would live to see another dawn or if he did for how long i should be able to tend him i called to a kaffir to bring me my coffee and just was i was lifting the pannikin to my lips with a shaking hand help came it arrived in a very strange shape in front of our camp were two thorn trees and from between these trees the rays from the rising sun falling full on him i saw a curious figure walking towards me in a slow purposeful fashion it was that of a man of uncertain age for though the beard and long hair were white the face was comparatively youthful save for the wrinkles round the mouth and the dark eyes were full of life and vigour tattered garments surmounted by a torn kaross or skin rug hung awkwardly upon his tall thin frame on his feet were veldchoen of untanned hide on his back a battered tin case was strapped and in his bony nervous hand he clasped a long staff made of the black and white wood the natives call unzimbiti on the top of which was fixed a butterfly net behind him were some kaffirs who carried cases on their heads i knew him at once since we had met before especially on a certain occasion in zululand when he calmly appeared out of the ranks of a hostile native impi he was one of the strangest characters in all south africa evidently a gentleman in the true sense of the word none knew his history although i know it now and a strange story it i except that he was an american by birth for in this matter at times his speech betrayed him also he was a doctor by profession and to judge from his extraordinary skill one who must have seen much practice both in medicine and in surgery for the rest he had means though where they came from was a mystery and for many years past had wandered about south and eastern africa collecting butterflies and flowers by the natives and i might add by white people also he was universally supposed to be mad this reputation coupled with his medical skill enabled him to travel wherever he would without the slightest fear of molestation since the kaffirs look upon the mad as inspired by god their name for him was dogeetah a ludicrous corruption of the english word doctor whereas white folk called him indifferently brother john uncle jonathan or saint john the second appellation he got from his extraordinary likeness when cleaned up and nicely dresse to the figure by which the great american nation is typified in comic papers as england is typified by john bull the first and third arose in the wellnown goodness of his character and a taste he was supposed to possess for living on locusts and wild honey or their local equivalents personally however he preferred to be addressed as brother john oh who can tell the relief with which i saw him an angel from heaven could scarcely have been more welcome as he came i poured out a second jorum of coffee and remembering that he liked it sweet put in plenty of sugar how do you do brother john i said proffering him the coffee greeting brother allan he answered n those days he affected a kind of old roman way of speaking as i imagine it then he took the coffee put his long finger into it to test the temperature and stir up the sugar drank it off as though it were a dose of medicine and handed back the tin to be refilled bugunting i queried he nodded that and flowers and observing human nature and the wonderful works of god wandering around generally where from last i asked those hills nearly twenty miles away left them at eight in the evening walked all night why i said looking at him because it seemed as though someone were calling me to be plain you allan oh you heard about my being here and the trouble no heard nothing meant to strike out for the coast this morning just as i was turning in at exactly got your message and started that s all my message i began then stopped and asking to see his watch compared it with mine oddly enough they showed the same time to within two minutes it is a strange thing i said slowly but at last night i did try to send a message for some help because i thought my mate was dying and i jerked my thumb towards the tent only it wasn t to you or any other man brother john understand quite message was expressed on that s all expressed and i guess registered as well i looked at brother john and brother john looked at me but at the time we made no further remark the thing was too curious that is unless he lied but nobody had ever known him to lie he was a truthful person painfully truthful at times and yet there are people who do not believe in prayer what is it he asked mauled by leopard wounds won t heal and fever i don t think he can last long what do you know about it let me see him well he saw him and did wonderful things that tin box of his was full of medicines and surgical instruments which latter he boiled before he used them also he washed his hands till i thought the skin would come off them using up more soap than i could spare first he gave poor charlie a dose of something that seemed to kill him he said he had that drug from the kaffirs then he opened up those wounds upon his thigh and cleaned them out and bandaged them with boiled herbs afterwards when scroope came to again he gave him a drink that threw him into a sweat and took away the fever the end of it was that in two days time his patient sat up and asked for a square meal and in a week we were able to begin to carry him to the coast guess that message of yours saved brother scroope s life said old john as he watched him start i made no answer here i may state however that through my own men i inquired a little as to brother john s movements at the time of what he called the message it seemed that he had arranged to march towards the coast on the next morning but that about two hours after sunset suddenly he ordered them to pack up everything and follow him this they did and to their intense disgust those kaffirs were forced to trudge all night at the heels of dogeetah as they called him indeed so weary did they become that had they not been afraid of being left alone in an unknown country in the darkness they said they would have thrown down their loads and refused to go any further that is as far as i was able to take the matter which may be explained by telepathy inspiration instinct or coincidence it is one as to which the reader must form his own opinion during our week together in camp and our subsequent journey to delagoa bay and thence by ship to durban brother john and i grew very intimate with limitations of his past as i have said he never talked or of the real object of his wanderings which i learned afterwards but of his natural history and ethnological i believe that is the wor studies he spoke a good deal as in my humble way i also am an observer of such matters and know something about african natives and their habits from practical experience these subjects interested me amongst other things he showed me many of the specimens that he had collected during his recent journey insects and beautiful butterflies neatly pinned into boxes also a quantity of dried flowers pressed between sheets of blotting paper amongst them some which he told me were orchids observing that these attracted me he asked me if i would like to see the most wonderful orchid in the whole world of course i said yes whereon he produced out of one of his cases a flat package about two feet six square he undid the grass mats in which it was wrapped striped delicately woven mats such as they make in the neighbourhood of zanzibar within these was the lid of a packingase then came more mats and some copies of the cape journal spread out flat then sheets of blotting paper and last of all between two pieces of cardboard a flower and one leaf of the plant on which it grew even in its dried state it was a wondrous thing measuring twentyour inches from the tip of one wing or petal to the tip of the other by twenty inches from the top of the back sheath to the bottom of the pouch the measurement of the back sheath itself i forget but it must have been quite a foot across in colour it was or had been bright golden but the back sheath was white barred with lines of black and in the exact centre of the pouch was a single black spot shaped like the head of a great ape there were the overhanging brows the deep recessed eyes the surly mouth the massive jaws verything although at that time i had never seen a gorilla in the flesh i had seen a coloured picture of the brute and if that picture had been photographed on the flower the likeness could not have been more perfect what is it i asked amazed sir said brother john sometimes he used this formal term when excited it is the most marvellous cypripedium in the whole earth and sir i have discovered it a healthy root of that plant will be worth that s better than gold mining i said well have you got the root brother john shook his head sadly as he answered no such luck how s that as you have the flower i tell you allan for a year past and more i have been collecting in the district back of kilwa and found some wonderful things yes wonderful at last about three hundred miles inland i came to a tribe or rather a people that no white man had ever visited they are called the mazitu a numerous and warlike people of bastard zulu blood i have heard of them i interrupted they broke north before the days of senzangakona two hundred years or more ago well i could make myself understood among them because they still talk a corrupt zulu as do all the tribes in those parts at first they wanted to kill me but let me go because they thought that i was mad everyone thinks that i am mad allan it is a kind of public delusion whereas i think that i am sane and that most other people are mad a private delusion i suggested hurriedly as i did not wish to discuss brother john s sanity well go on about the mazitu later they discovered that i had skill in medicine and their king bausi came to me to be treated for a great external tumour i risked an operation and cured him it was anxious work for if he had died i should have died too though that would not have troubled me very much and he sighed of course from that moment i was supposed to be a great magician also bausi made a blood brotherhood with me transfusing some of his blood into my veins and some of mine into his i only hope he has not inoculated me with his tumours which are congenital so i became bausi and bausi became me in other words i was as much chief of the mazitu as he was and shall remain so all my life that might be useful i said reflectively but go on i learned that on the western boundary of the mazitu territory were great swamps that beyond these swamps was a lake called kirua and beyond that a large and fertile land supposed to be an island with a mountain in its centre this land is known as pongo and so are the people who live there that is a native name for the gorilla isn t it i asked at least so a fellow who had been on the west coast told me indeed then that s strange as you will see now these pongo are supposed to be great magicians and the god they worship is said to be a gorilla which if you are right accounts for their name or rather he went on they have two gods the other is that flower you see there whether the flower with the monkey s head on it was the first god and suggested the worship of the beast itself or vice versa i don t know indeed i know very little just what i was told by the mazitu and a man who called himself a pongo chief no more what did they say the mazitu said that the pongo people are devils who came by the secret channels through the reeds in canoes and stole their children and women whom they sacrificed to their gods sometimes too they made raids upon them at night howling like hyenas the men they killed and the women and children they took away the mazitu want to attack them but cannot do so because they are not water people and have no canoes and therefore are unable to reach the island if it is an island also they told me about the wonderful flower which grows in the place where the apeod lives and is worshipped like the god they had the story of it from some of their people who had been enslaved and escaped did you try to get to the island i asked yes allan that is i went to the edge of the reeds which lie at the end of a long slope of plain where the lake begins here i stopped for some time catching butterflies and collecting plants one night when i was camped there by myself for none of my men would remain so near the pongo country after sunset i woke up with a sense that i was no longer alone i crept out of my tent and by the light of the moon which was setting for dawn drew near i saw a man who leant upon the handle of a very wideladed spear which was taller than himself a big man over six feet two high i should say and broad in proportion he wore a long white cloak reaching from his shoulders almost to the ground on his head was a tightitting cap with lappets also white in his ears were rings of copper or gold and on his wrists bracelets of the same metal his skin was intensely black but the features were not at all negroid they were prominent and finelyut the nose being sharp and the lips quite thin indeed of an arab type his left hand was bandaged and on his face was an expression of great anxiety lastly he appeared to be about fifty years of age so still did he stand that i began to wonder whether he were one of those ghosts which the mazitu swore the pongo wizards send out to haunt their country for a long while we stared at each other for i was determined that i would not speak first or show any concern at last he spoke in a low deep voice and in mazitu or a language so similar that i found it easy to understand is not your name dogeetah o white lord and are you not a master of medicine yes i answered but who are you who dare to wake me from my sleep lord i am the kalubi the chief of the pongo a great man in my own land yonder then why do you come here alone at night kalubi chief of the pongo why do you come here alone white lord he answered evasively what do you want anyway i asked o dogeetah i have been hurt i want you to cure me and he looked at his bandaged hand lay down that spear and open your robe that i may see you have no knife he obeyed throwing the spear to some distance now unwrap the hand he did so i lit a match the sight of which seemed to frighten him greatly although he asked no questions about it and by its light examined the hand the first joint of the second finger was gone from the appearance of the stump which had been cauterized and was tied tightly with a piece of flexible grass i judged that it had been bitten off what did this i asked monkey he answered poisonous monkey cut off the finger o dogeetah or tomorrow i die why do you not tell your own doctors to cut off the finger you who are kalubi chief of the pongo no no he replied shaking his head they cannot do it it is not lawful and i i cannot do it for if the flesh is black the hand must come off too and if the flesh is black at the wrist then the arm must be cut off i sat down on my camp stool and reflected really i was waiting for the sun to rise since it was useless to attempt an operation in that light the man kalubi thought that i had refused his petition and became terribly agitated be merciful white lord he prayed do not let me die i am afraid to die life is bad but death is worse o if you refuse me i will kill myself here before you and then my ghost will haunt you till you die also of fear and come to join me what fee do you ask gold or ivory or slaves say and i will give it be silent i said for i saw that if he went on thus he would throw himself into a fever which might cause the operation to prove fatal for the same reason i did not question him about many things i should have liked to learn i lit my fire and boiled the instruments e thought i was making magic by the time that everything was ready the sun was up now i said let me see how brave you are well allan i performed that operation removing the finger at the base where it joins the hand as i thought there might be something in his story of the poison indeed as i found afterwards on dissection and can show you for i have the thing in spirits there was for the blackness of which he spoke a kind of mortification i presume had crept almost to the joint though the flesh beyond was healthy enough certainly that kalubi was a plucky fellow he sat like a rock and never even winced indeed when he saw that the flesh was sound he uttered a great sigh of relief after it was all over he turned a little faint so i gave him some spirits of wine mixed with water which revived him o lord dogeetah he said as i was bandaging his hand while i live i am your slave yet do me one more service in my land there is a terrible wild beast that which bit off my finger it is a devil it kills us and we fear it i have heard that you white men have magic weapons which slay with a noise come to my land and kill me that wild beast with your magic weapon i say come come for i am terribly afraid and indeed he looked it no i answered i shed no blood i kill nothing except butterflies and of these only a few but if you fear this brute why do you not poison it you black people have many drugs no use no use he replied in a kind of wail the beast knows poisons some it swallows and they do not harm it others it will not touch moreover no black man can do it hurt it is white and it has been known from of old that if it dies at all it must be by the hand of one who is white a very strange animal i began suspiciously for i felt sure that he was lying to me but just at that moment i heard the sound of my men s voices they were advancing towards me through the giant grass singing as they came but as yet a long way off the kalubi heard it also and sprang up i must be gone he said none must see me here what fee o lord of medicine what fee i take no payment for my medicine i said yet tay a wonderful flower grows in your country does it not a flower with wings and a cup beneath i would have that flower who told you of the flower he asked the flower is holy still o white lord still for you it shall be risked oh return and bring with you one who can kill the beast and i will make you rich return and call to the reeds for the kalubi and the kalubi will hear and come to you then he ran to his spear snatched it from the ground and vanished among the reeds that was the last i saw or am ever likely to see of him but brother john you got the flower somehow yes allan about a week later when i came out of my tent one morning there it was standing in a narrowouthed earthenware pot filled with water of course i meant that he was to send me the plant roots and all but i suppose he understood that i wanted a bloom or perhaps he dared not send the plant anyhow it is better than nothing why did you not go into the country and get it for yourself for several reasons allan of which the best is that it was impossible the mazitu swear that if anyone sees that flower he is put to death indeed when they found that i had a bloom of it they forced me to move to the other side of the country seventy miles away so i thought that i would wait till i met with some companions who would accompany me indeed to be frank allan it occurred to me that you were the sort of man who would like to interview this wonderful beast that bites off people s fingers and frightens them to death and brother john stroked his long white beard and smiled adding odd that we should have met so soon afterwards isn t it did you i replied now did you indeed brother john people say all sorts of things about you but i have come to the conclusion that there s nothing the matter with your wits again he smiled and stroked his long white beard chapter the auction room i do not think that this conversion about the pongo savages who were said to worship a gorilla and a golden flower was renewed until we reached my house at durban thither of course i took mr charles scroope and thither also came brother john who as bedroom accommodation was lacking pitched his tent in the garden one night we sat on the step smoking brother john s only concession to human weakness was that he smoked he drank no wine or spirits he never ate meat unless he was obliged but i rejoice to say that he smoked cigars like most americans when he could get them john said i i have been thinking over that yarn of yours and have come to one or two conclusions what may they be allan the first is that you were a great donkey not to get more out of the kalubi when you had the chance agreed allan but amongst other things i am a doctor and the operation was uppermost in my mind the second is that i believe this kalubi had charge of the gorillaod as no doubt you ve guessed also that it was the gorilla which bit off his finger why so because i have heard of great monkeys called sokos that live in central east africa which are said to bite off men s toes and fingers i have heard too that they are very like gorillas now you mention it so have i allan indeed once i saw a soko though some way off a huge brown ape which stood on its hind legs and drummed upon its chest with its fists i didn t see it for long because i ran away the third is that this yellow orchid would be worth a great deal of money if one could dig it up and take it to england i think i told you allan that i valued it at so that conclusion of yours is not original the fourth is that i should like to dig up that orchid and get a share of the brother john became intensely interested ah he said now we are getting to the point i have been wondering how long it would take you to see it allan but if you are slow you are sure the fifth is i went on that such an expedition to succeed would need a great deal of money more than you or i could find partners would be wanted active or sleeping but partners with cash brother john looked towards the window of the room in which charlie scroope was in bed for being still weak he went to rest early no i said he s had enough of africa and you told me yourself that it will be two years before he is really strong again also there s a lady in this case now listen i have taken it on myself to write to that lady whose address i found out while he didn t know what he was saying i have said that he was dying but that i hoped he might live meanwhile i added i thought she would like to know that he did nothing but rave of her also that he was a hero with a big h twice underlined my word i did lay it on about the hero business with a spoon a real hotel gravy spoon if charlie scroope knows himself again when he sees my description of him well i a dutchman that s all the letter caught the last mail and will i hope reach the lady in due course now listen again scroope wants me to go to england with him to look after him on the voyage hat s what he says what he means is that he hopes i might put in a word for him with the lady if i should chance to be introduced to her he offers to pay all my expenses and to give me something for my loss of time so as i haven t seen england since i was three years old i think i take the chance brother john s face fell then how about the expedition allan he asked this is the first of november i answered and the wet season in those parts begins about now and lasts till april so it would be no use trying to visit your pongo friends till then which gives me plenty of time to go to england and come out again if you trust that flower to me i take it with me perhaps i might be able to find someone who would be willing to put down money on the chance of getting the plant on which it grew meanwhile you are welcome to this house if you care to stay here thank you allan but i can t sit still for so many months i go somewhere and come back he paused and a dreamy look came into his dark eyes then went on you see brother it is laid on me to wander and wander through all this great land until know until you know what i asked sharply he pulled himself together with a jerk as it were and answered with a kind of forced carelessness until i know every inch of it of course there are lots of tribes i have not yet visited including the pongo i said by the way if i can get the money together for a trip up there i suppose you mean to come too don t you if not the thing s off so far as i am concerned you see i am reckoning on you to get us through the mazitu and into pongoand by the help of your friends certainly i mean to come in fact if you don t go i shall start alone i intend to explore pongoand even if i never come out of it again once more i looked at him as i answered you are ready to risk a great deal for a flower john or are you looking for more than a flower if so i hope you will tell me the truth this i said as i was aware that brother john had a foolish objection to uttering or even acting lies well allan as you put it like that the truth is that i heard something more about the pongo than i told you up country it was after i had operated on that kalubi or i would have tried to get in alone but this i could not do then as i have said and what did you hear i heard that they had a white goddess as well as a white god well what of it a female gorilla i suppose nothing except that goddesses have always interested me good night you are an odd old fish i remarked after him and what is more you have got something up your sleeve well i have it down one day meanwhile i wonder whether the whole thing is a lie no not a lie an hallucination it can t be ecause of that orchid no one can explain away the orchid a queer people these pongo with their white god and goddess and their holy flower but after all africa is a land of queer people and of queer gods too and now the story shifts away to england don t be afraid my adventurous reader if ever i have one it is coming back to africa again in a very few pages mr charles scroope and i left durban a day or two after my last conversation with brother john at cape town we caught the mail a wretched little boat you would think it now which after a long and wearisome journey at length landed us safe at plymouth our companions on that voyage were very dull i have forgotten most of them but one lady i do remember i imagine that she must have commenced life as a barmaid for she had the orthodox tow hair and blowsy appearance at any rate she was the wife of a wineerchant who had made a fortune at the cape unhappily however she had contracted too great a liking for her husband s wares and after dinner was apt to become talkative for some reason or other she took a particular aversion to me oh i can see her now seated in that saloon with the oil lamp swinging over her head she always chose the position under the oil lamp because it showed off her diamond and i can hear her too don t bring any of your elephantunting manners here mr allan with an emphasis on the alla quatermain they are not fit for polite society you should go and brush your hair mr quatermain i may explain that my hair sticks up naturally then would come her little husband s horrified hush hush you are quite insulting my dear oh why do i remember it all after so many years when i have even forgotten the people s names one of those little things that stick in the mind i suppose the island of ascension where we called sticks also with its long swinging rollers breaking in white foam its bare mountain peak capped with green and the turtles in the ponds those poor turtles we brought two of them home and i used to look at them lying on their backs in the forecastle flapping their fins feebly one of them died and i got the butcher to save me the shell afterwards i gave it as a wedding present to mr and mrs scroope nicely polished and lined i meant it for a workasket and was overwhelmed with confusion when some silly lady said at the marriage and in the hearing of the bride and bridegroom that it was the most beautiful cradle she had ever seen of course like a fool i tried to explain whereon everybody tittered but why do i write of such trifles that have nothing to do with my story i mentioned that i had ventured to send a letter to miss margaret manners about mr charles scroope in which i said incidentally that if the hero should happen to live i should probably bring him home by the next mail well we got into plymouth about eight o clock in the morning on a mild november day and shortly afterwards a tug arrived to take off the passengers and mails also some cargo i being an early riser watched it come and saw upon the deck a stout lady wrapped in furs and by her side a very pretty fairaired young woman clad in a neat serge dress and a porkie hat presently a steward told me that someone wished to speak to me in the saloon i went and found these two standing side by side i believe you are mr allan quatermain said the stout lady where is mr scroope whom i understand you have brought home tell me at once something about her appearance and fierce manner of address alarmed me so much that i could only answer feebly below madam below there my dear said the stout lady to her companion i warned you to be prepared for the worst bear up do not make a scene before all these people the ways of providence are just and inscrutable it is your own temper that was to blame you should never have sent the poor man off to these heathen countries then turning to me she added sharply i suppose he is embalmed we should like to bury him in essex embalmed i gasped embalmed why the man is in his bath or was a few minutes ago in another second that pretty young lady who had been addressed was weeping with her head upon my shoulder margaret exclaimed her companion she was a kind of heavy aun i told you not to make a scene in public mr quatermain as mr scroope is alive would you ask him to be so good as to come here well i fetched him halfhaved and the rest of the business may be imagined it is a very fine thing to be a hero with a big h henceforth thanks to that was charlie scroope s lot in life he has grandchildren now and they all think him a hero what is more he does not contradict them i went down to the lady s place in essex a fine property with a beautiful old house on the night i arrived there was a dinnerarty of twentyour people i had to make a speech about charlie scroope and the leopard i think it was a good speech at any rate everybody cheered including the servants who had gathered at the back of the big hall i remember that to complete the story i introduced several other leopards a mother and two threeartrown cubs also a wounded buffalo and told how mr scroope finished them off one after the other with a hunting knife the thing was to watch his face as the history proceeded luckily he was sitting next to me and i could kick him under the table it was all very amusing and very happy also for these two really loved each other thank god that i or rather brother john was able to bring them together again it was during that stay of mine in essex by the way that i first met lord ragnall and the beautiful miss holmes with whom i was destined to experience some very strange adventures in the after years after this interlude i got to work someone told me that there was a firm in the city that made a business of selling orchids by auction flowers which at this time were beginning to be very fashionable among rich horticulturists this thought i would be the place for me to show my treasure doubtless messrs may and primrose hat was their worldamed style ould be able to put me in touch with opulent orchidists who would not mind venturing a couple of thousands on the chance of receiving a share in a flower that according to brother john should be worth untold gold at any rate i would try so on a certain friday about halfast twelve i sought out the place of business of messrs may and primrose bearing with me the golden cypripedium which was now enclosed in a flat tin case as it happened i chose an unlucky day and hour for on arriving at the office and asking for mr may i was informed that he was away in the country valuing then i would like to see mr primrose i said mr primrose is round at the rooms selling replied the clerk who appeared to be very busy where are the rooms i asked out of the door turn to the left turn to the left again and under the clock said the clerk and closed the shutter so disgusted was i with his rudeness that i nearly gave up the enterprise thinking better of it however i followed the directions given and in a minute or two found myself in a narrow passage that led to a large room to one who had never seen anything of the sort before this room offered a curious sight the first thing i observed was a notice on the wall to the effect that customers were not allowed to smoke pipes i thought to myself that orchids must be curious flowers if they could distinguish between the smoke of a cigar and a pipe and stepped into the room to my left was a long table covered with pots of the most beautiful flowers that i had ever seen all of them orchids along the wall and opposite were other tables closely packed with withered roots which i concluded were also those of orchids to my inexperienced eye the whole lot did not look worth five shillings for they seemed to be dead at the head of the room stood the rostrum where sat a gentleman with an extremely charming face he was engaged in selling by auction so rapidly that the clerk at his side must have had difficulty in keeping a record of the lots and their purchasers in front of him was a horseshoe table round which sat buyers the end of this table was left unoccupied so that the porters might exhibit each lot before it was put up for sale standing under the rostrum was yet another table a small one upon which were about twenty pots of flowers even more wonderful than those on the large table a notice stated that these would be sold at onehirty precisely all about the room stood knots of men such ladies as were present sat at the tabl many of whom had lovely orchids in their buttonholes these i found out afterwards were dealers and amateurs they were a kindlyaced set of people and i took a liking to them the whole place was quaint and pleasant especially by contrast with the horrible london fog outside squeezing my small person into a corner where i was in nobody s way i watched the proceedings for a while suddenly an agreeable voice at my side asked me if i would like a look at the catalogue i glanced at the speaker and in a sense fell in love with him at once s i have explained before i am one of those to whom a first impression means a great deal he was not very tall though strongooking and wellade enough he was not very handsome though none so illavoured he was just an ordinary fair young englishman four or fivendwenty years of age with merry blue eyes and one of the pleasantest expressions that i ever saw at once i felt that he was a sympathetic soul and full of the milk of human kindness he was dressed in a rough tweed suit rather worn with the orchid that seemed to be the badge of all this tribe in his buttonhole somehow the costume suited his rather pink and white complexion and rumpled fair hair which i could see as he was sitting on his cloth hat thank you no i answered i did not come here to buy i know nothing about orchids i added by way of explanation except a few i have seen growing in africa and this one and i tapped the tin case which i held under my arm indeed he said i should like to hear about the african orchids what is it you have in the case a plant or flowers one flower only it is not mine a friend in africa asked me to ell that is a long story which might not interest you i not sure i suppose it must be a cymbidium scape from the size i shook my head that s not the name my friend mentioned he called it a cypripedium the young man began to grow curious one cypripedium in all that large case it must be a big flower yes my friend said it is the biggest ever found it measures twentyour inches across the wings petals i think he called them and about a foot across the back part twentyour inches across the petals and a foot across the dorsal sepal said the young man in a kind of gasp and a cypripedium sir surely you are joking sir i answered indignantly i am doing nothing of the sort your remark is tantamount to telling me that i am speaking a falsehood but of course for all i know the thing may be some other kind of flower let me see it in the name of the goddess flora let me see it i began to undo the case indeed it was already halfpen when two other gentlemen who had either overheard some of our conversation or noted my companion s excited look edged up to us i observed that they also wore orchids in their buttonholes hullo somers said one of them in a tone of false geniality what have you got there what has your friend got there asked the other nothing replied the young man who had been addressed as somers nothing at all that is nly a case of tropical butterflies oh butterflies said no and sauntered away but no a keenooking person with the eye of a hawk was not so easily satisfied let us see these butterflies he said to me you can t ejaculated the young man my friend is afraid lest the damp should injure their colours ain t you brown yes i am somers i replied taking his cue and shutting the tin case with a snap then the hawkyed person departed also grumbling for that story about the damp stuck in his throat orchidist whispered the young man dreadful people orchidists so jealous very rich too both of them mr brown hope that is your name though i admit the chances are against it they are i replied my name is allan quatermain ah much better than brown well mr allan quatermain there s a private room in this place to which i have admittance would you mind coming with that here the hawkyed gentleman strolled past again that case of butterflies with pleasure i answered and followed him out of the auction chamber down some steps through the door to the left and ultimately into a little cupboardike room lined with shelves full of books and ledgers he closed the door and locked it now he said in a tone of the villain in a novel who at last has come face to face with the virtuous heroine now we are alone mr quatermain let me see hose butterflies i placed the case on a deal table which stood under a skylight in the room i opened it i removed the cover of wadding and there pressed between two sheets of glass and quite uninjured after all its journeyings appeared the golden flower glorious even in death and by its side the broad green leaf the young gentleman called somers looked at it till i thought his eyes would really start out of his head he turned away muttering something and looked again oh heavens he said at last oh heavens is it possible that such a thing can exist in this imperfect world you haven t faked it mr half mean quatermain have you sir i said for the second time you are making insinuations good morning and i began to shut up the case don t be offhanded he exclaimed pity the weaknesses of a poor sinner you don t understand if only you understood you would understand no i said i am bothered if i do well you will when you begin to collect orchids i not mad really except perhaps on this point mr quatermain his in a low and thrilling voice that marvellous cypripedium our friend is right it is a cypripedium s worth a gold mine from my experience of gold mines i can well believe that i said tartly and i may add prophetically oh i mean a gold mine in the figurative and colloquial sense not as the investor knows it he answered that is the plant on which it grew is priceless where is the plant mr quatermain in a rather indefinite locality in africa east by south i replied i can t place it to within three hundred miles that s vague mr quatermain i have no right to ask it seeing that you know nothing of me but i assure you i am respectable and in short would you mind telling me the story of this flower i don t think i should i replied a little doubtfully then after another good look at him suppressing all names and exact localities i gave him the outline of the tale explaining that i wanted to find someone who would finance an expedition to the remote and romantic spot where this particular cypripedium was believed to grow just as i finished my narrative and before he had time to comment on it there came a violent knocking at the door mr stephen said a voice are you there mr stephen by jove that s briggs exclaimed the young man briggs is my father s manager shut up the case mr quatermain come in briggs he went on unlocking the door slowly what is it it is a good deal replied a thin and agitated person who thrust himself through the opening door your father i mean sir alexander has come to the office unexpectedly and is in a nice taking because he didn t find you there sir when he discovered that you had gone to the orchid sale he grew furious sir furious and sent me to fetch you did he replied mr somers in an easy and unruffled tone well tell sir alexander i am coming at once now please go briggs and tell him i am coming at once briggs departed not too willingly i must leave you mr quatermain said mr somers as he shut the door behind him but will you promise me not to show that flower to anyone until i return i be back within half an hour yes mr somers i wait half an hour for you in the sale room and i promise that no one shall see that flower till you return thank you you are a good fellow and i promise you shall lose nothing by your kindness if i can help it we went together into the sale room where some thought suddenly struck mr somers by jove he said i nearly forgot about that odontoglossum where s woodden oh come here woodden i want to speak to you the person called woodden obeyed he was a man of about fifty indefinite in colouring for his eyes were very lightlue or grey and his hair was sandy toughooking and strongly made with big hands that showed signs of work for the palms were horny and the nails worn down he was clad in a suit of shiny black such as folk of the labouring class wear at a funeral i made up my mind at once that he was a gardener woodden said mr somers this gentleman here has got the most wonderful orchid in the whole world keep your eye on him and see that he isn t robbed there are people in this room mr quatermain who would murder you and throw your body into the thames for that flower he added darkly on receipt of this information woodden rocked a little on his feet as though he felt the premonitory movements of an earthquake it was a habit of his whenever anything astonished him then fixing his pale eye upon me in a way which showed that my appearance surprised him he pulled a lock of his sandy hair with his thumb and finger and said servant sir and where might this horchid be i pointed to the tin case yes it s there went on mr somers and that s what you ve got to watch mr quatermain if anyone attempts to rob you call for woodden and he will knock them down he s my gardener you know and entirely to be trusted especially if it is a matter of knocking anyone down aye i knock him down surely said woodden doubling his great fist and looking round him with a suspicious eye now listen woodden have you looked at that odontoglossum pavo and if so what do you think of it and he nodded towards a plant which stood in the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table beneath the auctioneer s desk it bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers on the top petal if it is a peta and also on the lip of each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the iridescent eye on the tail feathers of a peacock whence i suppose the flower was named pavo or peacock yes master and i think it the beautifullest thing that ever i saw there isn t a glossum in england like that there glossum paving he added with conviction and rocked again as he said the word but there s plenty after it i say they re amelling round that blossom like like awgs round a rat hole and this triumphantl they don t do that for nothing quite so woodden you have got a logical mind but look here we must have that pavo whatever it costs now the governor has sent for me i be back presently but i might be detained if so you ve got to bid on my behalf for i daren t trust any of these agents here s your authority and he scribbled on a card woodden my gardener has directions to bid for me s now woodden he went on when he had given the card to an attendant who passed it up to the auctioneer don t you make a fool of yourself and let that pavo slip through your fingers in another instant he was gone what did the master say sir asked woodden of me that i was to get that there paving whatever it cost yes i said that s what he said i suppose it will fetch a good deal everal pounds maybe sir can t tell all i know is that i ve got to buy it as you can bear me witness master he ain t one to be crossed for money what he wants he have that is if it be in the orchid line i suppose you are fond of orchids too mr woodden fond of them sir why i loves em here he rocked don t feel for nothing else in the same way not even for my old woman then with a burst of enthusias no not even for the master himself and i fond enough of him god knows but begging your pardon sir with a pull at his foreloc would you mind holding that tin of yours a little tighter i ve got to keep an eye on that as well as on o paving and i just see that chap with the tall hat alooking at it suspicious after this we separated i retired into my corner while woodden took his stand by the table with one eye fixed on what he called the o paving and the other on me and my tin case an odd fish truly i thought to myself positive the old woman comparative his master superlative the orchid tribe those were his degrees of affection honest and brave and a good fellow though i bet the sale languished there were so many lots of one particular sort of dried orchid that buyers could not be found for them at a reasonable price and many had to be bought in at length the genial mr primrose in the rostrum addressed the audience gentlemen he said i quite understand that you didn t come here toay to buy a rather poor lot of cattleya mossi you came to buy or to bid for or to see sold the most wonderful odontoglossum that has ever been flowered in this country the property of a famous firm of importers whom i congratulate upon their good fortune in having obtained such a gem gentlemen this miraculous flower ought to adorn a royal greenhouse but there it is to be taken away by whoever will pay the most for it for i am directed to see that it will be sold without reserve now i think he added running his eye over the company that most of our great collectors are represented in this room toay it is true that i do not see that spirited and liberal young orchidist mr somers but he has left his worthy headardener mr woodden than whom there is no finer judge of an orchid in england here woodden rocked violentl to bid for him as i hope for the glorious flower of which i have been speaking now as it is exactly halfast one we will proceed to business smith hand the odontoglossum pavo round that everyone may inspect its beauties and be careful you don t let it fall gentlemen i must ask you not to touch it or to defile its purity with tobacco smoke eight perfect flowers in bloom gentlemen and four o five more to open a strong plant in perfect health six pseudoulbs with leaves and three without two black leads which i am advised can be separated off at the proper time now what bids for the odontoglossum pavo ah i wonder who will have the honour of becoming the owner of this perfect this unmatched production of nature thank you sir hree hundred four five six seven in three places eight nine ten oh gentlemen let us get on a little faster thank you sir ifteen sixteen it is against you mr woodden ah thank you seventeen there came a pause in the fierce race for o pavo which i occupied in reducing seventeen hundred shillings to pounds sterling my word i thought to myself is a goodish price to pay for one plant however rare woodden is acting up to his instructions with a vengeance the pleading voice of mr primrose broke in upon my meditations gentlemen gentlemen he said surely you are not going to allow the most wondrous production of the floral world on which i repeat there is no reserve to be knocked down at this miserable figure come come well if i must i must though after such a disgrace i shall get no sleep toight one and his hammer fell for the first time think gentlemen upon my position think what the eminent owners who with their usual delicacy have stayed away will say to me when i am obliged to tell them the disgraceful truth two and his hammer fell a second time smith hold up that flower let the company see it let them know what they are losing smith held up the flower at which everybody glared the little ivory hammer circled round mr primrose s head it was about to fall when a quiet man with a long beard who hitherto had not joined in the bidding lifted his head and said softly eighteen hundred ah exclaimed mr primrose i thought so i thought that the owner of the greatest collection in england would not see this treasure slip from his grasp without a struggle against you mr woodden nineteen sir said woodden in a stony voice two thousand echoed the gentleman with the long beard twentyne hundred said woodden that s right mr woodden cried mr primrose you are indeed representing your principal worthily i feel sure that you do not mean to stop for a few miserable pounds not if i knows it ejaculated woodden i has my orders and i acts up to them twentywo hundred said longeard twentyhree echoed woodden oh damn shouted longeard and rushed from the room odontoglossum pavo is going for twentyhree hundred only twentyree hundred cried the auctioneer any advance on twentyhree hundred what none then i must do my duty one two for the last time o advance three gone to mr woodden bidding for his principal mr somers the hammer fell with a sharp tap and at this moment my young friend sauntered into the room well woodden he said have they put the pavo up yet it s up and it s down sir i ve bought him right enough the deuce you have what did it fetch woodden scratched his head i don t rightly know sir never was good at figures not having much book learning but it s twentyhree something no it would have brought more than that by jingo it must be that s pretty stiff but still it may be worth it at this moment mr primrose who leaning over his desk was engaged in animated conversation with an excited knot of orchid fanciers looked up oh there you are mr somers he said in the name of all this company let me congratulate you on having become the owner of the matchless odontoglossum pavo for what under all the circumstances i consider the quite moderate price of really that young man took it very well he shivered slightly and turned a little pale that is all woodden rocked to and fro like a tree about to fall i and my tin box collapsed together in the corner yes i was so surprised that my legs seemed to give way under me people began to talk but above the hum of the conversation i heard young somers say in a low voice woodden you re a born fool also the answer that s what my mother always told me master and she ought to know if anyone did but what s wrong now i obeyed orders and bought o paving yes don t bother my good fellow it s my fault not yours i the born fool but heavens above how am i to face this then recovering himself he strolled up to the rostrum and said a few words to the auctioneer mr primrose nodded and i heard him answer oh that will be all right sir don t bother we can t expect an account like this to be settled in a minute a month hence will do then he went on with the sale chapter sir alexander and stephen it was just at this moment that i saw standing by me a fineooking stout man with a square grey beard and a handsome but not very goodempered face he was looking about him as one does who finds himself in a place to which he is not accustomed perhaps you could tell me sir he said to me whether a gentleman called mr somers is in this room i am rather shortighted and there are a great many people yes i answered he has just bought the wonderful orchid called odontoglossum pavo that is what they are all talking about oh has he has he indeed and pray what did he pay for the article a huge sum i answered i thought it was two thousand three hundred shillings but it appears it was the handsome elderly gentleman grew very red in the face so red that i thought he was going to have a fit for a few moments he breathed heavily a rival collector i thought to myself and went on with the story which it occurred to me might interest him you see the young gentleman was called away to an interview with his father i heard him instruct his gardener a man named woodden to buy the plant at any price at any price indeed very interesting continue sir well the gardener bought it that s all after tremendous competition look there he is packing it up whether his master meant him to go as far as he did i rather doubt but here he comes if you know him the youthful mr somers looking a little pale and distrait strolled up apparently to speak to me his hands were in his pockets and an unlighted cigar was in his mouth his eyes fell upon the elderly gentleman a sight that caused him to shape his lips as though to whistle and drop the cigar hullo father he said in his pleasant voice i got your message and have been looking for you but never thought that i should find you here orchids aren t much in your line are they didn t you indeed replied his parent in a choked voice no i haven t much use for his stinking rubbish and he waved his umbrella at the beautiful flowers but it seems that you have stephen this little gentlemen here tells me you have just bought a very fine specimen i must apologize i broke in addressing mr somers i had not the slightest idea that this ig gentleman here the son smiled faintly was your intimate relation oh pray don t mr quatermain why should you not speak of what will be in all the papers yes father i have bought a very fine specimen the finest known or at least woodden has on my behalf while i was hunting for you which comes to the same thing indeed stephen and what did you pay for this flower i have heard a figure but think that there must be some mistake i don t know what you heard father but it seems to have been knocked down to me at it s a lot more than i can find indeed and i was going to ask you to lend me the money for the sake of the family credit if not for my own but we can talk about that afterwards yes stephen we can talk of that afterwards in fact as there is no time like the present we will talk of it now come to my office and sir this was to as you seem to know something of the circumstances i will ask you to come also and you too blockhead this was to woodden who just then approached with the plan now of course i might have refused an invitation conveyed in such a manner but as a matter of fact i didn t i wanted to see the thing out also to put in a word for young somers if i got the chance so we all departed from that room followed by a titter of amusement from those of the company who had overheard the conversation in the street stood a splendid carriage and pair a powdered footman opened its door with a ferocious bow sir alexander motioned to me to enter which i did taking one of the back seats as it gave more room for my tin case then came mr stephen then woodden bundled in holding the precious plant in front of him like a wand of office and last of all sir alexander having seen us safe entered also where to sir asked the footman office he snapped and we started four disappointed relatives in a funeral coach could not have been more silent our feelings seemed to be too deep for words sir alexander however did make one remark and to me it was if you will remove the corner of that infernal tin box of yours from my ribs i shall be obliged to you sir your pardon i exclaimed and in my efforts to be accommodating dropped it on his toe i will not repeat the remark he made but i may explain that he was gouty his son suddenly became afflicted with a sense of the absurdity of the situation he kicked me on the shin he even dared to wink and then began to swell visibly with suppressed laughter i was in agony for if he had exploded i do not know what would have happened fortunately at this moment the carriage stopped at the door of a fine office without waiting for the footman mr stephen bundled out and vanished into the building suppose to laugh in safety then i descended with the tin case then by command followed woodden with the flower and lastly came sir alexander stop here he said to the coachman i shan t be long be so good as to follow me mr what sourame and you too gardener we followed and found ourselves in a big room luxuriously furnished in a heavy kind of way sir alexander somers i should explain was an enormously opulent bullionroker whatever a bullionroker may be in this room mr stephen was already established indeed he was seated on the windowill swinging his leg now we are alone and comfortable growled sir alexander with sarcastic ferocity as the boaonstrictor said to the rabbit in the cage i remarked i did not mean to say it but i had grown nervous and the thought leapt from my lips in words again mr stephen began to swell he turned his face to the window as though to contemplate the wall beyond but i could see his shoulders shaking a dim light of intelligence shone in woodden s pale eyes about three minutes later the joke got home he gurgled something about boaonstrictors and rabbits and gave a short loud laugh as for sir alexander he merely said i did not catch your remark sir would you be so good as to repeat it as i appeared unwilling to accept the invitation he went on perhaps then you would repeat what you told me in that saleoom why should i i asked i spoke quite clearly and you seemed to understand you are right replied sir alexander to waste time is useless he wheeled round on woodden who was standing near the door still holding the paperrapped plant in front of him now blockhead he shouted tell me why you brought that thing woodden made no answer only rocked a little sir alexander reiterated his command this time woodden set the plant upon a table and replied if you re aspeaking to me sir that baint my name and what s more if you calls me so again i punch your head whoever you be and very deliberately he rolled up the sleeves on his brawny arms a sight at which i too began to swell with inward merriment look here father said mr stephen stepping forward what s the use of all this the thing s perfectly plain i did tell woodden to buy the plant at any price what is more i gave him a written authority which was passed up to the auctioneer there s no getting out of it it is true it never occurred to me that it would go for anything like he odd was more my idea but woodden only obeyed his orders and ought not to be abused for doing so there s what i call a master worth serving remarked woodden very well young man said sir alexander you have purchased this article will you be so good as to tell me how you propose it should be paid for i propose father that you should pay for it replied mr stephen sweetly two thousand three hundred pounds or ten times that amount would not make you appreciably poorer but if as is probable you take a different view then i propose to pay for it myself as you know a certain sum of money came to me under my mother s will in which you have only a life interest i shall raise the amount upon that security r otherwise if sir alexander had been angry before now he became like a mad bull in a china shop he pranced round the room he used language that should not pass the lips of any respectable merchant of bullion in short he did everything that a person in his position ought not to do when he was tired he rushed to a desk tore a cheque from a book and filled it in for a sum of to bearer which cheque he blotted crumpled up and literally threw at the head of his son you worthless idle young scoundrel he bellowed i put you in this office here that you may learn respectable and orderly habits and in due course succeed to a very comfortable business what happens you don t take a ha porth of interest in bullionroking a subject of which i believe you to remain profoundly ignorant you don t even spend your money or rather my money upon any gentlemanike vice such as horseacing or cards or even ell never mind no you take to flowers miserable beastly flowers things that a cow eats and clerks grow in back gardens an ancient and arcadian taste adam is supposed to have lived in a garden i ventured to interpolate perhaps you would ask your friend with the stubbly hair to remain quiet snorted sir alexander i was about to add although for the sake of my name i meet your debts that i have had enough of this kind of thing i disinherit you or will do if i live till p when the lawyer s office shuts for thank god there are no entailed estates and i dismiss you from the firm you can go and earn your living in any way you please by orchidunting if you like he paused gasping for breath is that all father asked mr stephen producing a cigar from his pocket no it isn t you coldlooded young beggar that house you occupy at twickenham is mine you will be good enough to clear out of it i wish to take possession i suppose father i am entitled to a week s notice like any other tenant said mr stephen lighting the cigar in fact he added if you answer no i think i shall ask you to apply for an ejection order you will understand that i have arrangements to make before taking a fresh start in life oh curse your cheek you ou ucumber raged the infuriated merchant prince then an inspiration came to him you think more of an ugly flower than of your father do you well at least i put an end to that and he made a dash at the plant on the table with the evident intention of destroying the same but the watching woodden saw with a kind of lurch he interposed his big frame between sir alexander and the object of his wrath touch o paving and i knocks yer down he drawled out sir alexander looked at o paving then he looked at woodden s legfutton fist and hanged his mind curse o paving he said and everyone who has to do with it and swung out of the room banging the door behind him well that s over said mr stephen gently as he fanned himself with a pocketandkerchief quite exciting while it lasted wasn t it mr quatermain ut i have been there before so to speak and now what do you say to some luncheon pym s is close by and they have very good oysters only i think we drive round by the bank and hand in this cheque when he s angry my parent is capable of anything he might even stop it woodden get off down to twickenham with o pavo keep it warm for it feels rather like frost put it in the stove for toight and give it a little just a little tepid water but be careful not to touch the flower take a fourheeled cab it s slow but safe and mind you keep the windows up and don t smoke i shall be home for dinner woodden pulled his forelock seized the pot in his left hand and departed with his right fist raised suppose in case sir alexander should be waiting for him round the corner then we departed also and after stopping for a minute at the bank to pay in the cheque which i noted notwithstanding its amount was accepted without comment ate oysters in a place too crowded to allow of conversation mr quatermain said my host it is obvious that we cannot talk here and much less look at that orchid of yours which i want to study at leisure now for a week or so at any rate i have a roof over my head and in short will you be my guest for a night or two i know nothing about you and of me you only know that i am the disinherited son of a father to whom i have failed to give satisfaction still it is possible that we might pass a few pleasant hours together talking of flowers and other things that is if you have no previous engagement i have none i answered i am only a stranger from south africa lodging at an hotel if you will give me time to call for my bag i will pass the night at your house with pleasure by the aid of mr somers smart dogart which was waiting at a city mews we reached twickenham while there was still half an hour of daylight the house which was called verbena lodge was small a square redrick building of the early georgian period but the gardens covered quite an acre of ground and were very beautiful or must have been so in summer into the greenhouse we did not enter because it was too late to see the flowers also just when we came to them woodden arrived in his fourheeled cab and departed with his master to see to the housing of o pavo then came dinner a very pleasant meal my host had that day been turned out upon the world but he did not allow this circumstance to interfere with his spirits in the least also he was evidently determined to enjoy its good things while they lasted for his champagne and port were excellent you see mr quatermain he said it s just as well we had the row which has been boiling up for a long while my respected father has made so much money that he thinks i should go and do likewise now i don t see it i like flowers especially orchids and i hate bullionroking to me the only decent places in london are that saleoom where we met and the horticultural gardens yes i answered rather doubtfully but the matter seems a little serious your parent was very emphatic as to his intentions and after this kind of thing and i pointed to the beautiful silver and the port how will you like roughing it in a hard world don t think i shall mind a bit it would be rather a pleasant change also even if my father doesn t alter his mind as he may for he likes me at bottom because i resemble my dear mother things ain t so very bad i have got some money that she left me or and i sell that odontoglossum pavo for what it will fetch to sir joshua tredgold e was the man with the long beard who you tell me ran up woodden to over r failing him to someone else i write about it toight i don t think i have any debts to speak of for the governor has been allowing me a year at least that is my share of the profits paid to me in return for my bullionroking labours and except flowers i have no expensive tastes so the devil take the past here s to the future and whatever it may bring and he polished off the glass of port he held and laughed in his jolly fashion really he was a most attractive young man a little reckless it is true but then recklessness and youth well like brandy and soda i echoed the toast and drank off my port for i like a good glass of wine when i can get it as would anyone who has had to live for months on rotten water although i admit that agrees with me better than the port now mr quatermain he went on if you have done light your pipe and let s go into the other room and study that cypripedium of yours i shan t sleep toight unless i see it again first stop a bit though we get hold of that old ass woodden before he turns in woodden said his master when the gardener had arrived this gentleman mr quatermain is going to show you an orchid that is ten times finer than o pavo beg pardon sir answered woodden but if mr quatermain says that he lies it ain t in nature it don t bloom nowhere i opened the case and revealed the golden cypripedium woodden stared at it and rocked then he stared again and felt his head as though to make sure it was on his shoulders then he gasped well if that there flower baint made up it s a master one if i could see that there flower ablowing on the plant i die happy woodden stop talking and sit down exclaimed his master yes there where you can look at the flower now mr quatermain will you tell us the story of that orchid from beginning to end of course omitting its habitat if you like for it isn t fair to ask that secret woodden can be trusted to hold his tongue and so can i i remarked that i was sure they could and for the next halfour talked almost without interruption keeping nothing back and explaining that i was anxious to find someone who would finance an expedition to search for this particular plant as i believed the only one of its sort that existed in the world how much will it cost asked mr somers i lay it at i answered you see we must have plenty of men and guns and stores also trade goods and presents i call that cheap but supposing mr quatermain that the expedition proves successful and the plant is secured what then then i propose that brother john who found it and of whom i have told you should take onehird of whatever it might sell for that i as captain of the expedition should take onehird and that whoever finds the necessary money should take the remaining third good that s settled what s settled i asked why that we should divide in the proportions you named only i bargain to be allowed to take my whack in kind mean in plant and to have the first option of purchasing the rest of the plant at whatever value may be agreed upon but mr somers do you mean that you wish to find and make this expedition in person of course i do i thought you understood that that is if you will have me your old friend the lunatic you and i will together seek for and find this golden flower i say that s settled on the morrow accordingly it was settled with the help of a document signed in duplicate by both of us before these arrangements were finally concluded however i insisted that mr somers should meet my late companion charlie scroope when i was not present in order that the latter might give him a full and particular report concerning myself apparently the interview was satisfactory at least so i judged from the very cordial and even respectful manner in which young somers met me after it was over also i thought it my duty to explain to him with much clearness in the presence of scroope as a witness the great dangers of such an enterprise as that on which he proposed to embark i told him straight out that he must be prepared to find his death in it from starvation fever wild beasts or at the hands of savages while success was quite problematical and very likely would not be attained you are taking these risks he said yes i answered but they are incident to the rough trade i follow which is that of a hunter and explorer moreover my youth is past and i have gone through experiences and bereavements of which you know nothing that cause me to set a very slight value on life i care little whether i die or continue in the world for some few added years lastly the excitement of adventure has become a kind of necessity for me i do not think that i could live in england for very long also i a fatalist i believe that when my time comes i must go that this hour is foreordained and that nothing i can do will either hasten or postpone it by one moment your circumstances are different you are quite young if you stay here and approach your father in a proper spirit i have no doubt but that he will forget all the rough words he said to you the other day for which indeed you know you gave him some provocation is it worth while throwing up such prospects and undertaking such dangers for the chance of finding a rare flower i say this to my own disadvantage since i might find it hard to discover anyone else who would risk upon such a venture but i do urge you to weigh my words young somers looked at me for a little while then he broke into one of his hearty laughs and exclaimed whatever else you may be mr allan quatermain you are a gentleman no bullionroker in the city could have put the matter more fairly in the teeth of his own interests thank you i said for the rest he went on i too am tired of england and want to see the world it isn t the golden cypripedium that i seek although i should like to win it well enough that s only a symbol what i seek are adventure and romance also like you i am a fatalist god chose his own time to send us here and i presume that he will choose his own time to take us away again so i leave the matter of risks to him yes mr somers i replied rather solemnly you may find adventure and romance there are plenty of both in africa or you may find a nameless grave in some feveraunted swamp well you have chosen and i like your spirit still i was so little satisfied about this business that a week or so before we sailed after much consideration i took it upon myself to write a letter to sir alexander somers in which i set forth the whole matter as clearly as i could not blinking the dangerous nature of our undertaking in conclusion i asked him whether he thought it wise to allow his only son to accompany such an expedition mainly because of a not very serious quarrel with himself as no answer came to this letter i went on with our preparations there was money in plenty since the reale of o pavo to sir joshua tredgold at some loss had been satisfactorily carried out which enabled me to invest in all things needful with a cheerful heart never before had i been provided with such an outfit as that which preceded us to the ship at length the day of departure came we stood on the platform at paddington waiting for the dartmouth train to start for in those days the african mail sailed from that port a minute or two before the train left as we were preparing to enter our carriage i caught sight of a face that i seemed to recognise the owner of which was evidently searching for someone in the crowd it was that of briggs sir alexander s clerk whom i had met in the saleoom mr briggs i said as he passed me are you looking for mr somers if so he is in here the clerk jumped into the compartment and handed a letter to mr somers then he emerged again and waited somers read the letter and tore off a blank sheet from the end of it on which he hastily wrote some words he passed it to me to give to briggs and i could not help seeing what was written it was too late now god bless you my dear father i hope we may meet again if not try to think kindly of your troublesome and foolish son stephen in another minute the train had started by the way he said as we steamed out of the station i have heard from my father who enclosed this for you i opened the envelope which was addressed in a bold round hand that seemed to me typical of the writer and read as follows my dear sir appreciate the motives which caused you to write to me and i thank you very heartily for your letter which shows me that you are a man of discretion and strict honour as you surmise the expedition on which my son has entered is not one that commends itself to me as prudent of the differences between him and myself you are aware for they came to a climax in your presence indeed i feel that i owe you an apology for having dragged you into an unpleasant family quarrel your letter only reached me toay having been forwarded to my place in the country from my office i should have at once come to town but unfortunately i am laid up with an attack of gout which makes it impossible for me to stir therefore the only thing i can do is to write to my son hoping that the letter which i send by a special messenger will reach him in time and avail to alter his determination to undertake this journey here i may add that although i have differed and do differ from him on various points i still have a deep affection for my son and earnestly desire his welfare the prospect of any harm coming to him is one upon which i cannot bear to dwell now i am aware that any change of his plans at this eleventh hour would involve you in serious loss and inconvenience i beg to inform you formally therefore that in this event i will make good everything and will in addition write off the which i understand he has invested in your joint venture it may be however that my son who has in him a vein of my own obstinacy will refuse to change his mind in that event under a higher power i can only commend him to your care and beg that you will look after him as though he were your own child i can ask and you can do no more tell him to write me as opportunity offers as perhaps you will too also that although i hate the sight of them i will look after the flowers which he has left at the house at twickenham your obliged servant alexander somers this letter touched me much and indeed made me feel very uncomfortable without a word i handed it to my companion who read it through carefully nice of him about the orchids he said my dad has a good heart although he lets his temper get the better of him having had his own way all his life well what will you do i asked go on of course i ve put my hand to the plough and i am not going to turn back i should be a cur if i did and what s more whatever he might say he think none the better of me so please don t try to persuade me it would be no good for quite a while afterwards young somers seemed to be comparatively depressed a state of mind that in his case was rare indeed at last he studied the wintry landscape through the carriage window and said nothing by degrees however he recovered and when we reached dartmouth was as cheerful as ever a mood that i could not altogether share before we sailed i wrote to sir alexander telling him exactly how things stood and so i think did his son though he never showed me the letter at durban just as we were about to start up country i received an answer from him sent by some boat that followed us very closely in it he said that he quite understood the position and whatever happened would attribute no blame to me whom he should always regard with friendly feelings he told me that in the event of any difficulty or want of money i was to draw on him for whatever might be required and that he had advised the african bank to that effect further he added that at least his son had shown grit in this matter for which he respected him and now for a long while i must bid goodye to sir alexander somers and all that has to do with england chapter mavovo and hans we arrived safely at durban at the beginning of march and took up our quarters at my house on the berea where i expected that brother john would be awaiting us but no brother john was to be found the old lame griqua jack who looked after the place for me and once had been one of my hunters said that shortly after i went away in the ship dogeetah as he called him had taken his tin box and his net and walked off inland he knew not where leaving as he declared no message or letter behind him the cases full of butterflies and dried plants were also gone but these i found he had shipped to some port in america by a sailing vessel bound for the united states which chanced to put in at durban for food and water as to what had become of the man himself i could get no clue he had been seen at maritzburg and according to some kaffirs whom i knew afterwards on the borders of zululand where so far as i could learn he vanished into space this to say the least of it was disconcerting and a question arose as to what was to be done brother john was to have been our guide he alone knew the mazitu people he alone had visited the borders of the mysterious pongoand i scarcely felt inclined to attempt to reach that country without his aid when a fortnight had gone by and still there were no signs of him stephen and i held a solemn conference i pointed out the difficulties and dangers of the situation to him and suggested that under the circumstances it might be wise to give up this wild orchidhase and go elephantunting instead in a certain part of zululand where in those days these animals were still abundant he was inclined to agree with me since the prospect of killing elephants had attractions for him and yet i said after reflection it s curious but i never remember making a successful trip after altering plans at the last moment that is unless one was driven to it i vote we toss up said somers it gives providence a chance now then heads for the golden cyp and tails for the elephants he spun a halfrown into the air it fell and rolled under a great yellowood chest full of curiosities that i had collected which it took all our united strength to move we dragged it aside and not without some excitement for really a good deal hung upon the chance i lit a match and peered into the shadow there in the dust lay the coin what is it i asked of somers who was stretched on his stomach on the chest orchid mean head he answered well that s settled so we needn t bother any more the next fortnight was a busy time for me as it happened there was a schooner in the bay of about one hundred tons burden which belonged to a portuguese trader named delgado who dealt in goods that he carried to the various east african ports and madagascar he was a villainousooking person whom i suspected of having dealings with the slave traders who were very numerous and a great power in those days if indeed he were not one himself but as he was going to kilwa whence we proposed to start inland i arranged to make use of him to carry our party and the baggage the bargain was not altogether easy to strike for two reasons first he did not appear to be anxious that we should hunt in the districts at the back of kilwa where he assured me there was no game and secondly he said that he wanted to sail at once however i overcame his objections with an argument he could not resist amely money and in the end he agreed to postpone his departure for fourteen days then i set about collecting our men of whom i had made up my mind there must not be less than twenty already i had sent messengers summoning to durban from zululand and the upper districts of natal various hunters who had accompanied me on other expeditions to the number of a dozen or so they arrived in due course i have always had the good fortune to be on the best of terms with my kaffirs and where i went they were ready to go without asking any questions the man whom i had selected to be their captain under me was a zulu of the name of mavovo he was a short fellow past middle age with an enormous chest his strength was proverbial indeed it was said that he could throw an ox by the horns and myself i have seen him hold down the head of a wounded buffalo that had fallen until i could come up and shoot it when i first knew mavovo he was a petty chief and witch doctor in zululand like myself he had fought for the prince umbelazi in the great battle of the tugela a crime which cetewayo never forgave him about a year afterwards he got warning that he had been smelt out as a wizard and was going to be killed he fled with two of his wives and a child the slayers overtook them before he could reach the natal border and stabbed the elder wife and the child of the second wife they were four men but made mad by the sight mavovo turned on them and killed them all then with the remaining wife cut to pieces as he was he crept to the river and through it to natal not long after this wife died also it was said from grief at the loss of her child mavovo did not marry again perhaps because he was now a man without means for cetewayo had taken all his cattle also he was made ugly by an assegai wound which had cut off his right nostril shortly after the death of his second wife he sought me out and told me he was a chief without a kraal and wished to become my hunter so i took him on a step which i never had any cause to regret since although morose and at times given to the practice of uncanny arts he was a most faithful servant and brave as a lion or rather as a buffalo for a lion is not always brave another man whom i did not send for but who came was an old hottentot named hans with whom i had been more or less mixed up all my life when i was a boy he was my father s servant in the cape colony and my companion in some of those early wars also he shared some very terrible adventures with me which i have detailed in the history i have written of my first wife marie marais for instance he and i were the only persons who escaped from the massacre of retief and his companions by the zulu king dingaan in the subsequence campaigns including the battle of the blood river he fought at my side and ultimately received a good share of captured cattle after this he retired and set up a native store at a place called pinetown about fifteen miles out of durban here i am afraid he got into bad ways and took to drink more or less also to gambling at any rate he lost most of his property so much of it indeed that he scarcely knew which way to turn thus it happened that one evening when i went out of the house where i had been making up my accounts i saw a yellowaced whiteaired old fellow squatted on the verandah smoking a pipe made out of a cornob good day baas he said here am i hans so i see i answered rather coldly and what are you doing here hans how can you spare time from your drinking and gambling at pinetown to visit me here hans after i have not seen you for three years baas the gambling is finished because i have nothing more to stake and the drinking is done too because but one bottle of cape smoke makes me feel quite ill next morning so now i only take water and as little of that as i can water and some tobacco to cover up its taste i am glad to hear it hans if my father the predikant who baptised you were alive now he would have much to say about your conduct as indeed i have no doubt he will presently when you have gone into a hole i e a grav for there in the hole he will be waiting for you hans i know i know baas i have been thinking of that and it troubles me your reverend father the predikant will be very cross indeed with me when i join him in the place of fires where he sits awaiting me so i wish to make my peace with him by dying well and in your service baas i hear that the baas is going on an expedition i have come to accompany the baas to accompany me why you are old you are not worth five shillings a month and your scoff foo you are a shrunken old brandy cask that will not even hold water hans grinned right across his ugly face oh baas i am old but i am clever all these years i have been gathering wisdom i am as full of it as a bee s nest is with honey when the summer is done and baas i can stop those leaks in the cask hans it is no good i don t want you i am going into great danger i must have those about me whom i can trust well baas and who can be better trusted than hans who warned you of the attack of the quabies on maraisfontein and so saved the life of hush i said i understand i will not speak the name it is holy not to be mentioned it is the name of one who stands with the white angels before god not to be mentioned by poor drunken hans still who stood at your side in that great fight ah it makes me young again to think of it when the roof burned when the door was broken down when we met the quabies on the spears when you held the pistol to the head of the holy one whose name must not be mentioned the great one who knew how to die oh baas our lives are twisted up together like the creeper and the tree and where you go there i must go also do not turn me away i ask no wages only a bit of food and a handful of tobacco and the light of your face and a word now and again of the memories that belong to both of us i am still very strong i can shoot well ell baas who was it that put it into your mind to aim at the tails of the vultures on the hill of slaughter yonder in zululand and so saved the lives of all the boer people and of her whose holy name must not be mentioned baas you will not turn me away no i answered you can come but you will swear by the spirit of my father the predikant to touch no liquor on this journey i swear by his spirit and by that of the holy one and he flung himself forward on to his knees took my hand and kissed it then he rose and said in a matterfact tone if the baas can give me two blankets i shall thank him also five shillings to buy some tobacco and a new knife where are the baas s guns i must go to oil them i beg that the baas will take with him that little rifle which is named intombi maide the one with which he shot the vultures on the hill of slaughter the one that killed the geese in the goose kloof when i loaded for him and he won the great match against the boer whom dingaan called twoaces good i said here are the five shillings you shall have the blankets and a new gun and all things needful you will find the guns in the little back room and with them those of the baas my companion who also is your master go see to them at length all was ready the cases of guns ammunition medicines presents and food were on board the maria so were four donkeys that i had bought in the hope that they would prove useful either to ride or as pack beasts the donkey be it remembered and man are the only animals which are said to be immune from the poisonous effects of the bite of tsetse fly except of course the wild game it was our last night at durban a very beautiful night of full moon at the end of march for the portugee delgado had announced his intention of sailing on the following afternoon stephen somers and i were seated on the stoep smoking and talking things over it is a strange thing i said that brother john should never have turned up i know that he was set upon making this expedition not only for the sake of the orchid but also for some other reason of which he would not speak i think that the old fellow must be dead very likely answered stephen we had become intimate and i called him stephen no a man alone among savages might easily come to grief and never be heard of again hark what s that and he pointed to some gardenia bushes in the shadow of the house near by whence came a sound of something that moved a dog i expect or perhaps it is hans he curls up in all sorts of places near to where i may be hans are you there a figure arose from the gardenia bushes ja i am here baas what are you doing hans i am doing what the dog does baas atching my master good i answered then an idea struck me hans you have heard of the white baas with the long beard whom the kaffirs call dogeetah i have heard of him and once i saw him a few moons ago passing through pinetown a kaffir with him told me that he was going over the drakensberg to hunt for things that crawl and fly being quite mad baas well where is he now hans he should have been here to travel with us am i a spirit that i can tell the baas whither a white man has wandered yet stay mavovo may be able to tell he is a great doctor he can see through distance and even now this very night his snake of divination has entered into him and he is looking into the future yonder behind the house i saw him form the circle i translated what hans said to stephen for he had been talking in dutch then asked him if he would like to see some kaffir magic of course he answered but it s all bosh isn t it oh yes all bosh or so most people say i answered evasively still sometimes these inyangas tell one strange things then led by hans we crept round the house to where there was a fiveoot stone wall at the back of the stable beyond this wall within the circle of some huts where my kaffirs lived was an open space with an anteap floor where they did their cooking here facing us sat mavovo while in a ring around him were all the hunters who were to accompany us also jack the lame griqua and the two houseoys in front of mavovo burned a number of little wood fires i counted them and found that there were fourteen which i reflected was the exact number of our hunters plus ourselves one of the hunters was engaged in feeding these fires with little bits of stick and handfuls of dried grass so as to keep them burning brightly the others sat round perfectly silent and watched with rapt attention mavovo himself looked like a man who is asleep he was crouched on his haunches with his big head resting almost upon his knees about his middle was a snakekin and round his neck an ornament that appeared to be made of human teeth on his right side lay a pile of feathers from the wings of vultures and on his left a little heap of silver money suppose the fees paid by the hunters for whom he was divining after we had watched him for some while from our shelter behind the wall he appeared to wake out of his sleep first he muttered then he looked up to the moon and seemed to say a prayer of which i could not catch the words next he shuddered three times convulsively and exclaimed in a clear voice my snake has come it is within me now i can hear now i can see three of the little fires those immediately in front of him were larger than the others he took up his bundle of vultures feathers selected one with care held it towards the sky then passed it through the flame of the centre one of the three fires uttering as he did so my native name macumazana withdrawing it from the flame he examined the charred edges of the feather very carefully a proceeding that caused a cold shiver to go down my back for i knew well that he was inquiring of his spirit what would be my fate upon this expedition how it answered i cannot tell for he laid the feather down and took another with which he went through the same process this time however the name he called out was mwamwazela which in its shortened form of wazela was the kaffir appellation that the natives had given to stephen somers it means a smile and no doubt was selected for him because of his pleasant smiling countenance having passed it through the rightand fire of the three he examined it and laid it down so it went on one after another he called out the names of the hunters beginning with his own as captain passed the feather which represented each of them through the particular fire of his destiny examined and laid it down after this he seemed to go to sleep again for a few minutes then woke up as a man does from a natural slumber yawned and stretched himself speak said his audience with great anxiety have you seen have you heard what does your snake tell you of me of me of me of me i have seen i have heard he answered my snake tells me that this will be a very dangerous journey of those who go on it six will die by the bullet by the spear or by sickness and others will be hurt ow said one of them but which will die and which will come out safe does not your snake tell you that o doctor yes of course my snake tells me that but my snake tells me also to hold my tongue on the matter lest some of us should be turned to cowards it tells me further that the first who should ask me more will be one of those who must die now do you ask or you or you or you ask if you will strange to say no one accepted the invitation never have i seen a body of men so indifferent to the future at least to every appearance one and all they seemed to come to the conclusion that so far as they were concerned it might be left to look after itself my snake told me something else went on mavovo it is that if among this company there is any jackal of a man who thinking that he might be one of the six to die dreams to avoid his fate by deserting it will be of no use for then my snake will point him out and show me how to deal with him now with one voice each man present there declared that desertion from the lord macumazana was the last thing that could possibly occur to him indeed i believe that those brave fellows spoke truth no doubt they put faith in mavovo s magic after the fashion of their race still the death he promised was some way off and each hoped he would be one of the six to escape moreover the zulu of those days was too accustomed to death to fear its terrors over much one of them did however venture to advance the argument which mavovo treated with proper contempt that the shillings paid for this divination should be returned by him to the next heirs of such of them as happened to decease why he asked should these pay a shilling in order to be told that they must die it seemed unreasonable certainly the zulu kaffirs have a queer way of looking at things hans i whispered is your fire among those that burn yonder not so baas he wheezed back into my ear does the baas think me a fool if i must die i must die if i am to live i shall live why then should i pay a shilling to learn what time will declare moreover yonder mavovo takes the shillings and frightens everybody but tells nobody anything i call it cheating but baas do you and the baas wazela have no fear you did not pay shillings and therefore mavovo though without doubt he is a great inyanga cannot really prophesy concerning you since his snake will not work without a fee the argument seems remarkably absurd yet it must be common for now that i come to think of it no gipsy will tell a true fortune unless her hand is crossed with silver i say quatermain said stephen idly since our friend mavovo seems to know so much ask him what has become of brother john as hans suggested tell me what he says afterwards for i want to see something so i went through the little gate in the wall in a natural kind of way as though i had seen nothing and appeared to be struck by the sight of the little fires well mavovo i said are you doing doctor s work i thought that it had brought you into enough trouble in zululand that is so baba replied mavovo who had a habit of calling me father though he was older than i it cost me my chieftainship and my cattle and my two wives and my son it made of me a wanderer who is glad to accompany a certain macumazana to strange lands where many things may befall me yes he added with meaning even the last of all things and yet a gift is a gift and must be used you baba have a gift of shooting and do you cease to shoot you have a gift of wandering and can you cease to wander he picked up one of the burnt feathers from the little pile by his side and looked at it attentively perhaps baba you have been told y ears are very sharp and i thought i heard some such words floating through the air just now hat we poor kaffir inyangas can prophesy nothing true unless we are paid and perhaps that is a fact so far as something of the moment is concerned and yet the snake in the inyanga jumping over the little rock which hides the present from it may see the path that winds far and far away through the valleys across the streams up the mountains till it is lost in the heaven above thus on this feather burnt in my magic fire i seem to see something of your future o my father macumazana far and far your road runs and he drew his finger along the feather here is a journey and he flicked away a carbonised flake here is another and another and another and he flicked off flake after flake here is one that is very successful it leaves you rich and here is yet one more a wonderful journey this in which you see strange things and meet strange people then nd he blew on the feather in such a fashion that all the charred filaments brother john says that laminae is the right word for the fell away from it then there is nothing left save such a pole as some of my people stick upright on a grave the shaft of memory they call it o my father you will die in a distant land but you will leave a great memory behind you that will live for hundreds of years for see how strong is this quill over which the fire has had no power with some of these others it is quite different he added i daresay i broke in but mavovo be so good as to leave me out of your magic for i don t at all want to know what is going to happen to me toay is enough for me without studying next month and next year there is a saying in our holy book which runs sufficient to the day is its evil quite so o macumazana also that is a very good saying as some of those hunters of yours are thinking now yet an hour ago they were forcing their shillings on me that i might tell them of the future and you too want to know something you did not come through that gate to quote to me the wisdom of your holy book what is it baba be quick for my snake is getting very tired he wishes to go back to his hole in the world beneath well then i answered in rather a shamefaced fashion for mavovo had an uncanny way of seeing into one s secret motives i should like to know if you can tell me which you can t what has become of the white man with the long beard whom you black people call dogeetah he should have been here to go on this journey with us indeed he was to be our guide and we cannot find him where is he and why is he not here have you anything about you that belonged to dogeetah macumazana no i answered that is yes and from my pocket i produced the stump of pencil that brother john had given me which being economical i had saved up ever since mavovo took it and after considering it carefully as he had done in the case of the feathers swept up a pile of ashes with his horny hand from the edge of the largest of the little fires that indeed which had represented myself these ashes he patted flat then he drew on them with the point of the pencil tracing what seemed to me to be the rough image of a man such as children scratch upon whitewashed walls when he had finished he sat up and contemplated his handiwork with all the satisfaction of an artist a breeze had risen from the sea and was blowing in little gusts so that the fine ashes were disturbed some of the lines of the picture being filled in and others altered or enlarged for a while mavovo sat with his eyes shut then he opened them studied the ashes and what remained of the picture and taking a blanket that lay near by threw it over his own head and over the ashes withdrawing it again presently he cast it aside and pointed to the picture which was now quite changed indeed in the moonlight it looked more like a landscape than anything else all is clear my father he said in a matterfact voice the white wanderer dogeetah is not dead he lives but he is sick something is the matter with one of his legs so that he cannot walk perhaps a bone is broken or some beast has bitten him he lies in a hut such as kaffirs make only this hut has a verandah round it like your stoep and there are drawings on the wall the hut is a long way off i don t know where is that all i asked for he paused no not all dogeetah is recovering he will join us in that country whither we journey at a time of trouble that is all and the fee is halfrown you mean one shilling i suggested no my father macumazana one shilling for simple magic such as foretelling the fate of common black people halfrown for very difficult magic that has to do with white people magic of which only great doctors like me mavovo are the masters i gave him the halfrown and said look here friend mavovo i believe in you as a fighter and a hunter but as a magician i think you are a humbug indeed i am so sure of it that if ever dogeetah turns up at a time of trouble in that land whither we are journeying i will make you a present of that doublearrelled rifle of mine which you admired so much one of his rare smiles appeared upon mavovo s ugly face then give it to me now baba he said for it is already earned my snake cannot lie specially when the fee is halfrown i shook my head and declined politely but with firmness ah said mavovo you white men are very clever and think that you know everything but it is not so for in learning so much that is new you have forgotten more that is old when the snake that is in you macumazana dwelt in a black savage like me a thousand thousand years ago you could have done and did what i do but now you can only mock and say mavovo the brave in battle the great hunter the loyal man becomes a liar when he blows the burnt feather or reads what the wind writes upon the charmed ashes i do not say that you are a liar mavovo i say that you are deceived by your own imaginings it is not possible that man can know what is hidden from man is it indeed so o macumazana watcher by night am i mavovo the pupil of zikali the opener of roads the greatest of wizards indeed deceived by my own imaginings and has man no other eyes but those in his head that he cannot see what is hidden from man well you say so and all we black people know that you are very clever and why should i a poor zulu be able to see what you cannot see yet when toorrow one sends you a message from the ship in which we are to sail begging you to come fast because there is trouble on the ship then bethink you of your words and my words and whether or no man can see what is hidden from man in the blackness of the future oh that rifle of yours is mine already though you will not give it to me now you who think that i am a cheat well my father macumazana because you think i am a cheat never again will i blow the feather or read what the wind writes upon the ashes for you or any who eat your food then he rose saluted me with uplifted right hand collected his little pile of money and bag of medicines and marched off to the sleeping hut on our way round the house we met my old lame caretaker jack inkoosi he said the white chief wazela bade me say that he and the cook sam have gone to sleep on board the ship to look after the goods sam came up just now and fetched him away he says he will show you why toorrow i nodded and passed on wondering to myself why stephen had suddenly determined to stay the night on the maria chapter hassan i suppose it must have been two hours after dawn on the following morning that i was awakened by knocks upon the door and the voice of jack saying that sam the cook wanted to speak to me wondering what he could be doing there as i understood he was sleeping on the ship i called out that he was to come in now this sam i should say hailed from the cape and was a person of mixed blood the original stock i imagine was malay which had been crossed with indian coolie also somewhere or other there was a dash of white and possibly but of this i am not sure a little hottentot the result was a person of few vices and many virtues sammy i may say at once was perhaps the biggest coward i ever met he could not help it it was congenital though curiously enough this cowardice of his never prevented him from rushing into fresh danger thus he knew that the expedition upon which i was engaged would be most hazardous remembering his weakness i explained this to him very clearly yet that knowledge did not deter him from imploring that he might be allowed to accompany me perhaps this was because there was some mutual attachment between us as in the case of hans once a good many years before i had rescued sammy from a somewhat serious scrape by declining to give evidence against him i need not enter into the details but a certain sum of money over which he had control had disappeared i will merely say therefore that at the time he was engaged to a coloured lady of very expensive tastes whom in the end he never married after this as it chanced he nursed me through an illness hence the attachment of which i have spoken sammy was the son of a native christian preacher and brought up upon what he called the word he had received an excellent education for a person of his class and in addition to many native dialects with which a varied career had made him acquainted spoke english perfectly though in the most bombastic style never would he use a short word if a long one came to his hand or rather to his tongue for several years of his life he was i believe a teacher in a school at capetown where coloured persons received their education his department as he called it being english language and literature wearying of or being dismissed from his employment for some reason that he never specified he had drifted up the coast to zanzibar where he turned his linguistic abilities to the study of arabic and became the manager or head cook of an hotel after a few years he lost this billet i know not how or why and appeared at durban in what he called a reversed position here it was that we met again just before my expedition to pongoand in manners he was most polite in disposition most religious i believe he was a baptist by faith and in appearance a small brown dandy of a man of uncertain age who wore his hair parted in the middle and whatever the circumstances was always tidy in his garments i took him on because he was in great distress an excellent cook the best of nurses and above all for the reason that as i have said we were in a way attached to each other also he always amused me intensely which goes for something on a long journey of the sort that i contemplated such in brief was sammy as he entered the room i saw that his clothes were very wet and asked him at once if it were raining or whether he had got drunk and been sleeping in the damp grass no mr quatermain he answered the morning is extremely fine and like the poor hottentot hans i have abjured the use of intoxicants though we differ on much else in this matter we agree then what the deuce is up i interrupted to cut short his flow of fine language sir there is trouble on the ship remembering mavovo i started at these word where i passed the night in the company of mr somers at his special request it was the other way about really this morning before the dawn when he thought that everybody was asleep the portuguese captain and some of his arabs began to weigh the anchor quite quietly also to hoist the sails but mr somers and i being very much awake came out of the cabin and he sat upon the capstan with a revolver in his hand saying ell sir i will not repeat what he said no don t what happened then then sir there followed much noise and confusion the portugee and the arabs threatened mr somers but he sir continued to sit upon the capstan with the stern courage of a rock in a rushing stream and remarked that he would see them all somewhere before they touched it after this sir i do not know what occurred since while i watched from the bulwarks someone knocked me head over heels into the sea and being fortunately a good swimmer i gained the shore and hurried here to advise you and did you advise anyone else you idiot i asked yes sir as i sped along i communicated to an officer of the port that there was the devil of a mess upon the maria which he would do well to investigate by this time i was in my shirt and trousers and shouting to mavovo and the others soon they arrived for as the costume of mavovo and his company consisted only of a moocha and a blanket it did not take them long to dress mavovo i began there is trouble on the ship o baba he interrupted with something resembling a grin it is very strange but last night i dreamed that i told you curse your dreams i said gather the men and go down o that won t work there would be murder done either it is all over now or it is all right get the hunters ready i come with them the luggage can be fetched afterwards within less than an hour we were at that wharf off which the maria lay in what one day will be the splendid port of durban though in those times its shipping arrangements were exceedingly primitive a strangeooking band we must have been i who was completely dressed and i trust tidy marched ahead next came hans in the filthy widewake hat which he usually wore and greasy corduroys and after him the oleaginous sammy arrayed in european reacheowns a billyock and a bright blue tie striped with red garments that would have looked very smart had it not been for his recent immersion after him followed the fierceooking mavovo and his squad of hunters all of whom wore the ring or isicoco as the zulus call it that is a circle of polished black wax sewn into their short hair they were a grim set of fellows but as according to a recent law it was not allowable for them to appear armed in the town their guns had already been shipped while their broad stabbing spears were rolled up in their sleeping mats the blades wrapped round with dried grass each of them however bore in his hand a large knobkerry of redood and they marched four by four in martial fashion it is true that when we embarked on the big boat to go to the ship much of their warlike ardour evaporated since these men who feared nothing on the land were terribly afraid of that unfamiliar element the water we reached the maria an unimposing kind of tub and climbed aboard on looking aft the first thing that i saw was stephen seated on the capstan with a pistol in his hand as sammy had said near by leaning on the bulwark was the villainousooking portugee delgado apparently in the worst of tempers and surrounded by a number of equally villainousooking arab sailors clad in dirty white in front was the captain of the port a wellnown and esteemed gentleman of the name of cato like myself a small man who had gone through many adventures accompanied by some attendants he was seated on the afterkylight smoking with his eyes fixed upon stephen and the portugee glad to see you quatermain he said there s some row on here but i have only just arrived and don t understand portuguese and the gentleman on the capstan won t leave it to explain what s up stephen i asked after shaking mr cato by the hand what s up replied somers this man and he pointed to delgado wanted to sneak out to sea with all our goods that s all to say nothing of me and sammy whom no doubt he have chucked overboard as soon as he was out of sight of land however sammy who knows portuguese overheard his little plans and as you see i objected well delgado was asked for his version of the affair and as i expected explained that he only intended to get a little nearer to the bar and there wait till we arrived of course he lied and knew that we were aware of the fact and that his intention had been to slip out to sea with all our valuable property which he would sell after having murdered or marooned stephen and the poor cook but as nothing could be proved and we were now in strong enough force to look after ourselves and our belongings i did not see the use of pursuing the argument so i accepted the explanation with a smile and asked everybody to join in a morning nip afterwards stephen told me that while i was engaged with mavovo on the previous night a message had reached him from sammy who was on board the ship in charge of our belongings saying that he would be glad of some company knowing the cook s nervous nature fortunately enough he made up his mind at once to go and sleep upon the maria in the morning trouble arose as sammy had told me what he did not tell me was that he was not knocked overboard as he said but took to the water of his own accord when complications with delgado appeared imminent i understand the position i said and all s well that ends well but it s lucky you thought of coming on board to sleep after this everything went right i sent some of the men back in the charge of stephen for our remaining effects which they brought safely aboard and in the evening we sailed our voyage up to kilwa was beautiful a gentle breeze driving us forward over a sea so calm that not even hans who i think was one of the worst sailors in the world or the zulu hunters were really sick though as sammy put it they declined their food i think it was on the fifth night of our voyage or it may have been the seventh that we anchored one afternoon off the island of kilwa not very far from the old portuguese fort delgado with whom we had little to do during the passage hoisted some queer sort of signal in response a boat came off containing what he called the port officials a band of cuthroat desperateooking black fellows in charge of a pockarked elderly halfreed who was introduced to us as the bey hassanenohammed that mr hassanenohammed entirely disapproved of our presence on the ship and especially of our proposed landing at kilwa was evident to me from the moment that i set eyes upon his illavoured countenance after a hurried conference with delgado he came forward and addressed me in arabic of which i could not understand a word luckily however sam the cook who as i think i said was a great linguist had a fair acquaintance with this tongue acquired it appears while at the zanzibar hotel so not trusting delgado i called on him to interpret what is he saying sammy i asked he began to talk to hassan and replied presently sir he makes you many compliments he says that he has heard what a great man who are from his friend delgado also that you and mr somers are english a nation which he adores does he i exclaimed i should never have thought it from his looks thank him for his kind remarks and tell him that we are going to land here and march up country to shoot sammy obeyed and the conversation went on somewhat as follows with all humility i i e hassa request you not to land this country is not a fit place for such noble gentlemen there is nothing to eat and no head of game has been seen for years the people in the interior are savages of the worst sort whom hunger has driven to take to cannibalism i would not have your blood upon my head i beg of you therefore to go on in this ship to delagoa bay where you will find a good hotel or to any other place you may select a q might i ask you noble sir what is your position at kilwa that you consider yourself responsible for our safety h honoured english lord i am a trader here of portuguese nationality but born of an arab mother of high birth and brought up among that people i have gardens on the mainland tended by my native servants who are as children to me where i grow palms and cassava and ground nuts and plantains and many other kinds of produce all the tribes in this district look upon me as their chief and venerated father a q then noble hassan you will be able to pass us through them seeing that we are peaceful hunters who wish to harm no one a long consultation between hassan and delgado during which i ordered mavovo to bring his zulus on deck with their guns h honoured english lord i cannot allow you to land a q noble son of the prophet i intend to land with my friend my followers my donkeys and my goods early toorrow morning if i can do so with your leave i shall be glad if not and i glanced at the fierce group of hunters behind me h honoured english lord i shall be grieved to use force but let me tell you that in my peaceful village ashore i have at least a hundred men armed with rifles whereas here i see under twenty a q after reflection and a few words with stephen somers can you tell me noble sir if from your peaceful village you have yet sighted the english manfar crocodile i mean the steamer that is engaged in watching for the dhows of wicked slavers a letter from her captain informed me that he would be in these waters by yesterday perhaps however he has been delayed for a day or two if i had exploded a bomb at the feet of the excellent hassan its effect could scarcely have been more remarkable than that of this question he turned ot pale but a horrible yellow and exclaimed english manfar crocodile i thought she had gone to aden to refit and would not be back at zanzibar for four months a q you have been misinformed noble hassan she will not refit till october shall i read you the letter and i produced a piece of paper from my pocket it may be interesting since my friend the captain whom you remember is named flowers mentions you in it he says hassan waved his hand it is enough i see honoured lord that you are a man of mettle not easily to be turned from your purpose in the name of god the compassionate land and go wheresoever you like a q i think that i had almost rather wait until the crocodile comes in h land land captain delgado get up the cargo and man your boat mine too is at the service of these lords you captain will like to get away by this night s tide there is still light lord quatermain and such hospitality as i can offer is at your service a q ah i knew bey hassan that you were only joking with me when you said that you wished us to go elsewhere an excellent jest truly from one whose hospitality is so famous well to fall in with your wishes we will come ashore this evening and if the captain delgado chances to sight the queen s ship crocodile before he sails perhaps he will be so good as to signal to us with a rocket certainly certainly interrupted delgado who up to this time had pretended that he understood no english the tongue in which i was speaking to the interpreter sammy then he turned and gave orders to his arab crew to bring up our belongings from the hold and to lower the maria s boat never did i see goods transferred in quicker time within half an hour every one of our packages was off that ship for stephen somers kept a count of them our personal baggage went into the maria s boat and the goods together with the four donkeys which were lowered on to the top of them were rumbled pellell into the bargeike punt belonging to hassan here also i was accommodated with about half of our people the rest taking their seats in the smaller boat under the charge of stephen at length all was ready and we cast off farewell captain i cried to delgado if you should sight the crocodile at this point delgado broke into such a torrent of bad language in portuguese arabic and english that i fear the rest of my remarks never reached him as we rowed shorewards i observed that hans who was seated near to me under the stomach of a jackass was engaged in sniffing at the sides and bottom of the barge as a dog might do and asked him what he was about very odd smell in this boat he whispered back in dutch it stinks of kaffir man just like the hold of the maria i think this boat is used to carry slaves be quiet i whispered back and stop nosing at those planks but to myself i thought hans is right we are in a nest of slaveraders and this hassan is their leader we rowed past the island on which i observed the ruins of an old portuguese fort and some long grassoofed huts where i reflected the slaves were probably kept until they could be shipped away observing my glance fixed upon these hassan hastened to explain through sammy that they were storehouses in which he dried fish and hides and kept goods how interesting i answered further south we dry hides in the sun crossing a narrow channel we arrived at a rough jetty where we disembarked whence we were led by hassan not to the village which i now saw upon our left but to a pleasantooking though dilapidated house that stood a hundred yards from the shore something about the appearance of this house impressed me with the idea that it was never built by slavers the whole look of the place with its verandah and garden suggested taste and civilisation evidently educated people had designed it and resided here i glanced about me and saw amidst a grove of neglected orange trees that were surrounded with palms of some age the ruins of a church about this there was no doubt for there surmounted by a stone cross was a little pentouse in which still hung the bell that once summoned the worshippers to prayer tell the english lord said hassan to sammy that these buildings were a mission station of the christians who abandoned them more than twenty years ago when i came here i found them empty indeed i answered and what were the names of those who dwelt in them i never heard said hassan they had been gone a long while when i came then we went up to the house and for the next hour and more were engaged with our baggage which was piled in a heap in what had been the garden and in unpacking and pitching two tents for the hunters which i caused to be placed immediately in front of the rooms that were assigned to us those rooms were remarkable in their way mine had evidently been a sitting chamber as i judged from some such broken articles of furniture that appeared to be of american make that which stephen occupied had once served as a sleepinglace for the bedstead of iron still remained there also there were a hanging bookcase now fallen and some tattered remnants of books one of these that oddly enough was wellreserved perhaps because the white ants or other creatures did not like the taste of its morocco binding was a keble s christian year on the titleage of which was written to my dearest elizabeth on her birthday from her husband i took the liberty to put it in my pocket on the wall moreover still hung the small watercolour picture of a very pretty young woman with fair hair and blue eyes in the corner of which picture was written in the same handwriting as that in the book elizabeth aged twenty this also i annexed thinking that it might come in useful as a piece of evidence looks as if the owners of this place had left it in a hurry quatermain said stephen that s it my boy or perhaps they didn t leave perhaps they stopped here murdered i nodded and said i dare say friend hassan could tell us something about the matter meanwhile as supper isn t ready yet let us have a look at that church while it is light we walked through the palm and orange grove to where the building stood finely placed upon a mound it was wellonstructed of a kind of coral rock and a glance showed us that it had been gutted by fire the discoloured walls told their own tale the interior was now full of shrubs and creepers and an ugly yellowish snake glided from what had been the stone altar without the graveyard was enclosed by a broken wall only we could see no trace of graves near the gateway however was a rough mound if we could dig into that i said i expect we should find the bones of the people who inhabited this place does that suggest anything to you stephen nothing except that they were probably killed you should learn to draw inferences it is a useful art especially in africa it suggests to me that if you are right the deed was not done by natives who would never take the trouble to bury the dead arabs on the contrary might do so especially if there were any bastard portuguese among them who called themselves christians but whatever happened must have been a long while ago and i pointed to a selfown hardwood tree growing from the mound which could scarcely have been less than twenty years old we returned to the house to find that our meal was ready hassan had asked us to dine with him but for obvious reasons i preferred that sammy should cook our food and that he should dine with us he appeared full of compliments though i could see hate and suspicion in his eye and we fell to on the kid that we had bought from him for i did not wish to accept any gifts from this fellow our drink was squareace gin mixed with water that i sent hans to fetch with his own hands from the stream that ran by the house lest otherwise it should be drugged at first hassan like a good mohammedan refused to touch any spirits but as the meal went on he politely relented upon this point and i poured him out a liberal tot the appetite comes in eating as the frenchman said and the same thing applies to drinking so at least it was in hassan s case who probably thought that the quantity swallowed made no difference to his sin after the third dose of squareace he grew quite amiable and talkative thinking the opportunity a good one i sent for sammy and through him told our host that we were anxious to hire twenty porters to carry our packages he declared that there was not such a thing as a porter within a hundred miles whereon i gave him some more gin the end of it was that we struck a bargain i forget for how much he promising to find us twenty good men who were to stay with us for as long as we wanted them then i asked him about the destruction of the mission station but although he was halfrunk on this point he remained very close all he would say was that he had heard that twenty years ago the people called the mazitu who were very fierce had raided right down to the coast and killed those who dwelt there except a white man and his wife who had fled inland and never been seen again how many of them were buried in that mound by the church i asked quickly who told you they were buried there he replied with a start but seeing his mistake went on i do not know what you mean i never heard of anyone being buried sleep well honoured lords i must go and see to the loading of my goods upon the maria then rising he salaamed and walked or rather rolled away so the maria hasn t sailed after all i said and whistled in a certain fashion instantly hans crept into the room out of the darkness for this was my signal to him hans i said i hear sounds upon that island slip down to the shore and spy out what is happening no one will see you if you are careful no baas he answered with a grin i do not think that anyone will see hans if he is careful especially at night and he slid away as quietly as he had come now i went out and spoke to mavovo telling him to keep a good watch and to be sure that every man had his gun ready as i thought that these people were slaveraders and might attack us in the night in that event i said they were to fall back upon the stoep but not to fire until i gave the word good my father he answered this is a lucky journey i never thought there would be hope of war so soon my snake forgot to mention it the other night sleep safe macumazana nothing that walks shall reach you while we live don t be so sure i answered and we lay down in the bedroom with our clothes on and our rifles by our sides the next thing i remember was someone shaking me by the shoulder i thought it was stephen who had agreed to keep awake for the first part of the night and to call me at one in the morning indeed he was awake for i could see the glow from the pipe he smoked baas whispered the voice of hans i have found out everything they are loading the maria with slaves taking them in big boats from the island so i answered but how did you get here are the hunters asleep without he chuckled no they are not asleep they look with all their eyes and listen with all their ears yet old hans passed through them even the baas somers did not hear him that i didn t said stephen thought a rat was moving no more i stepped through the place where the door had been on to the stoep by the light of the fire which the hunters had lit without i could see mavovo sitting wide awake his gun upon his knees and beyond him two sentries i called him and pointed to hans see i said what good watchmen you are when one can step over your heads and enter my room without your knowing it mavovo looked at the hottentot and felt his clothes and boots to see whether they were wet with the night dew ow he exclaimed in a surly voice i said that nothing which walks could reach you macumazana but this yellow snake has crawled between us on his belly look at the new mud that stains his waistcoat yet snakes can bite and kill answered hans with a snigger oh you zulus think that you are very brave and shout and flourish spears and battleaxes one poor hottentot dog is worth a whole impi of you after all no don t try to strike me mavovo the warrior since we both serve the same master in our separate ways when it comes to fighting i will leave the matter to you but when it is a case of watching or spying do you leave it to hans look here mavovo and he opened his hand in which was a horn snuffox such as zulus sometimes carry in their ears to whom does this belong it is mine said mavovo and you have stolen it yes jeered hans it is yours also i stole it from your ear as i passed you in the dark don t you remember that you thought a gnat had tickled you and hit up at your face it is true growled mavovo and you snake of a hottentot are great in your own low way yet next time anything tickles me i shall strike not with my hand but with a spear then i turned them both out remarking to stephen that this was a good example of the eternal fight between courage and cunning after this as i was sure that hassan and his friends were too busy to interfere with us that night we went to bed and slept the sleep of the just when i got up the next morning i found that stephen somers had already risen and gone out nor did he appear until i was half through my breakfast where on earth have you been i asked noting that his clothes were torn and covered with wet moss up the tallest of those palm trees quatermain saw an arab climbing one of them with a rope and got another arab to teach me the trick it isn t really difficult though it looks alarming what in the name of goodness i began oh he interrupted my ruling passion looking through the glasses i thought i caught sight of an orchid growing near the crown so went up it wasn t an orchid after all only a mass of yellow pollen but i learned something for my pains sitting in the top of that palm i saw the maria working out from under the lee of the island also far away i noted a streak of smoke and watching it through the glasses made out what looked to me uncommonly like a manfar steaming slowly along the coast in fact i am sure it was and english too then the mist came up and i lost sight of them my word i said that will be the crocodile what i told our host hassan was not altogether bunkum mr cato the port officer at durban mentioned to me that the crocodile was expected to call there within the next fortnight to take in stores after a slaveunting cruise down the coast now it would be odd if she chanced to meet the maria and asked to have a look at her cargo wouldn t it not at all quatermain for unless one or the other of them changes her course that is just what she must do within the next hour or so and i jolly well hope she will i haven t forgiven that beast delgado the trick he tried to play on us by slipping away with our goods to say nothing of those poor devils of slaves pass the coffee will you for the next ten minutes we ate in silence for stephen had an excellent appetite and was hungry after his morning climb just as we finished our meal hassan appeared looking even more villainous than he had done the previous day i saw also that he was in a truculent mood induced perhaps by the headache from which he was evidently suffering as a result of his potations or perhaps the fact that the maria had got safe away with the slaves as he imagined unobserved by us was the cause of the change of his demeanour a third alternative may have been that he intended to murder us during the previous night and found no safe opportunity of carrying out his amiable scheme we saluted him courteously but without salaaming in reply he asked me bluntly through sammy when we intended to be gone as such christian dogs defiled his house which he wanted for himself i answered as soon as the twenty bearers whom he had promised us appeared but not before you lie he said i never promised you bearers i have none here do you mean that you shipped them all away in the maria with the slaves last night i asked sweetly my reader have you ever taken note of the appearance and proceedings of a tomat of established age and morose disposition when a little dog suddenly disturbs it on the prowl have you observed how it contorts itself into arched but unnatural shapes how it swells visibly to almost twice its normal size how its hair stands up and its eyes flash and the stream of unmentionable language that proceeds from its open mouth if so you will have a very good idea of the effect produced upon hassan by this remark of mine the fellow looked as though he were going to burst with rage he rolled about his bloodshot eyes seemed to protrude he cursed us horribly he put his hand upon the hilt of the great knife he wore and finally he did what the tomat does he spat now stephen was standing with me looking as cool as a cucumber and very much amused and being as it chanced a little nearer to hassan than i was received the full benefit of this rude proceeding my word didn t it wake him up he said something strong and the next second flew at the halfreed like a tiger landing him a beauty straight upon the nose back staggered hassan drawing his knife as he did so but stephen s left in the eye caused him to drop it as he dropped himself i pounced upon the knife and since it was too late to interfere for the mischief had been done let things take their course and held back the zulus who had rushed up at the noise hassan rose and to do him credit came on like a man head down his great skull caught stephen who was the lighter of the two in the chest and knocked him over but before the arab could follow up the advantage he was on his feet again then ensued a really glorious mill hassan fought with head and fists and feet stephen with fists alone dodging his opponent s rushes he gave it to him as he passed and soon his coolness and silence began to tell once he was knocked over by a hooked one under the jaw but in the next round he sent the arab literally flying head over heels oh how those zulus cheered and i too danced with delight up hassan came again spitting out several teeth and adopting new tactics grabbed stephen round the middle to and fro they swung the arab trying to kick the englishman with his knees and to bite him also till the pain reminded him of the absence of his front teeth once he nearly got him down early but not quite for the collar by which he had gripped him his object was to strangl burst and at that juncture hassan s turban fell over his face blinding him for a moment then stephen gripped him round the middle with his left arm and with his right pommelled him unmercifully till he sank in a sitting position to the ground and held up his hand in token of surrender the noble english lord has beaten me he gasped apologise yelled stephen picking up a handful of mud or i shove this down your dirty throat he seemed to understand at any rate he bowed till his forehead touched the ground and apologised very thoroughly now that is over i said cheerfully to him so how about those bearers i have no bearers he answered you dirty liar i exclaimed one of my people has been down to your village there and says it is full of men then go and take them for yourself he replied viciously for he knew that the place was stockaded now i was in a fix it was all very well to give a slaveealer the thrashing he deserved but if he chose to attack us with his arabs we should be in a poor way watching me with the eye that was not bunged up hassan guessed my perplexity i have been beaten like a dog he said his rage returning to him with his breath but god is compassionate and just he will avenge in due time the words had not left his lips for one second when from somewhere out at sea there floated the sullen boom of a great gun at this moment too an arab rushed up from the shore crying where is the bey hassan here i said pointing at him the arab stared until i thought his eyes would drop out for the bey hassan was indeed a sight to see then he gabbled in a frightened voice captain an english manfar is chasing the maria boom went the great gun for the second time hassan said nothing but his jaw dropped and i saw that he had lost exactly three teeth that is the crocodile i remarked slowly causing sammy to translate and as i spoke produced from my inner pocket a union jack which i had placed there after i heard that the ship was sighted stephen i went on as i shook it out if you have got your wind would you mind climbing up that palm tree again and signalling with this to the crocodile out at sea by george that s a good idea said stephen whose jovial face although swollen was now again wreathed in smiles hans bring me a long stick and a bit of string but hassan did not think it at all a good idea english lord he gasped you shall have the bearers i will go to fetch them no you won t i said you will stop here as a hostage send that man hassan uttered some rapid orders and the messenger sped away this time towards the stockaded village on the right as he went another messenger arrived who also stared amazedly at the condition of his chief bey f you are the bey he said in a doubtful voice for by now the amiable face of hassan had begun to swell and colour with the telescope we have seen that the english manfar has sent a boat and boarded the maria god is great muttered the discomfited hassan and delgado who is a thief and a traitor from his mother s breast will tell the truth the english sons of satan will land here all is finished nothing is left but flight bid the people fly into the bush and take the slaves mean their servants i will join them no you won t i interrupted through sammy at any rate not at present you will come with us the miserable hassan reflected then he asked lord quatermain i remember the title because it is the nearest i ever got or am likely to get to the peerag if i furnish you with the twenty bearers and accompany you for some days on your journey inland will you promise not to signal to your countrymen on the ship and bring them ashore what do you think i asked of stephen oh he answered i think i agree this scoundrel has had a pretty good dusting and if once the crocodile people land there be an end of our expedition as sure as eggs are eggs they will carry us off to zanzibar or somewhere to give evidence before a slave court also nothing will be gained for by the time the sailors get here all these rascals will have bolted except our friend hassan you see it isn t as though we were sure he would be hung he probably escape after all international law subject of a foreign power no direct proof hat kind of thing you know give me a minute or two i said and began to reflect very deeply whilst i was thus engaged several things happened i saw twenty natives being escorted towards us doubtless the bearers who had been promised also i saw many others accompanied by other natives flying from the village into the bush lastly a third messenger arrived who announced that the maria was sailing away apparently in charge of a prizerew and that the manfar was putting about as though to accompany her evidently she had no intention of effecting a landing upon what was nominally at any rate portuguese territory therefore if anything was to be done we must act at once well the end of it was that like a fool i accepted stephen s advice and did nothing always the easiest course and generally that which leads to most trouble ten minutes afterwards i changed my mind but then it was too late the crocodile was out of signalling distance this was subsequent to a conversation with hans baas said that worthy in his leery fashion i think you have made a mistake you forget that these yellow devils in white robes who have run away will come back again and that when you return from up country they may be waiting for you now if the english manfar had destroyed their town and their slaveheds they might have gone somewhere else however he added as an afterthought glancing at the disfigured hassan we have their captain and of course you mean to hang him baas or if you don t like to leave it to me i can hang men very well once when i was young i helped the executioner at cape town get out i said but nevertheless i knew that hans was right chapter the slave road the twenty bearers having arrived in charge of five or six arabs armed with guns we went to inspect them taking hassan with us also the hunters they were a likely lot of men though rather thin and scaredooking and evidently as i could see from their physical appearance and varying methods of dressing the hair members of different tribes having delivered them the arabs or rather one of them entered into excited conversation with hassan as sammy was not at hand i do not know what was said although i gathered that they were contemplating his rescue if so they gave up the idea and began to run away as their companions had done one of them however a bolder fellow than the rest turned and fired at me he missed by some yards as i could tell from the sing of the bullet for these arabs are execrable shots still his attempt at murder irritated me so much that i determined he should not go scotree i was carrying the little rifle called intombi that with which as hans had reminded me i shot the vultures at dingaan s kraal many years before of course i could have killed the man but this i did not wish to do or i could have shot him through the leg but then we should have had to nurse him or leave him to die so i selected his right arm which was outstretched as he fled and at about fifty paces put a bullet through it just above the elbow there i said to the zulus as i saw it double up that low fellow will never shoot at anyone again pretty macumazana very pretty said mavovo but as you can aim so well why not have chosen his head that bullet is halfasted next i set to work to get into communication with the bearers who thought poor devils that they had been but sold to a new master here i may explain that they were slaves not meant for exportation but men kept to cultivate hassan s gardens fortunately i found that two of them belonged to the mazitu people who it may be remembered are of the same blood as the zulus although they separated from the parent stock generations ago these men talked a dialect that i could understand though at first not very easily the foundation of it was zulu but it had become much mixed with the languages of other tribes whose women the mazitu had taken to wife also there was a man who could speak some bastard arabic sufficiently well for sammy to converse with him i asked the mazitus if they knew the way back to their country they answered yes but it was far off a full month s journey i told them that if they would guide us thither they should receive their freedom and good pay adding that if the other men served us well they also should be set free when we had done with them on receiving this information the poor wretches smiled in a sickly fashion and looked at hassanenohammed who glowered at them and us from the box on which he was seated in charge of mavovo how can we be free while that man lives their look seemed to say as though to confirm their doubts hassan who understood or guessed what was passing asked by what right we were promising freedom to his slaves by right of that i answered pointing to the union jack which stephen still had in his hand also we will pay you for them when we return according as they have served us yes he muttered you will pay me for them when you return or perhaps before that englishman it was three o clock in the afternoon before we were able to make a start there was so much to be arranged that it might have been wiser to wait till the morrow had we not determined that if we could help it nothing would induce us to spend another night in that place blankets were served out to each of the bearers who poor naked creatures seemed quite touched at the gift of them the loads were apportioned having already been packed at durban in cases such as one man could carry the pack saddles were put upon the four donkeys which proved to be none the worse for their journey and burdens to a weight of about lbs each fixed on them in waterproof hide bags besides cooking calabashes and sleeping mats which hans produced from somewhere probably he stole them out of the deserted village but as they were necessary to us i confess i asked no questions lastly six or eight goats which were wandering about were captured to take with us for food till we could find game for these i offered to pay hassan but when i handed him the money he threw it down in a rage so i picked it up and put it in my pocket again with a clear conscience at length everything was more or less ready and the question arose as to what was to be done with hassan the zulus like hans wished to kill him as sammy explained to him in his best arabic then this murderous fellow showed what a coward he was at heart he flung himself upon his knees he wept he invoked us in the name of the compassionate allah who he explained was after all the same god that we worshipped till mavovo growing impatient of the noise threatened him with his kerry whereon he became silent the easyatured stephen was for letting him go a plan that seemed to have advantages for then at least we should be rid of his abominable company after reflection however i decided that we had better take him along with us at any rate for a day or so to hold as a hostage in case the arabs should follow and attack us at first he refused to stir but the assegai of one of the zulu hunters pressed gently against what remained of his robe furnished an argument that he could not resist at length we were off i with the two guides went ahead then came the bearers then half of the hunters then the four donkeys in charge of hans and sammy then hassan and the rest of the hunters except mavovo who brought up the rear with stephen needless to say all our rifles were loaded and generally we were prepared for any emergency the only path that which the guides said we must follow ran by the seashore for a few hundred yards and then turned inland through hassan s village where he lived for it seemed that the old mission house was not used by him as we marched along a little rocky cliff t was not more than ten feet high here a deepater channel perhaps fifty yards in breadth separated the mainland from the island whence the slaves had been loaded on to the maria some difficulty arose about the donkeys one of these slipped its load and another began to buck and evinced an inclination to leap into the sea with its precious burden the rearguard of hunters ran to get hold of it when suddenly there was a splash the brute s in i thought to myself till a shout told me that not the ass but hassan had departed over the cliff s edge watching his opportunity and being it was clear a firstate swimmer he had flung himself backwards in the midst of the confusion and falling into deep water promptly dived about twenty yards from the shore he came up for a moment then dived again heading for the island i dare say i could have potted him through the head with a snap shot but somehow i did not like to kill a man swimming for his life as though he were a hippopotamus or a crocodile moreover the boldness of the manoeuvre appealed to me so i refrained from firing and called to the others to do likewise as our late host approached the shore of the island i saw arabs running down the rocks to help him out of the water either they had not left the place or had reccupied it as soon as h s crocodile had vanished with her prize as it was clear that to recapture hassan would involve an attack upon the garrison of the island which we were in no position to carry out i gave orders for the march to be resumed these the difficulty with the donkey having been overcome were obeyed at once it was fortunate that we did not delay for scarcely had the caravan got into motion when the arabs on the island began to fire at us luckily no one was hit and we were soon round a point and under cover also their shooting was as bad as usual one missile however it was a poteg struck a donkeyoad and smashed a bottle of good brandy and a tin of preserved butter this made me angry so motioning to the others to proceed i took shelter behind a tree and waited till a torn and dirty turban which i recognised as that of hassan poked up above a rock well i put a bullet through that turban for i saw the thing fly but unfortunately not through the head beneath it having left this p p card on our host i bolted from the rock and caught up the others presently we passed round the village through it i would not go for fear of an ambuscade it was quite a big place enclosed with a strong fence but hidden from the sea by a rise in the intervening land in the centre was a large easternooking house where doubtless hassan dwelt with his harem after we had gone a little way further to my astonishment i saw flames breaking out from the palmeaf roof of this house at the time i could not imagine how this happened but when a day or two later i observed hans wearing a pair of large and very handsome gold pendants in his ears and a gold bracelet on his wrist and found that he and one of the hunters were extremely well set up in the matter of british sovereigns ell i had my doubts in due course the truth came out he and the hunter an adventurous spirit slipped through a gate in the fence without being observed ran across the deserted village to the house stole the ornaments and money from the women s apartments and as they departed fired the place in exchange for the bottle of good brandy as hans explained i was inclined to be angry but after all as we had been fired on hans s exploit became an act of war rather than a theft so i made him and his companion divide the gold equally with the rest of the hunters who no doubt had kept their eyes conveniently shut not forgetting sammy and said no more they netted apiece which pleased them very much in addition to this i gave each or rather goods to that value to the bearers as their share of the loot hassan i remarked was evidently a great agriculturist for the gardens which he worked by slave labour were beautiful and must have brought him in a large revenue passing through these gardens we came to sloping land covered with bush here the track was not too good for the creepers hampered our progress indeed i was very glad when towards sunset we reached the crest of a hill and emerged upon a tableland which was almost clear of trees and rose gradually till it met the horizon in that bush we might easily have been attacked but in this open country i was not so much afraid since the loss to the arabs would have been great before we were overpowered as a matter of fact although spies dogged us for days no assault was ever attempted finding a convenient place by a stream we camped for the night but as it was so fine did not pitch the tents afterwards i was sorry that we had not gone further from the water since the mosquitoes bred by millions in the marshes bordering the stream gave us a dreadful time on poor stephen fresh from england they fell with peculiar ferocity with the result that in the morning what between the bruises left by hassan and their bites he was a spectacle for men and angels another thing that broke our rest was the necessity of keeping a strict watch in case the slaveraders should elect to attack us in the hours of darkness also to guard against the possibility of our bearers running away and perhaps stealing the goods it is true that before they went to sleep i explained to them very clearly that any of them who attempted to give us the slip would certainly be seen and shot whereas if they remained with us they would be treated with every kindness they answered through the two mazitu that they had nowhere to go and did not wish to fall again into the power of hassan of whom they spoke literally with shudders pointing the while to their scarred backs and the marks of the slave yokes upon their necks their protestations seemed and indeed proved to be sincere but of this of course we could not then be sure as i was engaged at sunrise in making certain that the donkeys had not strayed and generally that all was well i noted through the thin mist a little white object which at first i thought was a small bird sitting on an upright stick about fifty yards from the camp i went towards it and discovered that it was not a bird but a folded piece of paper stuck in a cleft wand such as natives often use for the carrying of letters i opened the paper and with great difficulty for the writing within was bad portuguese read as follows english devils o not think that you have escaped me i know where you are going and if you live through the journey it will be but to die at my hands after all i tell you that i have at my command three hundred brave men armed with guns who worship allah and thirst for the blood of christian dogs with these i will follow and if you fall into my hands alive you shall learn what it is to die by fire or pinned over anteaps in the sun let us see if your english manfar will help you then or your false god either misfortune go with you whitekinned robbers of honest men this pleasing epistle was unsigned but its anonymous author was not hard to identify i showed it to stephen who was so infuriated at its contents that he managed to dab some ammonia with which he was treating his mosquito bites into his eye when at length the pain was soothed by bathing we concocted this answer murderer known among men as hassanenohammed ruly we sinned in not hanging you when you were in our power oh wolf who grows fat upon the blood of the innocent this is a fault that we shall not commit again your death is near to you and we believe at our hands come with all your villains whenever you will the more there are of them the better we shall be pleased who would rather rid the world of many fiends than of a few till we meet again allan quatermain stephen somers neat if not christian i said when i had read the letter over yes replied stephen but perhaps just a little bombastic in tone if that gentleman did arrive with three hundred armed men h then my boy i answered in this way or in that we shall thrash him i don t often have an inspiration but i ve got one now and it is to the effect that mr hassan has not very long to live and that we shall be intimately connected with his end wait till you have seen a slave caravan and you will understand my feelings also i know these gentry that little prophecy of ours will get upon his nerves and give him a foretaste of things hans go and set this letter in that cleft stick the postman will call for it before long as it happened within a few days we did see a slave caravan some of the merchandise of the estimable hassan we had been making good progress through a beautiful and healthy country steering almost due west or rather a little to the north of west the land was undulating and rich wellatered and only bushlad in the neighbourhood of the streams the higher ground being open of a parkike character and dotted here and there with trees it was evident that once and not very long ago the population had been dense for we came to the remains of many villages or rather towns with large marketlaces now however these were burned with fire or deserted or occupied only by a few old bodies who got a living from the overgrown gardens these poor people who sat desolate and crooning in the sun or perhaps worked feebly at the once fertile fields would fly screaming at our approach for to them men armed with guns must of necessity be slaveraders still from time to time we contrived to catch some of them and through one member of our party or the other to get at their stories really it was all one story the slaving arabs on this pretext or on that had set tribe against tribe then they sided with the stronger and conquered the weaker by aid of their terrible guns killing out the old folk and taking the young men women and children except the infants whom they butchere to be sold as slaves it seemed that the business had begun about twenty years before when hassanenohammed and his companions arrived at kilwa and drove away the missionary who had built a station there at first this trade was extremely easy and profitable since the raw material lay near at hand in plenty by degrees however the neighbouring communities had been worked out countless numbers of them were killed while the pick of the population passed under the slave yoke and those of them who survived vanished in ships to unknown lands thus it came about that the slavers were obliged to go further afield and even to conduct their raids upon the borders of the territory of the great mazitu people the inland race of zulu origin of whom i have spoken according to our informants it was even rumoured that they proposed shortly to attack these mazitus in force relying on their guns to give them the victory and open to them a new and almost inexhaustible store of splendid human merchandise meanwhile they were cleaning out certain small tribes which hitherto had escaped them owing to the fact that they had their residence in bush or among difficult hills the track we followed was the recognised slave road of this we soon became aware by the numbers of skeletons which we found lying in the tall grass at its side some of them with heavy slaveticks still upon their wrists these i suppose had died from exhaustion but others as their split skulls showed had been disposed of by their captors on the eighth day of our march we struck the track of a slave caravan it had been travelling towards the coast but for some reason or other had turned back this may have been because its leaders had been warned of the approach of our party or perhaps they had heard that another caravan which was at work in a different district was drawing near bringing its slaves with it and wished to wait for its arrival in order that they might join forces the spoor of these people was easy to follow first we found the body of a boy of about ten then vultures revealed to us the remains of two young men one of whom had been shot and the other killed by a blow from an axe their corpses were roughly hidden beneath some grass i know not why a mile or two further on we heard a child wailing and found it by following its cries it was a little girl of about four who had been pretty though now she was but a living skeleton when she saw us she scrambled away on all fours like a monkey stephen followed her while i sick at heart went to get a tin of preserved milk from our stores presently i heard him call to me in a horrified voice rather reluctantly for i knew that he must have found something dreadful i pushed my way through the bush to where he was there bound to the trunk of a tree sat a young woman evidently the mother of the child for it clung to her leg thank god she was still living though she must have died before another day dawned we cut her loose and the zulu hunters who are kind folk enough when they are not at war carried her to camp in the end with much trouble we saved the lives of that mother and child i sent for the two mazitus with whom i could by now talk fairly well and asked them why the slavers did these things they shrugged their shoulders and one of them answered with a rather dreadful laugh because chief these arabs being blackearted kill those who can walk no more or tie them up to die if they let them go they might recover and escape and it makes the arabs sad that those who have been their slaves should live to be free and happy does it does it indeed exclaimed stephen with a snort of rage that reminded me of his father well if ever i get a chance i make them sad with a vengeance stephen was a tenderearted young man and for all his soft and indolent ways an awkward customer when roused within fortyight hours he got his chance thus that day we camped early for two reasons the first was that the woman and child we had rescued wee so weak they could not walk without rest and we had no men to spare to carry them the second that we came to an ideal spot to pass the night it was as usual a deserted village through which ran a beautiful stream of water here we took possession of some outlying huts with a fence round them and as mavovo had managed to shoot a fat eland cow and her halfrown calf we prepared to have a regular feast whilst sammy was making some broth for the rescued woman and stephen and i smoked our pipes and watched him hans slipped through the broken gate of the thorn fence or boma and announced that arabs were coming two lots of them with many slaves we ran out to look and saw that as he had said two caravans were approaching or rather had reached the village but at some distance from us and were now camping on what had once been the marketlace one of these was that whose track we had followed although during the last few hours of our march we had struck away from it chiefly because we could not bear such sights as i have described it seemed to comprise about two hundred and fifty slaves and over forty guards all black men carrying guns and most of them by their dress arabs or bastard arabs in the second caravan which approached from another direction were not more than one hundred slaves and about twenty or thirty captors now i said let us eat our dinner and then if you like we will go to call upon those gentlemen just to show that we are not afraid of them hans get the flag and tie it to the top of that tree it will show them to what country we belong up went the union jack duly and presently through our glasses we saw the slavers running about in a state of excitement also we saw the poor slaves turn and stare at the bit of flapping bunting and then begin to talk to each other it struck me as possible that someone among their number had seen a union jack in the hands of an english traveller or had heard of it as flying upon ships or at points on the coast and what it meant to slaves or they may have understood some of the remarks of the arabs which no doubt were pointed and explanatory at any rate they turned and stared till the arabs ran among them with sjambocks that is whips of hippopotamus hide and suppressed their animated conversation with many blows at first i thought that they would break camp and march away indeed they began to make preparations to do this then abandoned the idea probably because the slaves were exhausted and there was no other water they could reach before nightfall in the end they settled down and lit cooking fires also as i observed they took precautions against attack by stationing sentries and forcing the slaves to construct a boma of thorns about their camp well said stephen when we had finished our dinner are you ready for that call no i answered i do not think that i am i have been considering things and concluded that we had better leave well alone by this time those arabs will know all the story of our dealings with their worthy master hassan for no doubt he has sent messengers to them therefore if we go to their camp they may shoot us at sight or if they receive us well they may offer hospitality and poison us or cut our throats suddenly our position might be better still it is one that i believe they would find difficult to take so in my opinion we had better stop still and await developments stephen grumbled something about my being overautious but i took no heed of him one thing i did do however sending for hans i told him to take one of the mazitu dared not risk them both for they were our guides nd another of the natives whom we had borrowed from hassan a bold fellow who knew all the local languages and creep down to the slavers camp as soon as it was quite dark there i ordered him to find out what he could and if possible to with the slaves and explain that we were their friends hans nodded for this was exactly the kind of task that appealed to him and went off to make his preparations stephen and i also made some preparations in the way of strengthening our defences building large watchires and setting sentries the night fell and hans with his companions departed stealthily as snakes the silence was intense save for the occasional wailings of the slaves which now and again broke out in bursts of melancholy sound lauaua and then died away to be followed by horrid screams as the arabs laid their lashes upon some poor wretch once too a shot was fired they have seen hans said stephen i think not i answered for if so there would have been more than one shot either it was an accident or they were murdering a slave after this nothing more happened for a long while till at length hans seemed to rise out of the ground in front of me and behind him i saw the figures of the mazitu and the other man tell your story i said baas it is this between us we have learned everything the arabs know all about you and what men you have hassan has sent them orders to kill you it is well that you did not go to visit them for certainly you would have been murdered we crept near and overheard their talk they purpose to attack us at dawn toorrow morning unless we leave this place before which they will know of as we are being watched and if so what then i asked then baas they will attack as we are making up the caravan or immediately afterwards as we begin to march indeed anything more hans yes baas these two men crept among the slaves and spoke with them they are very sad those slaves and many of them have died of heartain because they have been taken from their homes and do not know where they are going i saw one die just now a young woman she was talking to another woman and seemed quite well only tired till suddenly she said in a loud voice i am going to die that i may come back as a spirit and bewitch these devils till they are spirits too then she called upon the fetish of her tribe put her hands to her breast and fell down dead at least added hans spitting reflectively she did not fall quite down because the slavetick held her head off the ground the arabs were very angry both because she had cursed them and was dead one of them came and kicked her body and afterwards shot her little boy who was sick because the mother had cursed them but fortunately he did not see us because we were in the dark far from the fire anything more hans one thing baas these two men lent the knives you gave them to two of the boldest among the slaves that they might cut the cords of the slaveticks and the other cords with which they were tied and then pass them down the lines that their brothers might do the same but perhaps the arabs will find it out and then the mazitu and the other must lose their knives that is all has the baas a little tobacco now stephen i said when hans had gone and i had explained everything there are two courses open to us either we can try to give these gentlemen the slip at once in which case we must leave the woman and child to their fate or we can stop where we are and wait to be attacked i won t run said stephen sullenly it would be cowardly to desert that poor creature also we should have a worse chance marching remember hans said that they are watching us then you would wait to be attacked isn t there a third alternative quatermain to attack them that s the idea i said let us send for mavovo presently he came and sat down in front of us while i set out the case to him it is the fashion of my people to attack rather than to be attacked and yet my father in this case my heart is against it hans he called him inblatu a zulu word which means spotted snake that was the hottentot s kaffir nam says that there are quite sixty of the yellow dogs all armed with guns whereas we have not more than fifteen for we cannot trust the slave men also he says that they are within a strong fence and awake with spies out so that it will be difficult to surprise them but here father we are in a strong fence and cannot be surprised also men who torture and kill women and children except in war must i think be cowards and will come on faintly against good shooting if indeed they come at all therefore i say wait till the buffalo shall either charge or run but the word is with you macumazana wise watcheryight not with me your hunter speak you who are old in war and i will obey you argue well i answered also another reason comes to my mind those arab brutes may get behind the slaves of whom we should butcher a lot without hurting them stephen i think we had better see the thing through here all right quatermain only i hope that mavovo is wrong in thinking that those blackguards may change their minds and run away really young man you are becoming very bloodhirsty or an orchid grower i remarked looking at him now for my part i devoutly hope that mavovo is right for let me tell you if he isn t it may be a nasty job i ve always been peaceful enough up to the present replied stephen but the sight of those unhappy wretches of slaves with their heads cut open and of the woman tied to a tree to starve make you wish to usurp the functions of god almighty i said well it is a natural impulse and perhaps in the circumstances one that will not displease him and now as we have made up our minds what we are going to do let s get to business so that these arab gentlemen may find their breakfast ready when they come to call chapter the rush of the slaves well we did all that we could in the way of making ready after we had strengthened the thorn fence of our boma as much as possible and lit several large fires outside of it to give us light i allotted his place to each of the hunters and saw that their rifles were in order and that they had plenty of ammunition then i made stephen lie down to sleep telling him that i would wake him to watch later on this however i had no intention of doing as i wanted him to rise fresh and with a steady nerve on the occasion of his first fight as soon as i saw that his eyes were shut i sat down on a box to think to tell the truth i was not altogether happy in my mind to begin with i did not know how the twenty bearers would behave under fire they might be seized with panic and rush about in which case i determined to let them out of the boma to take their chance for panic is a catching thing a worse matter was our rather awkward position there were a good many trees round the camp among which an attacking force could take cover but what i feared much more than this or even than the reedy banks of the stream along which they could creep out of reach of our bullets was a sloping stretch of land behind us covered with thick grass and scrub and rising to a crest about two hundred yards away now if the arabs got round to this crest they would fire straight into our boma and make it untenable also if the wind were in their favour they might burn us out or attack under the clouds of smoke as a matter of fact by the special mercy of providence none of these things happened for a reason which i will explain presently in the case of a night or rather a dawn attack i have always found that hour before the sky begins to lighten very trying indeed as a rule everything that can be done is done so that one must sit idle also it is then that both the physical and the moral qualities are at their lowest ebb as is the mercury in the thermometer the night is dying the day is not yet born all nature feels the influence of that hour then bad dreams come then infants wake and call then memories of those who are lost to us arise then the hesitating soul often takes its plunge into the depths of the unknown it is not wonderful therefore that on this occasion the wheels of time drave heavily for me i knew that the morning was at hand by many signs the sleeping bearers turned and muttered in their sleep a distant lion ceased its roaring and departed to its own place an alertinded cock crew somewhere and our donkeys rose and began to pull at their tetheropes as yet however it was quite dark hans crept up to me i saw his wrinkled yellow face in the light of the watchire i smell the dawn he said and vanished again mavovo appeared his massive frame silhouetted against the blackness watcheryight the night is done he said if they come at all the enemy should soon be here saluting he too passed away into the dark and presently i heard the sounds of spearlades striking together and of rifles being cocked i went to stephen and woke him he sat up yawning muttered something about greenhouses then remembering said are those arabs coming we are in for a fight at last jolly old fellow isn t it you are a jolly old fool i answered inconsequently and marched off in a rage my mind was uneasy about this inexperienced young man if anything should happen to him what should i say to his father well in that event it was probable that something would happen to me too very possibly we should both be dead in an hour certainly i had no intention of allowing myself to be taken alive by those slaving devils hassan s remarks about fires and anteaps and the sun were too vividly impressed upon my memory in another five minutes everybody was up though it required kicks to rouse most of the bearers from their slumbers they poor men were accustomed to the presence of death and did not suffer him to disturb their sleep still i noted that they muttered together and seemed alarmed if they show signs of treachery you must kill them i said to mavovo who nodded in his grave silent fashion only we left the rescued slaveoman and her child plunged in the stupor of exhaustion in a corner of the camp what was the use of disturbing her sammy who seemed far from comfortable brought two pannikins of coffee to stephen and myself this is a momentous occasion messrs quatermain and somers he said as he gave us the coffee and i noted that his hand shook and his teeth chattered the cold is extreme he went on in his copybook english by way of explaining these physical symptoms which he saw i had observed mr quatermain it is all very well for you to paw the ground and smell the battle from afar as is written in the book of job but i was not brought up to the trade and take it otherwise indeed i wish i was back at the cape yes even within the whitewashed walls of the place of detention so do i i muttered keeping my right foot on the ground with difficulty but stephen laughed outright and asked what will you do sammy when the fighting begins mr somers
