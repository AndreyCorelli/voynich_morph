to know what it is next morning this great man opened an office in cornhill and before three olock one thousand shares had been subscribed for at ten dollars a share and the deposits paid he put the ten thousand dollars in his pocket set off the same evening for the continent and was never heard of again he had assured them that nobody would know what the undertaking was and he had kept his word the south sea stock rose in one day from per cent to and finally to per cent it then became known that sir john blount the chairman and some others had sold out making vast fortunes the price of stock began to fall and at last the crisis brought ruin to thousands the poet gay who had been given of stock and had thought himself rich lost all and was so ill in consequence that his life was in danger some men committed suicide on account of their losses and some became insane prior said i am lost in the south sea the roaring of the waves and the madness of the people are justly put together the people were now as wild with anger as they had been intoxicated with hope for gain they demanded redress and the punishment of the directors of the south sea company men high in position were thrown into the tower after it was found that the books of the company had been tampered with or destroyed and large amounts of stock used to bribe men in office the directors were fined over ten million dollars and their fortunes distributed among the sufferers sir john blount was allowed but out of a fortune of the fortune of another a million and a half pounds was given to the losers one man was treated with especial severity because he was reported to have said that he would feed his carriage horses off gold mr guy fearing that there was trickery when the stock rose so rapidly sold out when the prices were from three to six hundred and thereby saved himself from financial ruin he was now very rich having always lived economically when he was a bookseller it is said that he always ate his dinner on his counter using a newspaper for a tablecloth the following story is told by walter thornbury in his old and new london ulture hopkins so called from his alleged desire to seize upon gains and who had become rich in south sea stock once called upon mr guy to learn a lesson as he said in the art of saving being introduced into the parlor guy not knowing his visitor lighted a candle but when hopkins said ir i always thought myself perfect in the art of getting and husbanding money but being informed that you far exceed me i have taken the liberty of waiting upon you to be satisfied on this subject guy replied f that is all your business we can as well talk it over in the dark and immediately put out the candle this was evidence sufficient for hopkins who acknowledged guy to be his master and took his leave notwithstanding mr guy penuriousness he had the grace of gratitude thousands forget their helpers after prosperity comes to them not so thomas guy the saturday magazine for aug relates this incident the munificent founder of guy hospital was a man of very humble appearance and of a melancholy cast of countenance one day while pensively leaning over one of the bridges he attracted the attention and commiseration of a bystander who apprehensive that he meditated selfestruction could not refrain from addressing him with an earnest entreaty not to let his misfortunes tempt him to commit any rash act then placing in his hand a guinea with the delicacy of genuine benevolence he hastily withdrew guy roused from his revery followed the stranger and warmly expressed his gratitude but assured him that he was mistaken in supposing him to be either in distress of mind or of circumstances making an earnest request to be favored with the name of the good man his intended benefactor the address was given and they parted some years later guy observing the name of his friend in the bankrupt list hastened to his house brought to his recollection their former interview found upon investigation that no blame could be attached to him under his misfortunes intimated his ability and also his intention to serve him entered into immediate arrangements with his creditors and finally restablished him in a business which ever after prospered in his hands and in the hands of his children children for many years in newgate street those who knew mr guy best declared that his chief design in getting money seems to have been with a view of employing the same in good works he gave five guineas to mr bowyer a printer who had lost everything by fire not knowing said mr guy how soon it may be our own case he also gave in to the stationer company to be distributed to poor members and widows at the rate of per annum many of his poor though distant relations had stated allowances from him of or a year and occasionally larger sums and to two of them he gave apiece to advance them in the world he has several times given for discharging insolvent debtors he has readily given at a time on application to him on behalf of a distressed family in mr guy was asked to become the governor of st thomas hospital partly because he was a prominent and able citizen and partly because he might thus become interested and give some money mr guy accepted the office and soon built three new wards at a cost of and provided the hospital with a year for the benefit of its poor when patients left the hospital they were often unfit for work and this money would provide food for them for a time he had given already to the steward money and clothes for such cases of need he also built in a new entrance to st thomas hospital improved the front and erected two large brick houses these works costing him mr guy seems to have given constantly from his youth and always with good sense in his gifts he was growing old he probably had meditated long and carefully as to what use he should put his wealth highmore in his history of the public charities of london tells this rather improbable story for the application of this fortune to charitable uses the public are indebted to a trifling circumstance he employed a female servant whom he had agreed to marry some days previous to the intended ceremony he had ordered the pavement before his door to be mended up to a particular stone which he had marked and then left his house on business the servant in his absence looking at the workmen saw a broken stone beyond this mark which they had not repaired and on pointing to it with that design they acquainted her that mr guy had not ordered them to go so far she however directed it to be done adding with the security incidental to her expectation of soon becoming his wife ell him i bade you and he will not be angry but she soon learnt how fatal it is for one in a dependent position to exceed the limits of his or her authority for her master on his return was angered that they had gone beyond his orders renounced his engagement to his servant and devoted his ample fortune to public charity in when mr guy was seventyix years of age he leased a large piece of ground of st thomas hospital for a thousand years at a year to erect upon it a great hospital for incurables to receive and entertain therein four hundred poor persons or upwards laboring under any distempers infirmities or disorders thought capable of relief by physic or surgery but who by reason of the small hopes there may be of their cure or the length of time which for that purpose may be required or thought necessary are or may be adjudged or called incurable and as such not proper subjects to be received into or continued in the present hospital in and by which no provision has been made for distempers deemed or called incurable while mr guy had primarily in mind the poor and incurable and the insane as well in his will he directed the trustees to use their judgment about the length of time patients should remain either for life or for a short period mr guy at once procured a plan for his hospital and in the spring of laid the foundations he went to the work with all the expedition of a youth of fortune erecting a house for his own residence the original central building of stone cost the eastern wing begun in was completed at a cost of the western wing in at a cost of mr guy lived to see his treasured gift roofed in before his death which occurred dec in his eightieth year in a little more than a week afterwards jan his hospital was opened and sixty patients were admitted after the death of mr guy one thousand guineas were found in his iron chest and as it was imagined that these were placed there to defray his funeral expenses they were used for that purpose his body lay in state at mercer hall cheapside and was taken with great funeral pomp to the parish church of st thomas southwark to rest there till the chapel at the hospital should be completed two hundred blueoat boys from christ hospital walked in the procession and sang before the hearse which was followed by forty coaches each drawn by six horses mr guy had not forgotten these blueoat boys in his will and left a perpetual annuity of to educate four children yearly with preference for his own relatives the boys from christ hospital always interest tourists in london they wear long blue gowns yellow stockings and kneereeches no cover is worn on their heads even in winter this school was founded by the boy king edward for poor boys though his father henry gave the building which belonged to the grey friars to the city of london but edward caused the school to be established it is a quaint and most interesting spot where four queens and scores of lords and ladies are buried argaret second wife of edward i isabella the infamous wife of edward joan daughter of edward and wife of david bruce king of scotland and others twelve hundred boys study at the hospital lamb coleridge and other famous men were among the blueoats the latter tells some interesting things about the school in his tablealk the discipline at christ hospital in my time was ultrapartan all domestic ties were to be put aside oy i remember boyer saying to me once when i was crying the first day of my return after the holidays oy the school is your father boy the school is your mother boy the school is your brother the school is your sister the school is your first cousin and your second cousin and all the rest of your relatives let have no more crying no tongue can express good mrs boyer val le grice and i were once going to be flogged for some domestic misdeed and boyer was thundering away at us by way of prologue when mrs b looked in and said log them soundly sir i beg this saved us boyer was so nettled by the interruption that he growled out way woman away and we were let off while mr guy remembered the blueoat orphans he seemed to have remembered everybody else in his will so much were the people interested in the lengthy document with its numerous gifts that the will went through three editions the first year of its publication mr guy gave to every living relative even to distant cousins n all over these were mainly gifts of each at four per cent so that each one received a year these legacies were called guy thousands if the recipients were under age the interest was to be used for his or her education and apprenticeship one thousand pounds were given for the release of poor prisoners for debt in london middlesex or surrey in sums not to exceed five pounds each about six hundred persons were thus set at liberty another thousand pounds were left to the trustees to relieve such poor people being housekeepers as in their judgments shall be thought convenient the interest on more than was left for putting out children apprentices nursing or such like charitable deed then followed the great gift of nearly a million and a half dollars for the hospital after the buildings were erected the remainder was to be used in the purchase of lands or reversions in fee simple so that the rents might be a perpetual provision for the sick considerably over a million dollars were thus expended in purchasing over acres in essex a large estate of the duke of chandos for and other tracts of land and houses about six years after the death of the founder a bronze statue of him by scheymaker was erected in the open square in front of the hospital costing five hundred guineas on the pedestal are representations of the good samaritan christ healing the sick and mr guy armorial bearings in the chapel a marble statue of mr guy costing was erected by mr bacon in the founder is represented as holding out one hand to raise a poor invalid lying on the earth and pointing with the other hand to a person carried on a litter into one of the hospital wards on the pedestal is an inscription beginning with these words underneath are deposited the remains of thomas guy citizen of london member of parliament and the sole founder of this hospital in his lifetime in the noble john howard visited guy hospital and while he found some of the wards too low being only nine feet and a half high in the new wards he praised the iron bedsteads and hair beds as being clean and wholesome for over one hundred and seventy years guy hospital has done its noble work departments have been added for special treatment of the eye the ear the teeth the throat etc while thousands of mothers are cared for at their homes at the birth of their children in at his death another governor of guy hospital mr william hunt left to the hospital he was buried in the vault under the chapel by the side of thomas guy after some years hunt house a large central block with north and south wings of brick with stone facings was erected the whole costing nearly from time to time other needed buildings have been added such as laboratories museums etc there are now in the hospital over seven hundred beds only a few beds are reserved for those who can afford to pay with this exception patients are admitted to all parts of the hospital free of charge the royal guide to london charities compiled by herbert fry says no recommendation is needed for admission to this hospital sickness allied to poverty is an allufficient qualification a fund has been established for relieving the families of deserving and poor patients while they are in the hospital this is not only a blessing to the dependent ones but prevents the anxiety and worry of the suffering inmates guy hospital now receives into its wards yearly over patients and affords medical relief to about the annual income of the hospital is about saving industrious thomas guy wrought even better things for humanity than he could have hoped it paid him to use a newspaper on his counter instead of a tablecloth for his meals if every year thousands of poor men and women could be cared for in sickness without money walk about his pleasant six acres during convalescence and bless forever the name of thomas guy what a contrast such a life to that of one who spends his wealth in fine houses parties expensive yachts and selfndulgence in guy medical school was opened in connection with the hospital and has proved a great success it has become worldamed write messrs wilks and bettany and has received pupils from all englishpeaking lands and not a few foreigners of guy hospital reports which began to be published in they say nothing perhaps has done more to establish the reputation of guy hospital abroad than these reports they may be found in the best libraries in europe and in america and have been well perused by many of the leading men on the continent those who wish to study medicine at guy have to pass a preliminary examination in arts and take a five years course during four years the time is equally divided between the study of the elements of medical science and clinical instruction in the practice of the profession the last year is chiefly devoted to hospital practice with this amount of study it is easily seen why guy medical school takes high rank on march a college built of red brick was formally opened by mr gladstone it cost and is for the resident staff and students a gymnasium was built also in guy hospital has been fortunate in the noted men who have been connected with it one of its early surgeons john belchier lies buried in the same vault with thomas guy he fell in his office and his servant not being able to lift him as he was a heavy man offered to go for assistance no john i am dying he said fetch me a pillow i may as well die here as anywhere else it is related of him that seeing the vanity of all earthly riches he desired to be buried in the hospital with iron nails in his coffin which was to be filled with sawdust the learned dr walter moxon who has been called from his combination of tenderness and ability the perfect physician was associated with guy hospital for twenty years dr wilks says in the garden of dr moxon in the winter lumps of suet and cocoanut sawn in rings were hung upon the arches and boughs for the benefit of the tits and loaves of bread were broken up for the blackbirds thrushes finches and sparrows always before taking his own breakfast on a winter morning moxon first saw to the feeding of his feathered friends dr richard bright whose name is given to the disease which he so carefully studied was for years connected with guy hospital he wrote valuable books and was an untiring student he was sincerely religious both in doctrine and in practice and of so pure a mind that he never was heard to utter a sentiment or to relate an anecdote that was not fit to be heard by the merest child or the most refined woman sir astley paston cooper was associated with guy for twentyive years his father was a clergyman and his mother an author it is said that he was first attracted towards surgery by an accident to one of his fosterrothers the youth fell from a heavy wagon the wheels of which passed over his body tearing the flesh from the thigh and injuring an artery from which the blood flowed freely nobody seemed to know how to stop the blood when astley a boy scarcely more than twelve took out his handkerchief and tied it tightly around the thigh and above the wound thus staying the blood till a surgeon could be brought sir astley used to say this accident which resulted so well created in his mind a love for surgery his uncle william cooper was a surgeon at guy and encouraged his nephew inclination for the medical profession at twentyhree sir astley married a lady of wealth lecturing on surgery on the evening of his weddingay without any of the pupils being aware of his marriage the first year of his practice he received s the second year the third year the fourth year the fifth year the sixth year the seventh the eighth the ninth when he was in the zenith of his fame he received in one year one merchant paid him yearly for a successful operation he was sometimes paid one thousand guineas each year he is said to have given or to poor relations in his busy years writes dr samuel wilks he rose at six dissected privately until eight and from halfast eight saw large numbers of patients gratuitously at breakfast he ate only two welluttered hot rolls drank his tea cool at a draught read his paper a few minutes and then was off to his consultingoom turning round with a sweet benign smile as he left the room at one olock he would scarcely see another patient sometimes the people in the hall and the anteroom were so importunate that mr cooper was driven to escape through his stables and into a passage by bishopsgate church at guy he was awaited by a crowd of pupils on the steps and at once went into the wards addressing the patients with such tenderness of voice and expression that he at once gained their confidence his few pertinent questions and quick diagnosis were of themselves remarkable no less than the judicious calm manner in which he enforced the necessity for operations when required at two olock sir astley cooper went across the street to st thomas hospital to lecture on anatomy after the lecture which was often so crowded that men stood in the gangways and passages near to gain such portion of his lecture as they might fortunately pick up he went round the dissectingoom and afterwards left the hospital to visit patients or to operate privately returning home at halfast six or seven every spare minute in his carriage was occupied with dictating to his assistants notes or remarks on cases or other subjects on which he was engaged at dinner he ate rapidly and not very elegantly talking and joking after dinner he slept for ten minutes at will and then started to his surgical lecture if it were a lecture night in the evening he was usually again on a round of visits till midnight sir astley received a baronetcy and a fee of for successfully removing a small tumor from the head of george he wrote several books and was president of various societies he was as famous abroad as at home the king of the french bestowed upon him the decoration of the legion of honor he died of dropsy in in his chair surrounded by his friends saying as he passed away god bless you adieu to you all and was buried under the chapel near thomas guy his only child died in infancy there is a statue of sir astley in st paul cathedral and a bust of him in the museum of guy he said of himself my own success depended upon my zeal and industry but for this i take no credit as it was given to me from above he is said to have left a fortune of half a million of dollars the beloved frederick denison maurice was elected chaplain of guy hospital in when he was thirtyne he wrote to a friend if i could get any influence over the medical students i should indeed think myself honored and though some who have had experience think such a hope quite a dream i still venture to entertain it there seems no reason why a medical student or any student indeed should be rough in manner or hard of heart a true man will be a gentleman not less in the dissectingoom than in the parlor he will be humane to the lowest animal and tender and considerate in the presence of suffering sir william withey gull the son of a bargewner and wharfinger in essex who rose to eminence by his power of work and will was for twenty years physician and lecturer at guy hospital going there as a student when he was twentyne he was told by the treasurer i can help you if you will help yourself he used to say that his real education was given him by his sweetaced mother he won many prizes acted as tutor to gain the means of living and made friends by his winsome manner as well as his knowledge the lady to whom he was engaged died but her father was so attached to young gull that he left him a considerable legacy mr gull afterwards married a sister of his friend dr lacy he rose rapidly in his profession and was made f r s in having been made of oxford and cambridge the previous year his knowledge was profound on many subjects oetry philosophy and of course medicine his industry was astonishing to all and his personal influence remarkable not many years ago says dr wilks we heard an old student of guy descant on his beautiful lectures and especially those on fever on being questioned as to what gull said which most struck him he said he could not remember anything in particular but he would come to london any day to hear gull reiterate the words in very slow measure ow typhoid gentlemen when gull left the bedside of his patient and said in measured tones ou will get well it was like a message from above it was not penetration only which gull possessed but endurance it was ever being remarked with what deliberate care he went over every case as if that particular one was his sole charge for the day dr gull attended the prince of wales in his very severe illness from typhoid fever in when his life was despaired of and for this he was created a baronet and physician extraordinary to the queen he died of apoplexy jan leaving a fortune of over a million and a half of dollar largely earned by his own industry and ability his son sir cameron gull has founded a studentship of pathology at guy worth about per annum sir william was buried by his own desire in his native village thorpeeoken beside his father and mother thomas guy has slept for over a century in the midst of the great work which his fortune began and still carries forward who shall estimate the good done every year to six thousand suffering persons mostly poor who need the care and skill of a great hospital and to seventy thousand or two hundred daily who come for medical treatment the fact that thomas guy became rich through industry economy and business sagacity will be forgotten the fact that he was a member of parliament for thirteen years is of little moment but the fact that he gave his wealth to bless the world will be remembered as long as england lasts or humanity suffers sophia smith and her college for women miss sophia smith the founder of smith college came from a family of savers as well as givers selfndulgent persons rarely give she was the niece of oliver smith whose unique charities have been a blessing to many towns mr smith who died at hatfield mass dec left to the towns of northampton hadley hatfield amherst and williamsburg in the county of hampshire and deerfield greenfield and whately in the county of franklin about a million dollars to a board of trustees to be used as follows to be set aside for sixty years from the time of his death so as to double and treble itself for an agricultural school at northampton in fortyine years after mr smith died this fund had become so rapidly does interest accumulate this will be used to purchase two farms one a pattern farm to become a model to all farmers the other an experimental farm to aid the pattern farm in the art and science of husbandry and agriculture buildings are to be erected on the grounds suitable for mechanics and workshops for the manufacture of implements of husbandry of the most approved models if the income will warrant it tools for other trades may be manufactured there is also to be a school of industry on the farms for the benefit of the poor the boys to be aided must be from the poorest in the town are to receive a good common education and be taught in agriculture or in some mechanic art in the shops on the premises when twentyne years of age they are to be loaned each and after paying interest for five years at five per cent are to receive the as a gift if they have proved themselves worthy three years before they are twentyne each is to have a portion of his time to earn for himself after a bequest of to the american colonization society mr smith will provided that his property should go to poor boys and girls poor young women and widows the boy not under twelve of good moral character should be bound out to some respectable family and receive at twentyne if he had been a faithful apprentice a loan of and after five years the gift in full to help him make a start in the world the girl so bound out if maintaining a good moral character should receive as a marriage portion if the man she was to marry seemed a worthy man if he was unworthy the girl was to be aided in sickness or mental derangement up to the full amount of the marriage portion illustration sophia smith each young woman in indigent or moderate circumstances if she were to marry a sober man could by applying to the trustees receive a marriage portion of fifty dollars to be expended for necessary articles of household furniture each widow with a child or children dependent on her for support could receive fifty dollars and this might be given yearly if the trustees thought wise mr smith lived and died unmarried but he knew that the pathway of many struggling lovers would be made easier if the young woman had even fifty dollars or if the girl had been bound out with strangers would make many a little home after marriage comfortable mr smith has been dead over half a century but his quaint and beautiful gift has been doing its work during the year boys and girls were placed in good homes and reared for useful lives nine received their marriage portion and sixteen were helped in sickness thirty boys received their loan of each and thirty their gift of a like amount there are now apprenticed boys and girls marriage gifts were made to young women and were paid to each of widows last year persons received gifts to the amount of what happiness this money means to those for the most part just looking out into the cares and work of life how many fortunes are built on that first so difficult to accumulate how many homes kept from dire poverty by that first with which to make the place attractive as well as comfortable what an incentive for a boy or girl to be industrious saving temperate and upright what a comfort to feel that after we are silent our work can speak for us through a whole state and even a whole nation mr oliver smith depended much upon his nephew austin smith a successful and wealthy man to carry out his wishes austin and his brother joseph were members of the general court of massachusetts when their father died though he was not wealthy like oliver he left his two sons the larger part of his fortune and his two daughters harriet and sophia enough to support them with close economy the father was a soldier in the revolutionary war and the grandfather samuel smith was commissioned lieutenant in by governor phipps sophia who must have been a sweetaced girl judging from her appearance in later life was eager for study but there was little chance for a girl to obtain an education and little sympathy as a rule with those girls who desired it she was born in hatfield mass aug when sophia was a little girl abigail adams the noble wife of john adams our second president wrote to a friend in england you need not be told how much in this country female education is neglected nor how fashionable it is to ridicule female learning mrs samuel lock stow in a history of mount holyoke seminary shows how meagre were the early advantages for girls boston did not permit girls to attend the public schools till and then only during the summer months when there were not boys enough to fill them this lasted till when boston became a city an aged resident of hatfield used to tell of going to the schoolhouse when she was a girl and sitting on the doorstep to hear the boys recite their lessons no girl could cross the threshold as a scholar the girls of northampton were not admitted to the public schools till in the centennial hampshire gazette it was stated n the question was before the town and it was voted not to be at any expense for schooling girls the advocates of the measure were persistent however and appealed to the courts the town was indicted and fined for this neglect in it was voted by a large majority to admit girls between the ages of eight and fifteen to the schools from may to oct it was not till that all restrictions were removed these summer schools from may to october were of comparatively little worth all children brought their work braiding sewing and knitting and were taught to read and write and to have good manners according to the accepted notions of the time at first arithmetic and geography were taught only in the winter for a knowledge of numbers or ability to cast accounts was deemed quite superfluous for girls when colburn mental arithmetic was introduced some of our mothers who desired to study it were told derisively f you expect to become widows and have to carry pork to market it may be well enough to study mental arithmetic the first school in new england says mrs stow designed exclusively for the instruction of girls in branches not taught in the common schools is said to have been an evening school conducted by william woodbridge who was a graduate of yale in his theme on graduation was mprovement in female education reducing his theory to practice in addition to his daily occupation he gave his evenings to the instruction of girls in lowth grammar guthrie geography and the art of composition the popular sentiment deemed him visionary ho it said hall cook our food and mend our clothes if the girls are to be taught philosophy and astronomy in waterford n y in occurred the public examination of a young lady in geometry it was the first instance of the kind in the state and perhaps in the country and called forth a storm of ridicule her teacher was mrs emma willard sophia smith girlhood was passed during this indifference or opposition to education for women when she was fourteen in she went to school in hartford conn for twelve weeks and four years later at eighteen she was for a short time a pupil in the hopkins academy in hadley she studied diligently with her quick eager mind and was thankful for these crumbs of knowledge though she lamented through her life that her opportunities had been so limited year by year went by in the quiet new england home her sister harriet taking upon herself the burden of household cares and business as sophia was frail and at forty had become very deaf her mind had been broadened and her heart kept tender to every sorrow by her christian faith and devotion to duty the town of hatfield had capable ministers who were intellectual as well as spiritual helpers and sophia smith enjoyed cultivated minds by reading mostly says the rev john greene of lowell mass she kept herself familiar with the common events and occurrences of the day probably what she and others called a calamity was a blessing to her she had fortitude to bear the trial and the wisdom to improve the reflective and meditative powers of her mind far beyond what the fashionable and gossiping woman attains deafness is an admirable remedy for insincerity shallowness and foolish talking it sifts what we hear and compels us to try to say what is worth attention miss smith attended the services of the congregational church of which she was a member and though she could not hear a word of the sermon perhaps she felt accountable for the influence of her presence she loved the bible and would quote the words of sir william jones the bible contains more true sublimity more exquisite beauty more pure morality more important history and finer strains of poetry and eloquence than can be collected from all other books in whatever age or language they have been written she had the strength of character of the typical new england woman yet possessing gentle manners and most refined tastes she loved nature and in hatfield with its magnificent elms and beautiful river miss smith had much to enjoy some of these great elms measure twentyight feet in circumference three yards from the ground in this charming scenery reading her books and doing good as she had opportunity miss smith was growing old her sister harriet had died a little before the time of our civil war and the lonely woman bent her energies towards helping other aching hearts she worked with her own hands to aid the soldiers and their families and when she had the means used it generously her brother austin died march and very unexpectedly sophia smith became the possessor through his gift of over god permitted him says the rev mr greene to gather the gold preparing all the while the heart of a devout and christlike sister to dispense it miss smith at once felt her great responsibility some persons living all their lives most carefully would have rejoiced at the opportunity to buy comforts carriage for daily riding attractive clothes more books or take a journey to the old world or elsewhere but miss smith said at once this is a large property put into my hands but i am only the steward of god in respect to it she very wisely sought the advice of her pastor the rev john greene a man of broad scholarship and generous nature dr greene was a lover of books and finding so much happiness for himself in a student life he rightly thought that woman should have the bliss of possessing knowledge for her own sake as well as for her increased influence in the world miss smith desired so to give as would accord with the wishes of her brother austin were he alive but could not be sure what were his preferences she wished to give the money for education for that was her great joy mingled with regret that her way as that of every other woman at that time had been so hedged up by mistaken public opinion she longed to build a college for women even when learned doctors wrote books to show that girls would be ruined in health by study and that they were mentally inferior to the other sex it was said that women would not care for higher education that if they went to college they would not marry and would cease to be attractive to men that in any event the intellectual standard would be lowered if women were admitted to any college miss smith said there is no justice in denying women equal educational advantages with men women are the natural educators and physicians of the race and they ought to be fitted for their work when the foolish and untrue argument was used that educated women do not make good wives and mothers miss smith would say then they are wrongly educated ome law is violated in the process miss smith had read history and she knew that the aspasias and the de maintenons are the women who have had the strongest power with men she knew that an educated woman is the companion of her children and their intellectual guide she knew that women ought to be interested in the welfare of the state rather than in a round of parties and amusements she had no love for display though she had taste in dress and in her home and she longed to see all women have a purpose in life other than frivolity and pleasureeeking but miss smith feared that would not be sufficient to found a college for women and gave up the idea two months after her brother died she made her will giving for an academy at hatfield to a deaf mute institution in hatfield and to a scientific school in connection with amherst college six years later mr john clarke provided a deaf mute institution for the commonwealth and miss smith was at liberty to turn her fortune into another channel the old idea of a real college for women a project as dear to dr greene as to herself was again upon her mind she read all she could find upon the subject she loved and believed in her own sex and knew the low intellectual standard of the ordinary boardingchool she said we should educate the whole woman physical intellectual moral and spiritual she insisted that the education given in the college which she hoped to found should be equal to that obtained in a college for men there is a good deal that is heroic says a writer in scribner monthly may in the spectacle of this lonely woman shut out in a great measure by her infirmity and secluded life from so many human interests and pleasures quietly elaborating a plan by which she could broaden and enrich the lives of multitudes of her sex and give increased dignity and power to woman in the generations to come in july miss smith made her last will stating the object for which she wished her money to be used the establishment and maintenance of an institution for the higher education of young women with the design to furnish them means and facilities for education equal to those which are afforded in our colleges for young men the formal wording says a jordan in the new england magazine for january hardly tells the story of selfenial painful industry commonplace restriction and isolation that lies behind it in the lives of this brother and sister miss smith wished the college to be christian not congregational she said or baptist or methodist or episcopalian but christian she hoped the bible would be studied in the hebrew and greek in her college so that the students could know for themselves the truth of the translations which we have toay miss smith gave about for the founding of smith college he fortune left by her brother had increased ith the express condition that not more than half the amount should be used in buildings and grounds it required much urging to allow the college to bear her name after counselling with friends miss smith decided that the college should be built at northampton which george bancroft thought the most beautiful town in new england where no one can live without imbibing love for the place with the provision that the town should raise which was done northampton seemed preferable to hatfield because more easy of access and possessed of a public library and other intellectual attractions after her brother money came into her hands miss smith continued to economize for herself but gave generously to others often in her journal she wrote i feel the responsibility of this great property she subscribed to the massachusetts agricultural college if it should be located at northampton for a library for the young people literary association in hatfield towards the organ in the church for the endowment of a professorship in andover theological seminary and to many other objects she gave to them all says dr greene home missions and foreign missions the bible society and tract society the seamen and freedmen o all the objects presented in her journal she writes desire to give where duty calls before her death she had great satisfaction and comfort in her andover donation when she was considering whether or not to make her donation to andover theological seminary professor park asked her if he might consult a mutual friend an eminent lawyer and business man about it with uplifted hands and almost a rebuking gesture she replied o no il make up my mind myself one of her most intimate friends a graduate of mount holyoke seminary remarked never was acquainted with a person who felt more deeply than miss smith her accountability to god miss smith life declined pleasantly and happily in she wrote in her journal sunday afternoon it is a most splendid day have been to church although i have not heard i feel the presence of him who is everywhere and who is all love to him that seeketh him and serves him i resolve with his blessing to give myself unreservedly anew to him to watch over my thoughts and words and to strive after a more perfect life in all my dealings with my fellowen and strive to make this great affliction deafnes a means of sanctification and make it a means of improvement in the divine life may she made her last record in her journal i resolve to begin anew to strive to be better in everything to guard against carelessness in talking to strive for more patience and sense and to strive for more earnestness to do more good to strive against selfishness and to cultivate good feelings in all to live to god glory that others seeing our good works may glorify our father in heaven such golden words might well be cut on the walls of smith college that the students might imitate the resolve of the founder who believed as she said in her will that all education should be for the glory of god and the good of man it is not my design to render my sex any the less feminine but to develop as fully as may be the powers of womanhood and furnish women with the means of usefulness happiness and honor now withheld from them one month after writing in her journal june sophia smith passed to her reward at the age of seventyive she was in her usual health till four days before her death when she was prostrated by paralysis she was buried in the hatfield cemetery under a simple monument of her own erecting she had provided for a better and more enduring monument in smith college and she knew that no other was needed the seventyivehousandollar academy at hatfield would also keep her in blessed remembrance the thought of miss smith after her death began to shape itself into brick and stone thirteen acres of ground were purchased for the site of the college commanding a view of the beautiful valley of the connecticut river and the main building of brick and freestone was erected in secular gothic style the interior finished in unpainted native woods on the large stainedlass window over the entrance of the building is a copy of the college seal a woman radiant with light with the motto underneath in greek which expressed the desire of the founder add to your virtue knowledge the homestead which was on the estate when purchased was made over for a home for the students as the plan of small dwellings to accommodate from twenty to fifty young women had been decided upon in preference to several hundreds gathered under one roof the right person for the right place had been chosen as president the rev dr clark seelye at that time a professor in amherst college he had made a careful inspection of the principal educational institutions both in this country and in europe and his plans as to buildings and courses of study were adopted smith college was dedicated july and opened to students in the following september president seelye in his admirable inaugural address said one hundred years ago a female college would have been simply an object of ridicule you have seen machines invented to do the work which formerly absorbed the greater portion of woman time and strength factories have supplanted the spinningheel and distaff sewingachines will stitch in an hour more than our grandmothers could in a day i need not ask you what we are to do with force which has thus been set free the answer comes clearly from an enlightened public opinion saying ut it to higher uses train it to think correctly to work intelligently to do its share in bringing the human mind to the perfection for which it was designed dr seelye emphasized the fact that this college was to give women an education as high and thorough and complete as that which young men receive in harvard yale and amherst i believe he said this is the only female college that insists upon substantially the same requisites for admission which have been found practicable and essential in male colleges he disapproved of a preparatory department and other colleges for women have wisely followed the standard and example of smith secondary schools have seen the necessity of a higher fitting for their students that they may enter our best colleges greek and the higher mathematics were made an essential part of the course to this exception was taken and dr seelye was frequently asked what use have young women of greek he answered a study of greek brings us into communion with the best scholarship and the acutest intellects of all european countries it would simply justify its place in our college curriculum upon the relation which it has had and ever must have to the growth of the human intellect dr seelye favored the teaching of music and art but not to the exclusion of other things unless one had special gifts along those lines musical entertainments he said have generally been the grand paraderound of female boardingchools all of us are familiar with the many wearisome hours which young ladies ordinarily are required to spend at the piano ime enough to master most of the sciences and languages and all of us are familiar with the remark heard so frequently after schoolays are over cannot play i am out of practice president seelye had to meet all sorts of objections to higher education for women when he told a friend that greek was to be studied in smith college the friend replied nonsense girls cannot bear such a strain and yet his own daughters says dr seelye were going with no remonstrance from him night after night through the round of parties and fashionable amusements in a great city we question whether any greater expenditure of physical force is necessary to master greek than to endure ordinary fashionable amusements woman health is endangered far more by balls and parties than by schools for one ruined by overtudy we can point to a hundred ruined by dainties and dances another said to president seelye think of a wife who forced you to talk perpetually about metaphysics or to listen to greek and latin quotations this would be much more agreeable conversation to some men than to hear about dress and servants and gossip when smith college was opened in there were many applicants but with requirements for admission the same as at harvard yale brown and amherst only fifteen could pass the examinations the next year eighteen were accepted each year the number has increased till in the year there were students at smith college the professorships are about equally divided between men and women the chair of greek on the john greene foundation is founded in honor of the rev john greene who first suggested to miss smith the idea of the college and was her confidential adviser in her bequest says the college calendar there are three courses of study each extending through four years he classical course leading to the degree of bachelor of arts the scientific to bachelor of science the literary to bachelor of letters the maximum of work allowed to any student in a regular course is sixteen hours of recitation each week year by year miss smith noble gift has been supplemented by the gifts of others in the lilly hall of science was dedicated the gift of mr alfred theodore lilly this building contains lecture rooms and laboratories for chemistry physics geology zo logy and botany in mr winthrop hillyer gave the money to erect the hillyer art gallery which now contains an extensive collection of casts engravings and paintings and is provided with studios one corridor of engravings and an alcove of original drawings were given by the century company mr hillyer gave an endowment of for his gallery a musicall was also erected in the observatory given by two donors unknown to the public has an elevennch refracting telescope a spectroscope siderial clock chronograph a portable telescope and a meridian circle aperture four inches the alumn gymnasium contains a swimmingath and a large hall for gymnastic exercises and inoor sport a large greenhouse has been erected to aid in botanical work with an extensive collection of tropical plants there are eight or more dwellingouses for the students each presided over by a competent woman where the scholars find cheerful happy homes the tenney house bequeathed by mrs mary a tenney for experiments in coperative housekeeping enables the students to adapt their expenses to their means if they choose to make the experiment together tuition is a year with for board and furnished room in the college houses smith college is fortunately situated opposite the grounds is the beautiful forbes library with an endowment of for books alone and not far away a public library with several thousand volumes and a permanent endowment of for its increase the students have access to the collections at amherst college and the massachusetts agricultural college also at mount holyoke college about seven miles distant there are no secret societies at smith instead of hazing newcomers says president seelye the second or sophomore class will give them a reception in the artallery introduce them to the older students with the courteous hospitality which good breeding dictates there are several literary and charitable societies in smith college great interest is taken in the workingirls of new york and in the college settlement of that city none of the evil effects predicted for young women in college have been realized some of our best scholars says president seelye have steadily improved in health since entering college some who came so feeble that it was doubtful whether they could remain a term have become entirely well and strong we have had frequently professors from male institutions to give instruction and their testimony is to the effect that the girls study better than the boys and that the average scholarship is higher the general atmosphere of the college is one of freedom writes louise walston in the history of higher education in massachusetts by george gary bush ph the written code consists of one law ights out at ten the unwritten is that of every wellegulated community and to the success of this method of discipline every year is a witness this freedom is not license the system of attendance upon recitation at smith is in this respect unique it is distinctively a out system in the college market that commodity known as indulgences is not to be found and no student is expected to absent herself from lecture or recitation except for good reasons the validity of which however is left to her own conscience knowledge is offered as a privilege and is so received as miss smith directed in her will the holy scriptures are daily and systematically read and studied in the college a chapel service is held in the morning of weekays and a vesper service on sunday students attend the churches of their preference in northampton all honor to sophia smith the quiet christian woman who forgetting herself became a blessing to tens of thousands by her gifts at the request of the trustees of smith college dr greene is preparing a volume on her life and character all honor too to the rev john greene who for twentyive years has been the beloved pastor of the eliot church in lowell mass his quarter century of service was fittingly celebrated at lowell sept out of five hundred congregational ministers in massachusetts only ten have held so long a pastorate as he over one church among the hundreds of congratulations and testimonies to dr greene successful ministry the able professor edwards a park of andover wrote to the congregation the city of lowell has been favored with clergymen who will be remembered by a distant posterity but not one of them will be remembered longer than the present pastor of eliot church he was the father of smith college now so flourishing in northampton mass had it not been for him that great institution would never have existed for this great benefaction to the world he will be honored a hundred years hence james lick and his telescope james lick one of the great givers of the west was born in fredericksburg penn aug little is known of his early life except that his ancestors were germans and that he was born in poverty his grandfather served in the revolutionary war james learned to make organs and pianos in hanover penn and in worked for joseph hiskey a prominent piano manufacturer of baltimore one day conrad meyer a poor lad came into the store and asked for work young lick gave him food and clothing and secured a place for him in the establishment they became fast friends and continued thus for life later conrad meyer was a wealthy manufacturer of pianos in philadelphia james lick in when he was twentyour went to new york hoping to begin business for himself but finding his capital too limited in the following year went to buenos ayres south america where he lived for ten years at the end of that time he went to philadelphia and met his old friend conrad meyer he had brought with him for sale worth of hides and nutria skins the latter are obtained from a species of otter found along the la plata river he intended settling in philadelphia and rented a house on eighth street near arch but soon abandoned his purpose probably because the business outlook was not hopeful and returned to buenos ayres to sell pianos from the east side of south america he went to the west side and remained in valparaiso chili for four years he spent eleven years in peru making and selling pianos once when his workmen left him suddenly to go to mexico rather than break a contract he did all the work himself and accomplished it in two years in he went to san francisco which had only one thousand inhabitants he was then about fifty years old and took with him over which foreseeing california wonderful prospects he invested in land in san francisco and farther south in santa clara valley illustration james lick used by courtesy of the overland monthly in to the surprise of everybody the quiet parsimonious james lick built a magnificent flourill six miles from san jos he tore down an old structure and erected in its place a mill finished within in solid mahogany highly polished and furnished it with the best machinery possible it was called the mahogany mill or more frequently lick folly he made the grounds about the mill very attractive upon it says the san jos daily mercury june he began early to set out trees of various kinds both for fruit and ornament he held some curious theories of treelanting and believed in the efficiency of a bone deposit about the roots of every young tree many are the stories told by old residents of james lick going along the highway in an old rattletrap ropeied wagon with a bearskin robe for a seat cushion and stopping every now and then to gather in the bones of some dead beast people used to think him crazy until they saw him among his beloved trees planting some new and rare variety and carefully mingling about its young roots the finest of loams with the bones he had gathered during his lonely rides there is a story extant and probably wellounded which illustrates the odd means he employed to secure hired help at once trustworthy and obedient one day while he was planting his orchard a man applied to him for work mr lick directed him to take the trees he indicated to a certain part of the grounds and then to plant them with the tops in the earth and the roots in the air the man obeyed the directions to the letter and reported in the evening for further orders mr lick went out viewed his work with apparent satisfaction and then ordered him to plant the trees the proper way and thereafter to continue in his employ nineteen years after mr lick built his mill jan he surprised the people of san jos again by giving it to the paine memorial society of boston half the proceeds of sale to be used for a memorial hall and half to sustain a lecture course he had always been an admirer of thomas paine writings the mill was annually inundated by the floods from the guadalupe river spoiling his orchards and his roads so that he tired of the property an agent of the boston society went to california sold the mill for cash and carried the money back to boston mr lick was displeased that the property which had cost him should be sold at such a low price and without his knowledge as he would willingly have bought it in at it is said by some that mr lick built his mill as a protest against the cheap and flimsy style of building on the pacific coast but it is much more probable that he built it for another reason in early life it is believed that young lick fell in love with the daughter of a welloo miller for whom he worked when the young man made known his love which was reciprocated by the girl the miller was angry and is said to have replied out you beggar dare you cast your eyes upon my daughter who will inherit my riches have you a mill like this have you a single penny in your purse to this lick replied that he had nothing as yet but one day he would have a mill beside which this one would be a pigsty lick caused his elegant mill to be photographed without and within and sent the pictures to the miller it was however too late to win the girl if indeed he ever hoped to do so for she had long since married and mr lick went through life a lonely and unresponsive man he never lived in his palatial mill but occupied for a time a humble abode near by after mr lick disposed of his mill he began to improve a tract of land south of san jos known as the lick homestead addition day after day says the san jos mercury long trains of carts and wagons passed slowly through san jos carrying tall trees and fullrown shrubbery from the old to the new location winter and summer alike the work went on the old man superintending it all in his rattletrap wagon and bearskin robe his plans for this new improvement were made regardless of expense tradition tells that he had imported from australia rare trees and in order to secure their growth had brought with them whole shiploads of their native earth he conceived the idea of building conservatories superior to any on the pacific coast and for that purpose had imported from england the materials for two large conservatories after the model of those in the kew gardens in london his death occurred before he could have these constructed and they remained on the hands of the trustees until a body of san francisco gentlemen contributed funds for their purchase and donation to the use of the public in golden gate park where they now stand as the wonder and delight of all who visit that beautiful resort mr lick also built in san francisco a handsome hotel called the lick house with his own hands he carved some of the rosewood frames of the mirrors he caused the walls to be decorated with pictures of california scenery the diningoom has a polished floor made of many thousand pieces of wood of various kinds when mr lick was seventyeven years old and found himself the owner of millions with a laudable desire to be remembered after death and a patriotism worthy of high commendation he began to think deeply how best to use his property on feb mr lick offered to the california academy of sciences a piece of land on market street the site of its present building professor george davidson then president of the academy called to thank him when mr lick unfolded to him his purpose of giving a great telescope for future investigation of the heavenly bodies he had become deeply interested from reading it is said about possible life on other planets it is supposed by some that while mr lick lived his lonely life in peru a priest who gained his friendship interested him in astronomy others think his mind was drawn towards it by reading about the washington observatory completed in and noticed widely by the press mr lick was not a scientist nor an astronomer he had been too absorbed in successful business life for that but he earned money that others might have the time and opportunity to devote their lives to science mr lick appears to have had a passion for statuary as shown by his gifts at one time he thought of having expensive memorial statues of himself and family erected on the heights overlooking the ocean and the bay but was dissuaded by one of his pioneer friends according to miss w shinn account in the overland monthly november mr j staples felt it his duty to tell mr lick frankly that his bequests for statues of himself and family would be utterly useless as a memorial that the world would not be interested in them and when mr lick urged that such costly statues would be preserved for all time as the statues of antiquity now remained the precious relics of a lost civilization answered almost at random ore likely we shall get into a war with russia or somebody and they will come around here with warships and smash the statues to pieces in bombarding the city mr lick conferred with his friends but had his own decided wishes and plans which usually he carried out on july he conveyed all his property real and personal over by deed of trust to seven men but becoming dissatisfied with some members of the board of lick trustees he made a new deed sept under which his property has been used as he directed a year later he changed some of the members but the deed itself remained as before one of the first bequests under his deed of trust was for the telescope and observatory another to the protestant orphan asylum of san francisco for an orphan asylum in san jos free to all orphans without regard to creed or religion of parents to the ladies protective and belief society of san francisco to the mechanics institute of san francisco to be applied to the purchase of scientific and mechanical works for such institute to the trustees of the society for prevention of cruelty to animals of san francisco with the hope expressed by him that the trustees of said society may organize such a system as will result in establishing similar societies in every city and town in california to the end that the rising generations may not witness or be impressed with such scenes of cruelty and brutality as constantly occur in this state to found in san francisco an institution to be called the old ladies home for the erection and the maintenance of that extremely useful public charity free public baths these baths went into use nov for the erection of a monument to be placed in golden gate park to the memory of francis scott key the author of he starpangled banner this statue was unveiled july to endow an institution to be called the california school of mechanical arts to be open to all youths born in california for statuary emblematical of three important epochs in the history of california to be placed in front of the san francisco city hall to john h lick his son born in pennsylvania june the latter contested the will and a compromise was effected whereby he received the expense of the suit being a little over this son at his death founded lick college fredericksburg penn giving it practically all his fortune it is now called schuylkill seminary and had pupils in according to the report of the commissioner of education a family monument was erected at fredericksburg penn mr lick birthplace at a cost of mr lick set aside some personal property for his own economical use during his life after all these bequests had been attended to the remainder of his fortune was to be given in equal proportions to the california academy of sciences and the society of california pioneers to be expended in erecting buildings for them and in the purchase of a suitable library natural specimens chemical and philosophical apparatus rare and curious things useful in the advancement of science and generally in the carrying out of the objects and purposes for which said societies were respectively established each society has received about from the lick estate these were very remarkable gifts from a man who had been a mechanic brought up in narrow circumstances and with limited education the california school of mechanical arts was opened in january and now in the spring of has pupils the substantial brick buildings are in spanish architecture and cost with machinery and furniture about leaving for endowment the academic building is three stories high and the shops one and two stories the requirements for pupils in entering the school are substantially the same as for the last of the grammar grades of the public schools there is no charge for tuition mr lick in making this bequest stated its object to educate males and females in the practical arts of life such as working in wood iron and stone or any of the metals and in whatever industry intelligent mechanical skill now is or can hereafter be applied in view of this desire on the part of the giver a careful survey of industrial education was made and it was decided to give each student a thorough knowledge of the technique of some one industrial pursuit from which he may earn a living the school course is four years at the beginning of the third year the student must choose his field of work for the last year and a half and give his time to it besides the ordinary branches carpentry forging moulding machine and architectural drawing woodarving dressmaking millinery cookery etc are taught it is expected that graduates will be able to earn good wages at once after leaving the school and the teachers endeavor to find suitable situations for their pupils miss caroline willard baldwin at the head of the science department who is herself a bachelor of science from the university of california and a doctor of science from cornell university writes me the grade of work is much the same as that given in the pratt institute in brooklyn and the entire equipment of the school is excellent the lick bronze statuary at the city hall in san francisco was unveiled on thanksgiving day thursday nov mr lick had specified in his deed of trust that it should represent by appropriate designs and figures the history of california first from the early settlement of the missions to the acquisition of california by the united states second from such acquisition by the united states to the time when agriculture became the leading interest of the state third from the lastamed period to the first day of january he knew that there is no more effective way to teach history and inculcate love of city and nation than by objectessons a great gift is a continual suggestion to others to give also the statue of a noble man or woman is a constant educator and inspirer to good deeds the lick statuary is of granite surmounted by bronze figures of heroic proportions the main column is fortyix feet high with a bronze figure twelve feet high weighing pounds on the top representing eureka a woman typical of california with a grizzly bear by her side beneath are four panels depicting a family of immigrants crossing the sierras a vaquero lassoing a steer traders with the indians and california under american rule below these panels are the heads in bronze of james lick father junipero serra sir francis drake and john fr mont and below these the names of men famous in the history of california ames w marshall the discoverer of gold at sutter mill and others there are granite wings to the main pedestal the bronze figures of which represent early times native indian over whom bends a catholic priest and a spaniard throwing his lasso a group of miners in and figures denoting commerce and agriculture the artist was mr frank happersberger a native of california members of the california pioneers made eloquent addresses at the unveiling of the beautiful statue the band played the starpangled banner and the children of the public schools sang america the benefactions of james lick were not of a posthumous character said the hon willard b farwell in his address there was no indication of a desire to accumulate for the sake of accumulation alone and to cling with greedy purpose and tenacity to the last dollar gained until the heart had ceased its pulsations and the last breath had been drawn before yielding it up for the good of others on the contrary he provided for the distribution of his wealth while living there was no room for cavil then over the manner of his giving he fulfilled in its broadest measure the injunction of the aphorism e gives well who gives quickly the gift nearest to mr lick heart was his great telescope to be as he said in his deed of trust superior to and more powerful than any telescope yet made with all the machinery appertaining thereto and appropriately connected therewith this telescope with its building was to be conveyed to the university of california and to be known as the lick astronomical department of the university of california various sites were suggested for the great telescope a gentleman relates the following story one of the sites suggested was a mountain north of san francisco mr lick was ill but determined upon visiting this mountain so he was taken on a cot to the station and on arriving at the town nearest the mountain the cot was removed to a wagon and they started towards the summit by some accident the rear of the wagon gave way and the cot containing the old gentleman slid out on the mountainide this so angered him that he said he would never place the telescope on a mountain that treated him in that way and ordered the party to turn back towards san francisco during the summer of mr lick sent mr fraser his trusted agent to report on mount st helena monte diablo mount hamilton and others in many respects the latter in sight of his old mill at san jos seemed the best situated of all the mountain peaks yet the possibility that a complete astronomical establishment might one day be planted on its summit seemed more like a fairyale than like sober fact says professor edward s holden director of the lick observatory it was at that time a wilderness a few cattleanches occupied the valleys around it its slopes were covered with chaparral or thickets of scrub oak not even a trail led over it the nearest house was eleven miles away it was and is the home of many rattlesnakes they live upon squirrels and small birds and their eggs and come up to the top of the mountain in quest of water sir edwin arnold who visited mount hamilton tells this incident of the roadunner the bird sometimes called chaparral cock as it was told to him the rattlesnake is the deadly enemy of its species always hunting about in the thickets for eggs and young birds since the oadunner builds its nest on the ground when therefore the haparral cocks find a attler basking in the sun they gather i was assured leaves of the prickly cactus and lay them in a circle all around the serpent which cannot draw its belly over the sharp needles of these leaves thus imprisoned the reptile is set upon by the birds and pecked or spurred to death mount hamilton fifty miles southeast of san francisco is near san jos twentyix miles eastward and thus easy of access save the difficulty of reaching its summit feet above the sea this was overcome by the willingness of santa clara county to construct a road to its top which road was completed in december at a cost of about the road rises feet in twentywo miles and the grade nowhere exceeds six and onealf feet in one hundred or feet to the mile towards the top it winds round and round the flanks of the mountain itself the view from the top of the mountain is most inspiring the lovely valley of santa clara and the santa cruz mountains to the west a bit of the pacific and the bay of monterey to the southwest the sierra nevada fee with countless ranges between to the southeast the san joaquin valley with the sierras beyond to the east while to the north lie many lower ranges of hills and on the horizon mount shasta or lassens butte fee miles away the bay of san francisco lies flat before you and beyond it is mount tamalpais at the entrance to the golden gate one of the gorges in the vicinity of mount hamilton writes taliesin evans in the may century is reputed to have been a favorite retreat of joaquin murietta the famous bandit whose name was a terror to the early settlers of the state a spring situated a mile and a half east of observatory peak at which he is said to have drawn water now bears the name of oaquin spring on june congress gave the land for the site acres and other land was given and purchased till the observatory now has acres it was necessary to remove tons of solid rock from the mountain summit which was lowered as much as thirtywo feet in places that the buildings might have a level foundation clay for making the brick was found about two and onealf miles below the observatory by the roa thus saving over in the bricks used springs also were fortunately discovered about feet below the present level of the summit in after the site had been decided upon professor s w burnham of chicago was asked by the lick trustees to test it for astronomical purposes he took his telescope and remained there during august september and october out of sixty nights he found fortywo were of the very highest class for making observations while eleven were foggy or cloudy he discovered fortywo new double stars while on the top of the mountain professor burnham said in his report the remarkable steadiness of the air and the continued succession of nights of almost perfect definition are conditions not to be hoped for in any place with which i am acquainted and judging from the previous reports of the various observatories are not to be met with elsewhere meantime even before congress gave the land in mr o mills one of the first trustees had visited professor holden and professor newcomb at washington to determine about the general plans for the observatory it was agreed that the latter should go to europe to investigate the matter of procuring the glass necessary for a large reflector or refractor it was finally decided that a refracting telescope was the best for the study of double stars and nebul the moon surface etc giving more distinctness and brilliancy and being less subject to atmospheric disturbance professor newcomb experienced much difficulty in europe in finding a firm ready to undertake to make a glass for a telescope larger and more powerful than any yet made the firm of feil sons paris was finally chosen professor newcomb wrote an interesting report of the process of making the glass the materials he said are mixed and melted in a clay pot holding from five hundred pounds to a ton and are constantly stirred with an iron rod until the proper combination is obtained the heat is then slowly diminished until the glass becomes too stiff to be stirred longer then the mass pot and all is placed in the annealing furnace here it must remain undisturbed for a period of a month or more when it is taken out the pot and the outside parts of the glass are broken away to find whether a lump suitable for the required disk can be found in the interior if the interior were perfectly solid and homogeneous there would be no further difficulty the lump would be softened by heat pressed into a flat disk and reannealed when the work would be complete but in practice the interior is always found to be crossed in every direction by veins of unequal density which will injure the performance of the glass and the great mechanical difficulty in the production of the disk is to cut these veins out and still leave a mass which can be pressed into a disk without any folding of the original surface the glass for a telescope is usually composed of a double convex lens of crown glass and a planooncave lens of flint glass feil sons made and shipped the latter which weighed three hundred and seventyive pounds but broke the crown glass in packing it then during three years they made twenty unsuccessful trials before obtaining a perfect glass the cutting away of the clay pot and outside glass is a tedious process requiring weeks and even months no ordinary tools can be used the pieces are sawed by a wire working in sand and water when it is done says professor newcomb the mass must be pressed into the shape of a disk like a very thin grindstone and in order to do this the lump must first be heated to the meltingoint so as to become plastic but when feil began to heat this large mass it flew to pieces he took more and more time for heating and finally succeeded the noted firm of alvan clark sons of cambridge mass did the polishing and shaping of the lenses a labor requiring great skill and delicacy of workmanship the objective glass was ordered in and reached mount hamilton late in having cost it weighs with its cell pounds the clarks would not undertake any larger objective than thirtyix inches this was six inches larger than the great glass which they had made for the imperial observatory at pulkowa near st petersburg in russia the glass though an important part of the telescope was only one of many things to be obtained in captain richard s floyd president of the lick trustees himself a graduate of the united states naval academy met professor holden in london and the latter became the planner and adviser throughout the construction of the buildings and the telescope captain floyd visited many observatories and carried on a vast correspondence amounting to several thousand letters with astronomers and opticians all over the world professor holden was a graduate of west point had been a professor of mathematics in the navy one of the astronomers at the washington observatory in charge of several eclipse expeditions sent out by the government for observation a member of various scientific societies in europe as well as america and associate member of the royal astronomical society of england and wellitted for the position he was afterwards called to fill he directorship of the lick observatory for some time he was also president of the university of california between the years and the large astronomical buildings were erected on the top of mount hamilton the main building of red brick consists of two domes one twentyive feet and six inches in diameter the other seventyix feet in diameter connected by a hall over one hundred and ninetyne feet long this hall is paved and wainscoted with marble the rooms for work and study open towards the east into this hall the library a handsome room with white polished ash cases and tables also opens into it near the main entrance is the visitors room where the visitors register their names among them many noted scientists from various parts of the world j h fickel in the chautauquan june says in this room stands the workbench which mr lick used in his trade that of pianoaking while in peru though not an elaborate affair nothing attracts the attention of visitors more than this article of furniture the large rotating dome at the south end of the building made by the union iron works of san francisco is covered with sheet steel and the movable parts weigh about eightyine tons it is easily handled by means of a small engine in the basement the small dome weighs about eight tons near the main building are the meridian circle house with its instrument for measuring the declination of stars the transit house the astronomers dwellings the shops etc illustration the lick observatory used by courtesy of the overland monthly in the smaller dome is a twelvench equatorial telescope made by alvan clark sons mounted at the lick observatory in october there are also at mount hamilton a sixndnealfnch equatorial telescope a sixndnealfnch meridian circle a fournch transit and zenith telescope a fournch cometeeker a fivench horizontal photoheliograph the crocker photographic telescope and numerous clocks spectroscopes chronographs meteorological instruments and seismometers for measuring the time and intensity of earthquake shocks the buildings and instruments at mount hamilton are imbedded in the solid rock so as not to be affected by the high winds on the top of the mountain in the century for march professor holden gives an interesting account of earthquakes and the instruments for measuring them at the lick observatory in the charleston earthquake of it is computed that square miles trembled besides a vast ocean area the effects of the shock were noted from florida to vermont and from the carolinas to ontario iowa and arkansas the science of the measurement of earthquakes had its birth in tokio japan in which country there are on an average two earthquake shocks daily every part of the upper crust of the earth is in a state of constant change says professor holden these changes were first discovered by their effects on the position of astronomical instruments the earthquake of iquique a seaport town of south america in was shown at the imperial observatory near st petersburg an hour and fourteen minutes later by its effects on the delicate levels of an astronomical instrument i myself have watched the changes in a hill feet above a frozen lake which was feet distan as the ice bent and buckled and changed the pressure on the adjacent shore the level would faithfully indicate every movement in italy and in japan microphones deeply buried in the earth make the earth tremors audible in the observatory telephones during the years there were shocks recorded in san francisco the severest earthquake felt within the city of san francisco was that of this shock threw down chimneys broke glass along miles of streets and put a whole population in terror the lick observatory has a complete set of professor ewing instruments for earthquake measurements accurate time signals are sent from the observatory every day at noon and are received at every railway station between san francisco and ogden and many other cities the instrumental equipment of the observatory is declared to be unrivalled interest centres most of all in the great telescope under the rotating dome for which the nch objective was made with so much difficulty the great steel tube a little over feet long holding the lens and weighing with all its attachments four and onealf tons the iron pier feet high the elaborate yet delicate machinery were all made by warner swasey of cleveland ohio whose skill has brought them welleserved fame the entire weight of the instrument is tons its magnifying power ranges from to diameters on june the observatory with its instruments was transferred by the lick trustees to the university of california the whole cost was leaving for endowment out of the given by mr lick fourteen years had passed since mr lick made his deed of trust he lived long enough to see the site chosen and the plans made for the telescope but died at the lick house oct aged eighty the body lay in state in pioneer hall and on oct was buried in lone mountain cemetery having been followed to the grave by a long procession of state and city officials faculty and students of the university and members of the various societies to which mr lick had given so generously he had expressed a desire to be buried on mount hamilton either within or near the observatory therefore a tomb was made in the base of the pier of the great nch telescope such a tomb says professor holden as no old world emperor could have commanded or imagined on sunday jan the body of james lick having been removed from the cemetery the casket was enclosed in a leadined white maple coffin and laid in the new tomb with appropriate ceremonies witnessed by a large gathering of people a memorial document stating that this refracting telescope is the largest which has ever been constructed and the astronomers who have used it declare that its performance surpasses that of all other telescopes was engrossed on parchment in india ink and signed by the officials it was then placed between two finely tanned skins backed by black silk and soldered in a leaden box eighteen inches in length the same in width and one inch in thickness this was placed upon the iron coffin and the outer casket was soldered up airight after the vault had been built up to the level of the foundation stone a great stone weighing two and onealf tons was let down slowly upon the brickork beneath which was the casket three other stones were placed in position and then one section was laid of the iron pier which weighs tons sir edwin arnold who in went to see the great telescope and by a personal pilgrimage to do homage to the memory of james lick writes with my hand upon the colossal tube slightly managing it as if it were an operalass and my gaze wandering around the splendidly equipped interior full of all needful astronomical resources and built to stand a thousand storms i think with admiration of its dead founder and ask to see his tomb it is placed immediately beneath the big telescope which ascends and descends directly over the sarcophagus wherein repose the mortal relics of this remarkable man marble chest bearing the inscription ere lies the body of james lick truly james lick sleeps gloriously under the bases of his big glass four thousand feet nearer heaven than any of his dead fellowitizens he is buried more grandly than any king or queen and has a finer monument than the pyramids furnished to cheops and cephrenes mr lick wished both to help the world and to be remembered and his wish has been gratified from to the lick telescope with its nch objectlass was the largest refracting telescope in the world the yerkes telescope with its nch objectlass is now the largest in the world it is on the shore of lake geneva wis seventyive miles from chicago and belongs to the chicago university it will be remembered by those who visited the world fair at chicago and saw it in the manufactures and liberal arts building professor george e hale is the director of this great observatory the glass was furnished by mantois of paris from which the lenses were made by alvan g clark the sole survivor of the famous firm of alvan clark sons the crownlass double convex lens weighs pounds the planooncave lens of flint glass nearest the eye end of the telescope weighs over pounds the telescope and dome were made by warner swasey who made also the nch telescope at washington the nch at the university of pennsylvania the nch at the university of minnesota the nch at columbus ohio and others of this firm professor a young in the north american review for february says it is not too much to say that in design and workmanship their instruments do not suffer in comparison with the best foreign make while in andiness they are distinctly superior there is no longer any necessity for us to go abroad for astronomical instruments which are fully up to the highest standards the steel tube of the yerkes telescope is feet long and the rotating dome also of steel weighs nearly tons the observatory of gray roman brick with gray terraotta and stone trimmings is in the form of a roman cross with three domes the largest dome at the western end covering the great telescope of the two smaller domes one will contain a nch telescope and the other a nch professor young says of the yerkes telescope it gathers three times as much light as the nch instrument at princeton two and threeighths as much as the nch telescopes of washington and charlottesville one and fourifths as much as the nch at pulkowa and per cent more than the gigantic and hitherto unrivalled nch telescope of the lick observatory possibly in this one quality of ight the sixoot reflector of lord rosse and the later fiveoot reflector of mr common might compete with or even surpass it but as an instrument for seeing things it is doubtful whether either of them could hold its own with even the smallest of the instruments named above because of the reflector inherent inferiority in distinctness of definition professor young thinks the yerkes telescope can hardly hope for the exceptional excellence of the seeing at mount hamilton nice or ariquipa at least at night the magnifying power of the yerkes telescope is so great being from to that the moon can be brought optically within sixty miles of the observer eye any lunar object five or six hundred feet square would be distinctly visible building for instance as large as the capitol at washington since the death of mr lick others have added to his generous gifts for the purchase of special instruments for sending expeditions to foreign countries to observe total solar eclipses and the like mrs phoebe hearst has given the fund which will yield or more each year for hearst fellowships in astronomy or other special work colonel f crocker has given a photographic telescope and dome and provided a sum sufficient to pay the expenses of an eclipse expedition to be sent from mount hamilton to japan in august under charge of professor sch berle mr edward crossley a wealthy member of parliament for halifax england has given a reflector and fortyoot dome which reached mount hamilton from liverpool in the latter part of mr lick gift of the telescope has stimulated a love for astronomical study and research not only in california but throughout the world the astronomical society of the pacific was founded feb and any man or woman with genuine interest in the science was invited to join it has a membership of over five hundred and its publications are valuable the society holds its summer meetings on mount hamilton very wisely for the sake of diffusing knowledge visitors are made welcome to mount hamilton every saturday evening between the hours of seven and ten olock to look through the big telescope and through the smaller ones when not in use in five years from june to june there were visitors each person is shown the most interesting celestial objects and the whole force of the observatory is on duty and spares no pains to make the visits both interesting and profitable james lick planned wisely when he thought of his great telescope even if he had no other wish than to be remembered and honored undoubtedly he did have other motives for professor holden says a very extensive course of reading had given him the generous idea that the future welleing of the race was the object for a good man to strive to forward towards the end of his life at least the utter futility of his money to give any inner satisfaction oppressed him more and more the results of scientific work of the lick observatory have been most interesting and remarkable professor edward e barnard discovered sept the fifth satellite of jupiter one hundred miles in diameter he discovered nineteen comets in ten years and has been called the cometeeker he has also says professor holden made a very large number of observations upon the physical appearance of the planets venus jupiter and saturn upon the zodiacal light etc upon meteors lunar eclipses double stars occultations of stars etc and he has discovered a considerable number of new nebul also professor barnard resigned oct to accept the position of professor of astronomy in the university of chicago and is succeeded by professor wm j hussey of the leland stanford junior university sir edwin arnold during his visit to the observatory at the suggestion of professor campbell looked through the great telescope upon the nebula in orion i saw he writes in the wellnown region of eta orionis the vast separate system of that universe clearly outlined fleecy irregular mysterious windy shape its edges whirled and curled like those of a stormloud with stars and star clusters standing forth against the milky white background of the nebula like diamonds lying upon silver cloth the central star which to the naked eye or to a telescope of lower power looks single and of no great brilliancy resolved itself under the potent command of the lick glass into a splendid trapezium of four glittering worlds arranged very much like those of the southern cross at the lower rightand border of the beautiful cosmic mist there opens a black abyss of darkness which has the appearance of an inky cloud about to swallow up the silvery filigree of the nebula but this the great glass fills up with unsuspecting worlds when the photographic apparatus is fitted to it i understood professor holden views to be that we were beholding in that almost immeasurably remote silvery haze an entirely separated system of worlds and clusters apart from all others as our own system is but inconceivably grander larger and more populous with suns and planets and their starry allies professor john sch berle formerly of michigan university has discovered two or more comets written much on solar eclipses the canals of mars and the sun corona he with professor s w burnham went to south america to observe the solar eclipse of dec and the former took observations on the solar eclipse april at mina bronces chili professor burnham catalogued over one hundred and ninetyight new double stars which he discovered while at mount hamilton he with professor holden and others have taken remarkable photographs of the moon and the negatives have been sent to professor weinek of prague who makes enlarged drawings and photographs of them astronomers in copenhagen vienna great britain and other parts of europe are working with the lick astronomers star maps in both northern and southern hemispheres have been made at the lick observatory and photographs of the milky way the sun and its spots comets nebul mars jupiter etc professor holden has written much in the magazines the century mcclure the forum and elsewhere concerning these photographs what we really know about mars and kindred topics professor perrine discovered a new comet in february which for some time travelled towards the earth at the rate of miles per day professor david p todd of amherst college was enabled to make at the lick observatory the finest photographs ever made of the transit of venus dec as there will not be another transit of venus till jan so that no living astronomer will ever behold another this transit was of special importance the transit of mercury was also observed in by professor holden and others the equipment at the lick observatory is admirable and the sight excellent but the income from the endowment is too small to allow the desired work there are but seven observers at mount hamilton while at greenwich at paris and other observatories there are from forty to fifty men the total income for salaries and all other expenses is at the lick observatory at paris greenwich harvard college the united states naval observatory at washington etc from to is spent yearly and is all useful fellowships producing a year are greatly needed to be named after the givers and the money to provide a larger force of astronomers mr lick great gift has been nobly begun but funds are necessary to carry on the work leland stanford and his university the biographer of leland stanford will have to tell the fascinating story of a career almost matchless in the splendor of its incidents it was partly due to the circumstances of his time but chiefly due to the largeness and boldness of his nature that this plain simple man succeeded in cutting so broad a swath he lived at the top of his possibilities thus wrote dr albert shaw in the review of reviews august leland stanford farmeroy lawyer railroad builder governor united states senator and munificent giver was born at watervliet n y eight miles from albany march he was the fourth son in a family of seven sons and one daughter the latter dying in infancy his father josiah stanford was a native of massachusetts but moved with his parents to the state of new york when he was a boy he became a successful farmer calling his farm by the attractive name of elm grove he had the energy and industry which it seems leland inherited he built roads and bridges in the neighborhood and was an earnest advocate of dewitt clinton scheme of the erie canal connecting the great lakes with new york city by way of the hudson river gouverneur morris had first suggested the erie canal in says t w higginson and washington had indeed proposed a system of such waterways in but the first actual work of this kind in the united states was that dug around turner falls in massachusetts soon after in dewitt clinton again proposed the erie canal it was begun in and opened july being cut mainly through a wilderness the effect produced on public opinion was absolutely startling when men found that the time from albany to buffalo was reduced onealf and that the freight on a ton of merchandise was cut down from to and ultimately to similar enterprises sprang into being everywhere illustration leland stanford people were not excited over canals only everybody was interested about the coming railroads george stephenson in the midst of the greatest opposition landowners even driving the surveyors off their grounds had built a road from liverpool to manchester england which was opened sept the previous month august the mohawk and hudson river railroad from albany to schenectady sixteen miles was commenced a charter having been granted sometime before this josiah stanford was greatly interested in this enterprise and took large contracts for grading men at the stanford home talked of the great future of railroads in america and even prophesied a road to oregon young as he was when the question of a railroad to oregon was first agitated says a writer leland stanford took a lively interest in the measure among its chief advocates at that early day was mr whitney one of the engineers in the construction of the mohawk and hudson river railway on one occasion when whitney passed the night at elm grove leland being then thirteen years of age the conversation ran largely on this overland railway project and the effect upon the mind of such a boy may be readily imagined the remembrance of that night discussion between whitney and his father never left him but bore the grandest fruits the cheerful bigearted boy worked on his father farm with his brothers rising at five olock even on cold winter mornings that he might get his work done before school hours he himself tells how he earned his first dollar i was about six years old he said two of my brothers and i gathered a lot of horseradish from the garden washed it clean took it to schenectady and sold it i got two of the six shillings received i was very proud of my money my next financial venture was two years later our hired man came from albany and told us chestnuts were high the boys had a lot of them on hand which we had gathered in the fall we hurried off to market with them and sold them for twentyive dollars that was a good deal of money when grown men were getting only two shillings a day perhaps the boy felt that he should not always like to work on the farm for he had made up his mind to get an education if possible when he was eighteen his father bought a piece of woodland and told him if he would cut off the timber he might have the money received for it he immediately hired several persons to help him and together they cut and piled cords of wood which leland sold to the mohawk and hudson river railroad at a profit of after using some of this money to pay for his schooling at an academy at clinton n y he went to albany and for three years studied law with the firm of wheaton doolittle hadley he disliked greek and latin but was fond of science particularly geology and chemistry and was a great reader especially of the newspapers he attended all the lectures attainable and was fond of discussion upon all progressive topics later in life he studied sociological matters and read john stuart mill and herbert spencer young stanford determined to try his fortune in the west he went as far as chicago and found it low marshy and unattractive this was in when he was twentyour years old the town had been organized but fifteen years and did not have much to boast of there were only twentyight voters in chicago in in the entire population was chicago had grown rapidly by but mosquitoes were abundant and towns farther up lake michigan gave better promise for the future mr stanford finally settled at port washington wis above milwaukee which place it was thought would prove a rival of chicago forty years later in port washington had a population of while chicago had increased to mr stanford did well the first year at port washington earning he remained another year and then at twentyix went back to albany to marry miss jane lathrop daughter of mr dyer lathrop a respected merchant they returned to port washington but mr stanford did not find the work of a country lawyer congenial he had chosen his profession however and would have gone on to a measure of success in it probably had not an accident opened up a new field he had been back from his wedding journey but a year or more when a fire swept away all his possessions including a quite valuable law library the young couple were really bankrupt but they determined not to return to albany for a home several of mr stanford brothers had gone to california in after the goldields were discovered and had opened stores near the miningamps if leland were to join them it would give him at least more variety than the quiet life at port washington the young wife went back to albany to care for three years for her invalid father who died in april the husband sailed from new york spending twelve days in crossing the isthmus and in thirtyight days reached san francisco july for four years he had charge of a branch store at michigan bluffs placer county among the miners he engaged also in mining and was not afraid of the labor and privations of the camp he said some years later the true history of the argonauts of the nineteenth century has to be written they had no jason to lead them no oracles to prophesy success nor enchantments to avert dangers but like selfeliant americans they pressed forward to the land of promise and travelled thousands of miles when the greek heroes travelled hundreds they went by ship and by wagon on horseback and on foot a mighty army passing over mountains and deserts enduring privations and sickness they were the creators of a commonwealth the builders of states mr stanford had the energy of his father he had learned how to work while on the farm and he had a pleasant and kindly manner to all said a friend of his after mr stanford had become the governor of a great state and the possessor of many millions the man who held the throttle of the locomotive he who handled the train worked the brake laid the rail or shovelled the sand was his comrade friend and equal his life was one of tender thoughtful compassion for the man less fortunate in life than himself the young lawyer was making money and a good reputation as well in the miningamps says an old associate mr stanford in an unusual degree commanded the respect of the heterogeneous lot of men who composed the mining classes and was frequently referred to by them as a sort of arbitrator in settling their disputes for them while at michigan bluffs he was elected a justice of the peace which office was the court before which all disputes and contentions of the miners and their claims were settled it is a singular fact with all the questions that came before him for settlement not one of them was appealed to a higher court leland stanford was at this time just as gentle in his manner and as cordial and respectful to all as in his later years yet he was possessed of a courage which when tested as occasion sometimes required satisfied the rough element that he was not a man who could be imposed upon his principle seemed to be to stand up for the right at all times he never indulged in profanity or coarse words of any kind and was as considerate in his conduct when holding intercourse with the rough element as though in the midst of the highest refinement mr stanford had prospered so well that in he purchased the business of his brothers in sacramento and went east to bring his wife to the pacific coast he studied his business carefully he made himself conversant with the statistics of trade the tariff laws the best markets and means of transportation he read and thought while some others idled away their hours he was deeply interested in the new republican party which was then in the minority in california he believed in it and worked earnestly for it when the party was organized in the state in he was one of the founders of it he became a candidate for state treasurer and was defeated three years later he was nominated for governor but the party was too small to have any chance and the contest lay between opposing democratic factions mr stanford was to learn how to win success against fires and political defeats a year later he was a delegate at large to the republican national convention and instead of supporting mr seward who was from his own state of new york he worked earnestly for abraham lincoln with whom he formed a lasting friendship after mr lincoln was inaugurated mr stanford remained in washington several weeks at the request of the president and secretary seward to confer with them about the surest means of keeping california loyal to the union mr blaine says of california and oregon at this time jefferson davis had expected with a confidence amounting to certainty and based it is believed on personal pledges that the pacific coast if it did not actually join the south would be disloyal to the union and would from its remoteness and its superlative importance require a large contingent of the national forces to hold it in subjection it was expected by the south that california and oregon would give at least as much trouble as kentucky and missouri and would thus indirectly but powerfully aid the southern cause in the spring of mr stanford was again nominated by the republicans for governor though he declined at first after he had consented with his usual vigor earnestness and perseverance with faith in himself and his fellowen as well he and his friends made a thorough and spirited canvass and mr stanford received votes about six times as many as were given him two years before the period says the san francisco chronicle was one of unexampled difficulty of administration and to add to the embarrassments occasioned by the civil war the city of sacramento and a vast area of the valley were inundated on the day appointed for the inauguration the streets of sacramento were swept by a flood and mr stanford and his friends were compelled to go and return to the capitol in boats the messages of governor stanford and indeed all his state papers indicated wide information great commonense and a comprehensive grasp of state and national affairs remarkable in one who had never before held office under either the state or national government during his administration he kept up constant and cordial intercourse with washington and had the satisfaction of leaving the chair of state at the close of his term of office feeling that no state in the union was more thoroughly loyal there was much disloyalty in california at first but mr stanford was firm as well as conciliatory the militia was organized a state normal school was established and the indebtedness of the state reduced onealf under his leadership as governor after the war was over governor stanford cherished no animosities when mr lamar name was sent to the senate as associate justice of the supreme court and many were opposed mr stanford said no man sympathized more sincerely than myself with the cause of the union or deprecated more the cause of the south i would have given fortune and life to have defeated that cause but the war has terminated and what this country needs now is absolute and profound peace lamar was a representative southern man and adhered to the convictions of his boyhood and manhood there never can be pacification in this country until these war memories are obliterated by the action of the executive and of congress mr stanford declined a relection to the governorship because he wished to give his time to the building of a railroad across the continent he had never forgotten the conversation in his father home about a railroad to oregon when he went back to albany for mrs stanford after being a storekeeper among the mines and she was ill from the tiresome journey he cheered her with the promise never mind a time will come when i will build a railroad for you to go home on every one knew that a railroad was needed vessels had to go around cape horn and troops and produce had to be transported over the mountains and across the plains at great expense and much hardship some persons believed the building of a road over the snowapped sierra nevada mountains was possible but most laughed the project to scorn and denounced it as a wild scheme of visionary cranks the huge snowlad chain of the sierra nevadas says mr perkins the senator from california who succeeded mr stanford whose towering steeps nowhere permitted a thoroughfare at an elevation less than seven thousand feet above the sea must be crossed great deserts waterless and roamed by savage tribes must be made accessible vast sums of money must be raised and national aid secured at a time in which the credit of the central government had fallen so low that its bonds of guaranty to the undertaking sold for barely onehird their face value in the presence of such obstacles no one seemed ready to undertake the work of building the railroad one of the persistent advocates of the plan was theodore j judah the engineer of the sacramento valley and other local railroads he had convinced mr stanford that the thing was possible the latter first talked with p huntington a hardware merchant of sacramento then with mark hopkins mr huntington partner and later with charles crocker and others a fund was raised to enable mr judah and his associates to perfect their surveys and the central pacific railroad company was formed june with mr stanford as president in mr stanford inaugural address as governor he had dwelt upon the necessity of this railroad to unite the east and the west and now that he had retired from the gubernatorial office he determined to push the enterprise with all his power neither he nor his associates had any great wealth at their command but they had faith and force of character the aid of congress was sought and obtained by a strictly party vote republicans being in the majority and the bill was signed by president lincoln july the government agreed to give the company the alternate sections of acres in a belt of land ten miles wide on each side of the railroad and per mile in bonds for the easily constructed portion of the road and and per mile for the mountainous portions the company was to build forty miles before it received government aid it was so difficult to raise money during the civil war that congress made a more liberal grant july whereby the company received alternate sections of land within a belt twenty miles on each side of the road or the large amount of acres per mile making for the company nearly acres of land the government was to retain to apply on its debt only half the money it owed the company for transportation instead of the whole the most important provision of the new act was the authority of the company to issue its own firstortgage bonds to an amount not exceeding those of the united states and making the latter take a second mortgage there is no question but the united states has given lavishly to railroads as the cities have given their streets free to street railroads but during the civil war the need of communication between east and west seemed to make it wise to build the road at almost any sacrifice mr blaine says many capitalists who afterwards indulged in denunciations of congress for the extravagance of the grants were urged at the time to take a share in the scheme but declined because of the great risk involved mr stanford broke ground for the railroad by turning the first shovelful of earth early in at times failure seemed inevitable says the new york tribune june even the stoutearted crocker declared that there were times when he would have been glad to ose all and quit but the iron will of stanford triumphed over everything as president of the road he superintended its construction over the mountains building miles in days on the last day crocker laid the rails on more than ten miles of track that the great railroad builders survived the ordeal is a marvel crocker indeed never recovered from the effects of the terrific strain he died in hopkins died twelve years before in with a silver hammer governor stanford drove a golden spike at promontory point utah may which completed the line of the central pacific and joined it with the union pacific railroad and the telegraph flashed the news from the atlantic to the pacific the union pacific was built from omaha neb to promontory point though ogden utah fiftywo miles east of promontory point is now considered the dividing line after this road was completed mr stanford turned to other labors he was made president or director of several railroads he southern pacific the california oregon and other connecting lines he was also president of the oriental and occidental steamship company which plied between san francisco and chinese ports and was interested in street railroads woollen mills and the manufacture of sugar foreseeing the great future of california he purchased very large tracts of land including vina with nearly acres the gridley ranch with acres and his summer home palo alto thirty miles from san francisco with acres he built a stately home in san francisco costing over and in his journeys abroad collected for it costly paintings and other works of art but his chief delight was in his palo alto estate here he sought to plant every variety of tree from the world over that would grow in california many thousands were set out each year he was a great lover of trees and could tell the various kinds from the bark or leaf he loved animals especially the horse and had the largest horse farm for raising horses in the world some of his remarkable thoroughbreds and trotters were electioneer arion palo alto sunol the flying filly racine piedmont that cost and many others he spent it is said in experiments in instantaneous photography of the horse and a book resulted the horse in motion which showed that the ideas of painters about a horse at high speed were usually wrong no one was ever allowed to kick or whip a horse or destroy a bird on the estate mr george t angell of boston tells of the remark made to general francis a walker by mr stanford the horses of the latter were so gentle that they would put their noses on his shoulder or come up to visitors to be petted how do you contrive to have your horses so gentle asked general walker i never allow a man to speak unkindly to one of my horses and if a man swears at one of them i discharge him was the reply there were large greenhouses and vegetable gardens at palo alto and acres of wheat rye oats and barley but the most interesting and beautiful and highly prized of all the charms at palo alto was an only child a lad named leland stanford jr he was never a rugged boy but his sunny generous nature and intellectual qualities gave great promise of future usefulness mrs sallie joy white in the january wide awake tells some interesting things about him she says his chosen playmate was a little lame boy the son of people in moderate circumstances who lived near the stanfords in san francisco the two were together almost constantly and each was at home in the other house he was very considerate of his little playfellow and constituted himself his protector when mrs sarah b cooper was making efforts to raise money for the free kindergarten work in san francisco suggested by felix adler in she called on mrs stanford and the boy leland heard the story of the needs of poor children putting his hand in his mother he said mamma we must help those children well leland said his mother what do you wish me to do give mrs cooper now and let her start a school then come to us for more and leland wish was gratified between this time and says miss lewis in the home maker for january mrs leland stanford has given including a permanent endowment fund of for the san francisco kindergartens she supports seven or more five in san francisco and two at palo alto a writer in the press says her name is down for a year for these schools and i am told she spends much more i attended a reception given her by the eight schools under her patronage and it was a very affecting sight to watch these four hundred children all under four years of age marching into the hall and up to their benefactor each tiny hand grasping a fragrant rose which was deposited in mrs stanford lap these children are gathered from the slums of the city it is far wiser to establish schools for the training of such as these than to wait until sin and crime have done their work and then make a great show of trying to reclaim them through reformatory institutions leland jr was very fond of animals mrs white tells this story one day when he was about ten years of age he was standing looking out of the window and his mother heard a tumult outside and saw leland suddenly dash out of the house down the steps into a crowd of boys in front of the house presently he reappeared covered with dust holding a homely yellow dog in his arms quick as a flash he was up the steps and into the house with the door shut behind him while a perfect howl of rage went up from the boys outside before his mother could reach him he had flown to the telephone and summoned the family doctor thinking from the agonized tones of the boy that some of the family had been taken suddenly and violently ill the doctor hastened to the house he was a stately old gentleman who believed fully in the dignity of his profession and he was somewhat disconcerted and a good deal annoyed at being confronted with a very dusty excited boy holding a brokenegged dog that was evidently of the mongrel family at first he was about to be angry but the earnest pleading look on the little face and the perfect innocence of any intent of discourtesy disarmed the dignified doctor and he explained to leland that he did not understand the case not being accustomed to treating dogs but that he would take him and the dog to one who was so they went doctor boy and dog in the doctor carriage to a veterinary surgeon the leg was set and they returned home leland took the most faithful care of the dog until it recovered and it repaid him with a devotion that was touching leland knowing that he was to be the heir of many millions was already thinking how some of the money should be used he had begun to gather materials for a museum to which the parents devoted two rooms in their san francisco home he was fitting himself for yale college was excellent in french and german and greatly interested in art and arch ology before entering upon the long course of study at college he travelled with his parents abroad in athens in london on the bosphorus everywhere with an open hand his parents allowed him to gather treasures for his museum and for a larger institution which he had in mind to establish sometime while staying for a while in rome symptoms of fever developed in young leland and he was taken at once to florence the best medical skill was of no avail and he soon died march two months before his sixteenth birthday his parents telegraphed this sad message home our darling boy went to heaven this morning the story is told that while watching by the bedside of his son worn with care and anxiety governor stanford fell asleep and dreamed that his son said to him father don say you have nothing to live for you have a great deal to live for live for humanity father and that this dream proved a comforter the almost prostrated parents brought home their beloved boy to bury him at palo alto on thanksgiving day thursday nov the doors of the tomb which had been prepared near the house were opened at noon and leland stanford jr was laid away for all time from the sight of those who loved him the bearers were sixteen of the oldest employees on the palo alto farm the sarcophagus in which leland jr sleeps is eight feet four inches long four feet wide and three feet six inches high built of pressed bricks with slabs of white carrara marble one inch thick firmly fastened to the bricks with cement in the front slab of this sarcophagus are cut these words born in mortality may leland stanford jr passed to immortality march electric wires were placed in the walls of the tomb in the doors of iron and even in the foundations so that no sacrilegious hand should disturb the repose of the sleeper without detection memorial services for young leland were held in grace church san francisco on the morning of sunday nov the rev dr j p newman of new york preaching an eloquent sermon the floral decorations were exquisite one bower fifteen feet high with four floral posts supporting floral arches a cross six feet high of white camellias lilies and tuberoses relieved by scarlet and crimson buds and pillows and wreaths of great beauty nature had highly favored him for some noble purpose said dr newman although so young he was tall and graceful as some apollo belvidere with classic features some master would have chosen to chisel in marble or cast in bronze with eyes soft and gentle as an angel yet dreamy as the vision of a seer with broad white forehead home of a radiant soul he was more than a son to his parents e was their companion he was as an angel in his mother sick room wherein he would sit for hours and talk of all he had seen and would cheer her hope of returning health by the assurance that he had prayed on his knees for her recovery on each of the twentyour steps of the scala santa in rome and that when he was but eleven years old he had selected catalogued and described for his projected museum seventeen cases of antique glass vases bronze work and terraotta statuettes dating back far into the centuries and which illustrate the creative genius of those early ages of our race such a youth wasted no time in foolish pleasures or useless companions like his father he loved history and sought out says dr newman the place where pericles had spoken and socrates died reverently pausing on mars hill where st paul had preached esus and the resurrection and lingering with strange delight in the temple of eleusis wherein death kissed his cheek into a consuming fire at the close of dr newman memorial address the favorite hymn of young leland was sung tell me the old old story from this crushing blow of his son death mr stanford never recovered for years young leland room in the san francisco home was kept ready and in waiting the lamp dimly lighted at night and the bedclothes turned back by loving hands as if he were coming back again the horses the boy used to ride were kept unused in pasture at palo alto and cared for for the sake of their fair young owner the little yellow dog whose broken leg was set was left at palo alto when the boy went to europe with his parents when he was brought back a corpse the dog knew all too well the story of the bereavement after the body was placed in the tomb the faithful creature took his place in front of the door he could not be coaxed away even for his food and one morning he was found there dead he was buried near his devoted human friend toots an old black and tan whom young leland had brought from albany was much beloved mr stanford would not allow a dog in the house save this one says a writer in the san francisco chronicle was an exception and he had full run of the house he was the envy of all the dogs even of the noble old great dane would climb upon the sofa alongside of mr stanford and forgetting a wellnown repugnance he would pet him and say here is always a place for you always a place for you the year following the death of young leland on nov mr stanford and his wife founded and endowed their great university at palo alto in conveying the estates to the trustees mr stanford said since the idea of establishing an institution of this kind for the benefit of mankind came directly and largely from our son and only child leland and in the belief that had he been spared to advise us as to the disposition of our estate he would have desired the devotion of a large portion thereof to this purpose we will that for all time to come the institution hereby founded shall bear his name and shall be known as the eland stanford jr university mr stanford and his wife visited various institutions of learning throughout the country and found consolation in raising this noble monument to a noble son nfinitely to be preferred to shafts or statues of marble and bronze this same year mr stanford friends fearing the effect of his sorrow and hoping to divert him somewhat from it secured his election by the california legislature to the united states senate he took his seat march just a year after the death of his son he did not make many speeches but he proved a very useful member from his good sense and counsel and kindly leaning toward all helpful legislation for the poor and the unfortunate he was relected march for a second term of six years he will be most remembered in congress for his landoan bill which he originated and presented to the senate the bill proposed that money should be issued upon land to half the amount of its value and for such loan the government was to receive an annual interest of two per cent per annum whatever may be thought by some of the practical utility of his financial scheme says mr mitchell a senator from oregon which he so earnestly and ably advocated and which was approved by millions of his countrymen for the loaning of money by the united states direct to the people at a low rate of interest taking mortgages on farms as security all will now agree it indicated in unmistakable terms a philanthropic spirit an earnest desire to aid through the instrumentality of what he regarded as constitutional and proper governmental influence not the great moneyed institutions of the country not the vast corporations of the land with several of which he was prominently identified in a business way but rather the great masses of producers he farmers the planters and the wageorkers of his country in this connection the suggestion of professor richard t ely in his book on socialism and social reform page might well be heeded after showing that germany and other countries have used government credit to some extent in behalf of the farming community and that new york state has been making loans to farmers for a generation or more he says a sensible demand on the part of farmers organizations would be that congress should appoint a commission of experts to investigate thoroughly the use of government credit in various countries and at different times in behalf of the individual citizen especially the farmer and to make a full and complete report in order that anything which is done should be based upon the lessons to be derived from actual experience mr and mrs stanford were much beloved in washington for their cordiality and generosity they gave an annual dinner to the senate pages with a gift for each boy of a gold scarfin or something attractive and at christmas a fiveollar goldiece to each also a luncheon each winter and gifts of money gloves etc to the telegraph and messenger boys every orphan asylum and charity hospital in washington was remembered at christmas mr sibley representative for pennsylvania relates this incident showing mr stanford habit of giving my partner and myself had purchased a young colt of him for which we paid him he took out his checkook drew two checks of each and sent them to two different city homes for friendless children and with a twinkle in his eye and broadly beaming benevolence in his features said lectric bell ought to make a great horse he starts in making so many people happy in the very beginning of his life mr daniels of virginia tells how mr stanford was observed one day by a friend to give to an inventor who was trying to apply an electric motor to the sewingachine mr stanford remarked this is the thirtieth man to whom i have given a like sum to develop that idea after mr stanford had been in the senate two years on may he and mrs stanford laid the cornertone of their university at palo alto on the th anniversary of the birthday of leland stanford jr in less than four years on october the doors of the university were opened to receive five hundred students young men and women for mr stanford had written in his grant of endowment to afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the university to both sexes in his address to the trustees he said the rights of one sex political or otherwise are the same as those of the other sex and this equality of rights ought to be fully recognized mrs stanford said to mrs white as they sat in her library at palo alto whatever the boys have the girls have as well we mean that the girls of our country shall have a fair chance there shall be no dividing line in the studies if a girl desires to become an electrician she shall have the opportunity and that opportunity shall be the same as the young men if she wishes to study mechanics she may do it mr stanford said in his address on the day of opening i speak for mrs stanford as well as for myself for she has been my active and sympathetic coadjutor and is corantor with me in the endowment and establishment of this university they had been urged to give their fortune in other directions as some persons believed that much education would unfit people for labor we do not believe said mr stanford and the world honors him for his belief there can be superfluous education as man cannot have too much health and intelligence so he cannot be too highly educated whether in the discharge of responsible or humble duties he will ever find the knowledge he has acquired through education not only of practical assistance to him but a factor in his personal happiness and a joy forever mr stanford desired that the students should not only be scholars but have a sound practical idea of commonplace everyay matters a selfeliance that will fit them in case of emergency to earn their own livelihood in an humble as well as an exalted sphere to this end he provided besides the usual studies in colleges for mechanical institutes laboratories etc there are departments of civil engineering mechanical engineering electrical engineering besides shorthand and typewriting agriculture and other practical work he wished to have taught in the university the right and advantages of association and coperation laws should be formed to protect and develop coperative associations laws with this object in view will furnish to the poor man complete protection against the monopoly of the rich and such laws properly administered and availed of will insure to the workers of the country the full fruits of their industry and enterprise he gave directions that no drinking saloons shall be opened upon any part of the premises he prohibited sectarian instruction but wished to have taught in the university the immortality of the soul the existence of an allise and benevolent creator and that obedience to his laws is the highest duty of man mr stanford said it seems to us that the welfare of man on earth depends on the belief in immortality and that the advantages of every good act and the disadvantages of every evil one follow man from this life into the next there attaching to him as certainly as individuality is maintained the object of the university is he said to qualify students for personal success and direct usefulness in life again he said the object is not alone to give the student a technical education fitting him for a successful business life but it is also to instil into his mind an appreciation of the blessings of this government a reverence for its institutions and a love for god and humanity mr stanford wished plain and substantial buildings built as needed and no faster urging the trustees to bear in mind that extensive and expensive buildings do not make a university that it depends for its success rather upon the character and attainments of its faculty mr stanford chose for the president of his university david starr jordan wellnown for his scientific work and his various books though a comparatively young man being forty years of age dr jordan had had wide experience he was graduated from cornell university in and for two years was professor at institutions in illinois and wisconsin in he was lecturer in marine botany at the anderson school at penikese and the following year at the harvard summer school at cumberland gap during the next four years while holding the chair of biology in butler university indianapolis he was the naturalist of two geological surveys in indiana and ohio for six years he was professor of zo logy in indiana university and for the six years following its president for fourteen years he had been assistant to the united states fish commission exploring many of our rivers and part of that time agent for the united states census bureau in investigating the marine industries of the pacific coast he had studied also in the large museums abroad dr albert shaw tells this interesting incident president jordan had once met the young stanford boy on the seashore and won the lad gratitude by telling him of shells and submarine life it was a singular coincidence that the parents afterwards heard dr jordan make allusions in a public address which gave them the knowledge that this was the interesting stranger who had taught their son so much and had so enkindled the boy enthusiasm his choice as president was an eminently wise one mr stanford wished ten acres to be set aside as a place of burial and of last rest on earth for the bodies of the grantors and of their son leland stanford jr and as the board may direct for the bodies of such other persons who may have been connected with the university mr stanford lived to see his university opened and doing successful work the plan of its buildings suggested by the old spanish missions of california was originally that of richardson the noted architect of boston but as he died before it was completed the work was done by his successors shepley rutan coolidge the plan contemplates a number of quadrangles in the midst of acres the central group of buildings will constitute two quadrangles one entirely surrounding the other says the university register for of these the inner quadrangle with the exception of the chapel is now completed its twelve onetory buildings are connected by a continuous open arcade facing a paved court feet long by feet wide or three and a quarter acres the buildings are of a buff sandstone somewhat varied in color the stoneork is of broken ashlar with rough rock face and the roofs are covered with red tile within the quadrangle are several circular beds of semiropical trees and plants
