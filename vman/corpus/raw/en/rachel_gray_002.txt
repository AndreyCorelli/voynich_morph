shop of richard jones they were one and all mightily indignant at the impudence of the opposite shop in coming there lady in a large black shabby straw bonnet in particular ay ay you may flare away ou may flare away she added knowingly wagging her head at it youl have none of my custom i can tell you an ounce of your four shilling best mr jones if you please coming mam diectly was the prompt reply i never heard anythink like it ever observed another lady with solemn indignation did the low fellow think we wanted his shop an indignant no was chorused around richard jones heart swelled and his throat too he was much moved gentlemen he began no ladies i mean adies i have always done my duty since i was a boy and with the help of god i mean to do my duty till i die pause and approving murmur and ladies i am no speechaker i say is this god forgive that villain opposite you know the story il not trouble you with repeating it all i say is this ladies if my customersl stand by me il stand by my customers stand by my customers he repeated looking round the shop with a triumphant eye and giving the counter a hearty thump with his fist and poor fellow you may be sure that he did mean to stand by his customers the oration proved very successful altogether the day was successful the two teapots remained vacant the teapot was thronged all jones liege subjects were anxious to prove their loyalty and though when the gas was lit jones could discern a few dark figures within his rival shop jones did not care he felt certain they were but some of the low creatures from the alley and be did not care the second day resembled the first and the third resembled the second jones felt quite satisfied that it was all right until he cast up his accounts at the end of the week to his surprise he found that his expenditure was barely covered and that somehow or other his gains had considerably lessened he reckoned over and over and still he came to the same result well aint of much consequence for one week he thought a little impatiently and he put the books by what the matter father asked mary looking up into his overcast face what the matter he echoed cheerfully why the matter is that you are a saucy puss hat what the matter and he chucked her chin and mary laughed but the next week examination revealed a still deeper gap jones scratched his head and pulled a long face it was not that he minded the loss for it was a trifling one after all but be had a secret dread and it stood in the background of his thoughts like a ghost in a dark room haunting him could it be as it possible hat his customers were playing him false hat they were deserting him nd he began to think and think and to remember how many pennyworths of this and of that he had sold to the children and how few shillings worth he had sold to the mothers well father and how this week asked mary jones rubbed his chin and looked at her fairly perplexed is wit was none of the brightest s to how he might best elude the question how this week he echoed well this week is like last week to be sure i wonder how that fellow saunders is a getting on law father don mind him said mary he low that what he is he low impossible for us to translate the scorn with which miss mary jones spoke it impressed her father spirited little thing he thought and he drew her fondly towards him and kissed her and mary fortunately forgot her question week after week passed and what had been a speck on the horizon became a dark and threatening cloud richard jones could not shut his eyes to the truth that his customers were deserting him even mary perceived it and spoke uneasily on the subject of which her father at once made light it business child he said and business is all ups and downs i have had the ups and the downs i must have spite this philosophic reflection mr jones could not help thinking he had rather more than his share of the downs he was embittered too by daily perceiving the defection of some staunch customer that lady in the large shabby black straw bonnet who had so spiritedly told the two teapots to flare away on the day of its opening was one of the first who forsook the teapot for its rival many followed her perfidious example but mr jones did not feel fairly cut up until he one evening distinctly saw rachel gray walk out of the opposite shop the stab of brutus was nothing to caesar in comparison with this blow to richard jones and he was thinking it over the next morning and stood behind his counter breaking sugar rather gloomily when rachel herself appeared mr jones received her very coldly she asked for a pound of sugar and no tea he said pointedly none toay quietly replied rachel but she saw that he knew all and she was too sincere to feign ignorance mr jones she said somewhat sadly i must go where i am told and do as i am bid but indeed why do you not keep better tea better tea better tea echoed mr jones in some indignation yes quietly said rachel better tea mr jones smiled an injured smile and rather sarcastically replied miss gray if you prefer that feller tea to mine youe welcome to leave your money to him and not to me ain because my daughter is prenticed to you that i expect nothink from you miss all i say is this don go there at night miss gray and buy your tea and then come here in the morning and buy your sugar that not giving a man your custom you know it ain don do it no offence meant but i like you miss gray plain spoken you see and he resumed the breaking of his sugar i prefer sadly said rachel when you know mr jones that i am no one now but must go by the will of another ndeed you wrong me jones knew he did but misfortune makes men wilfully unjust don mention it he interrupted ladies like new faces and he a young fellow and i am an old one and so there an end of it poor rachel looked much pained to be blamed by every one seemed her lot indeed mr jones she said i must do as mrs brown bids me and she says your four shilling black is not equal to his four and indeed mr jones i am sorry to say that others say so too mr jones did not reply one word he fell into a brown study at the close of it he sighed and looking up said earnestly miss gray let me have some of that tea will you and il see myself what it like of course you will said rachel brightening you shall have it directly irectly mr jones and without loss of time she hastened home and almost immediately appeared again bringing him the tea herself and earnestly declaring that she was sure he had only to taste it to set all right to which jones answered not a word but rather gloomily thanked her for the trouble she had taken when he was once more alone he smelt the tea shook his head and frowned then he put it away until evening came round when he gave it to mary and without further explanation simply told her that was the tea they were going to have this evening unconscious mary made the tea la father she exclaimed as she poured the boiling water upon it what beautiful tea youe got it quite fragrant is it he echoed faintly why of course it is she said pettishly i am sure that fellow opposite ain got nothink like it richard jones leaned his brow on his hand and checked a groan but when the tea was drawn when it was poured out when he raised the cup to his lips and tasted it the man courage forsook him he put down the cup and cried like a child father father exclaimed mary frightened and bewildered oh my darling he cried wee ruined lost hat tea is joseph saunders tea and he gives it for four shillings and it better than my five and i can give it nor i can get it neither he added despairingly for i have not got credit and little cash and i buy dear and dear i must sell or starve of this speech all mary understood was that the tea she had been making was tea from mr saunders shop she deliberately rose poured the contents of the teapot on the ashes in the hearth the contents of her own teacup then of her father quickly followed then she sat down folded her arms and uttered a grim there i only wish i could serve him so she added after a pause but what mary meant by this wish o pour out joseph saunders like his own tea seems rather a fantastic image even for hate he present writer does not venture to determine it all over sadly said jones we can compete with him il shut up shop and wel go to some other neighbourhood and live in our old way after all il not be a richer nor a poorer man than before my cousin left me the sixty pound you ain got no spirit cried mary turning scarlet with anger give in to that fellow have more spirit than that she added with mighty scorn her father attempted to remonstrate but the wilful little thing would not listen to facts or to reason she was sure saunders could not keep up much longer hat she was they had only to wait and wear him out alas it is very hard to tear out ambition and pride from the heart of man rich or poor in an evil hour richard jones yielded chapter and now alas fairly began the teapot downward course every effort of richard jones to rise only made him sink the deeper to use a worn out though expressive phrase he stirred heaven and earth to get better tea but the spell to conjure it forth was wanting jones had very correctly stated the case to his daughter e had not credit he had little or no cash what he purchased in small quantities he bought dear and he sold as he bought and thus unable to compete with superior capital and energy he declined day by day but if he fell it was not without a struggle he turned desperate and resorted to a desperate expedient he sold his goods at prime cost and left himself without profit but jones did not care all he wanted was to crush his opponent hat object accomplished and he once more sole master of the field he could make his own price and gradually retrieve lost time and heal the wounds received in the battle business requires a cool head competition has its limits beyond which yawns the bottomless pit of ruin jones lost his temper and with it his judgment not satisfied with the faint change for the better produced by the first measure he impatiently resolved to settle that saunders by a second and still bolder stroke he filled his shopindows with placards on which prices were marked with notes of admiration he pressed into his service a dozen of little boys whose sole business was to slip bills under doors and to throw them down areas or to force them into the hands of unconscious passengers and he crowned an these arts by selling under prime cost the customers could not resist this tender appeal to their feelings they came back one and all he teapot once more was full he two teapots was deserted and richard jones was triumphant we profess no particular regard for joseph saunders but we cannot deny that he played his cruel game skilfully and well he did not bring down his prices one farthing without emotion he saw his shop forsaken e knew his own strength he knew too the weakness of his enemy oh it that dodge you are after he thought thrusting his tongue in his cheek well then it has beggared many a man before you and we shall see how long youl keep it up hat all and to whosoever liked to hear saunders declared that mr jones was selling at loss and that he saunder could not afford to do so and was sorry the old man would be so obstinate where was the use when he could not go on nothing did jones more harm than this assertion and the knowledge that it was a literal truth for though people worship cheapness that goddess of modern commerce it is only on condition that she shall be a reality not a fiction that she shall rest on the solid basis of gains howsoever small not on the sand foundation of loss that certain forerunner of failure jones could not of course long keep up the plan of selling under cost he was obliged to give it up with it ceased his fallacious and momentary prosperity i thought so soliloquized saunders reader if you think that we mean to cast a stone at the great shop you are mistaken we deal not with pitiless political economy with its laws with their workings the great shop must prosper is in the nature of things and the little shop must perish is in their nature too we but lament this sad truth that on god earth which god made for all there should be so little room for the poor man for his pride his ambition his desires which he has in common with the rich man we but deplore what all alas know too well that the crown of creation a soul a man by god almighty mind fashioned and called forth into being by christ priceless blood purchased and redeemed to heaven should be a thing of so little worth y so much so very much less worth than some money in this strange world of ours few pitied richard jones in his fall his little ambition was remembered as a crime for success had not crowned it his little vanities were so many deadly sins for gold did not hide or excuse them to the dregs the unhappy man drank the latter draught which rises to the lips of the fallen when they see the world deserting them to worship a rival a usurper had invaded his narrow realm and crushed him his little story was a true page from that great book of history which we need not read to know how power decays or to learn of man fickleness and fortune frowns alas history if we did but know it lies around us as mankind lives in the meanest wretch we meet and perchance despise it is a bitter thing to behold our own ruin it is a cruel thing to look on powerless and despairing and both now fell to the lot of richard jones he had ventured all and lost all he was doomed e knew it every one knew it but alas the cup of his woes was not full mary had always been delicate one chill evening she took cold a cough settled on her chest sometimes it seemed gone then suddenly it returned again she felt very well she said and strange to say her father thought so too rachel was the first to see that something was wrong mary she said to her one morning what ails you your breath seems quite short la bless you miss replied mary in her patronizing way i am all right they were alone rachel looked at the young girl her eyes glittered her cheeks were red with a hectic flush her breathing was quick and oppressive the eyes of rachel filled with tears she thought of her little dead sister in her grave mary she said do not work any more toay o home mary looked up in her face and laughed he gay laugh of an unconscious child fearless of death why miss you are crying she exclaimed amazed am i said rachel trying to smile never mind mary go home r rather take this parcel to mrs jameson number three albert terrace it is a fine day he walk will do you good mary jumped up charmed at the prospect she tied her bonnettrings before the lookinglass and hummed the tune of meet me by moonlight alone mary was turned sixteen and vague ideas of romance sometimes fitted through her young brain when she was fairly gone rachel rose laid her work by put on her bonnet and shawl and quietly slipped round to the teapot ostensibly she wanted to buy some tea her real purpose was to call the attention of mr jones to his daughter state but strange to say rachel gray could not make him understand her his mind was full of the two teapots of the villany of that saunders of the world ingratitude of his misfortunes and his wrongs i dare say mary feels it too put in rachel of course she does miss gray f course she does the child has feelings and then you know miss gray if that fellow hadn a come there why you know we were getting on as well as could be i notice that she coughs said rachel why yes poor child she can get rid of that cough he growing you see and then you see that saunders and her breathing is so short interrupted rachel sure to be on account of the cough and as i was saying that saunders but mr jones don you think you had better see a doctor again interrupted rachel see a doctor exclaimed jones staring at her you don mean to say my child is ill miss gray i don think she is quite well mr jones replied rachel trembling as she said so he sank down on his seat behind the counter pale as death the obstinate cough the short breathing the hectic flush all rushed back to his memory unseen unheeded till then they now told him one fearful story with trembling hand he wiped away the drops of cold perspiration from his forehead the doctor must see her directly he said directly il go and look for him and youl send her round it nothing othing at all i am sure she growing you see but still it must be attended to you know t must be attended to a light laugh at the door interrupted him he turned round and saw mary looking in at him and rachel gray through the glass windows with another laugh she vanished rachel went to the door and called her back mary mary your father wants you the young girl came in and for the first time her father seemed to see the bright red spot that burned on her cheek the unnatural brilliancy of her blue eyes the painful shortness of her breath a mist seemed to fall from his eyes and the dread truth to stand revealed before him but he did not speak nor did rachel mary looked at them both wondering well what ails you two that you stare at me so she said pertly i am so hot she added after a while i think i shall stay at home as you said miss gray she went into the back parlour and sat down on the first chair she found at hand rachel gray and her father followed her in the poor child who because she had felt no actual pain had thought that she could not be ill now for the first time felt that she was so what ails you dear softly asked rachel bending over her as she saw her gradually turning pale la bless you miss gray i am quite well nly i feel so faint like and even as she spoke her head sank on the bosom of rachel he had fainted when mary recovered to consciousness she was lying on her bed up stairs rachel stood by her pillow at the foot of her bed mary caught sight of her father face ghastly pale between the two she saw a strange gentleman a doctor who felt her pulse put a few questions to her wrote a prescription and soon left i must go now said rachel but i shall come back this evening and bring my work jones did not heed her he looked stupified and like one bereft of sense but mary laughed and replied oh do miss gray come and take tea with us rachel promised that she would try kissed her and left with great difficulty she obtained from mrs brown the permission to return they on whom the light of this world shone not were rarely in the favour of mrs brown and only on condition of being home early did she allow rachel to depart before leaving she went up to her other chair he was not now quite so helpless as at first and did not require her constant presence or assistance though he still did not know her i shall try and not be too long away said rachel in a low voice never mind he muttered shaking his head never mind there a precious old fool for you said mrs brown laughing coarsely a flush of pain crossed rachel cheek but to have replied would have been to draw down a storm on her head she silently left the house she found mary feverish restless and full of projects she would get up early the next day and make up for lost time she remembered all the work she had to do and which she had unaccountably neglected her father shirts to mend her own wardrobe to see to the next room to clean up for a second lodger had never been found in short to hear her it seemed as if her life had only begun and that this was the day of its opening in vain rachel tried to check her soothingly mary talked on and was so animated and so merry that her father who came up every five minutes to see how she was could not believe her to be so very ill as miss gray thought or the doctor had hinted indeed when at nine rachel left and he let her down stairs he seemed quite relieved the child only growing he said to rachel only growing a little rest and a little medicine and shel be all right again but scarcely was rachel out of the door when she burst into tears my poor little mary she thought my poor little mary chapter it was rather late when rachel knocked timidly at the door mrs brown opened to her and there was a storm on her brow well mam she began well mam oh pray do not o not imploringly exclaimed rachel clasping her hands for her excessive patience had of late rendered mrs brown violent temper wholly ungovernable irritated by the very meekness which met her wrath she had with the instinct of aggression found the only vulnerable point of rachel er father this was indeed the heel of achilles all the shafts of the enemy railing that fell harmless on the childish old man rebounded on his daughter with double force deep and keen they sank in her hearty and every one inflicted its wound and thus it was that rachel had learned to look with terror to mrs brown wrath hat she now shrank from it with fear and trembling and implored for mercy but there is no arguing with illemper mrs brown would neither give mercy nor hear reason had she not lent twenty pound three and six to rachel was not rachel beholden to her for food shelter chemist bill and physician fees and should not therefore her will be rachel law and her pleasure be rachel pleasure poor rachel her patience was great but now she felt as if it must fail as if she could not even for the sake of a roof shelter endure more from one to whom no tie of love or regard bound her othing but the burdening sense of an obligation which she had not sought and for which she had already paid so dearly she clasped her thin hands he looked with her mild brown eyes in the face of her tormentor and her lips quivered with the intensity of the feelings that moved her to reply and repel insult and contumely and with the strength of will that kept her silent at length mrs brown grew tired for her illemper had this quality it was vehement not slow and irritating the infliction ceased achel remained alone mrs brown had taken possession of the room that had once been rachel thomas gray slept in the back parlour and in order to remain within reach of aid rachel slept on the floor of the front room in this room it was that mrs brown had left her softly rachel went and opened the door of her father room it was dark and quiet but in its stillness she heard his regular breathing e slept and little did he know how much that calm sleep of his cost his daughter she closed the door and sat down in her own room but she thought not of sleep the tempter was with her in that hour her heart was full of bitterness ull even to overflowing on a dark and dreary sea her lot seemed cast she saw not the guiding star of faith over her head she saw not before her the haven of blessed peace the words thy will be done fell from her lips they were not in her heart nothing was there nothing but wounded pride resentment and the sense of unmerited wrong in vain thinking of her tyrant rachel said to herself i forgive that woman forgive her freely she felt that she did not that anger against this pitiless tormentor of her life smouldered in her heart like the red coal living beneath pale ashes and rachel was startled and justly to feel that so strange and unusual an emotion anger against another had found place in her bosom and that though she bade it go it stayed and would not depart to be gentle is not to be passionless the spirit of rachel had been early subdued too much subdued for her happiness but it was too noble ever to have been quenched it still burned within her a flame pure and free though invisible but now alas the vapours of earthly passion dimmed its brightness and it was darkened with human wrath through such moments of temptation and trial all have passed and then it is indeed when we are not blinded by pride that we feel our miserable weakness a weakness for which there is but one remedy but then it is a divine one he strength of god that strength rachel now invoked de profundis from the depths of her sorrow she cried out to the lord not that her burden might grow less but that her strength to bear it to endure and forgive might increase eyen with it and strength was granted unto her it came not at once not like the living waters that flowed from the arid rock when the prophet spoke but slowly like the heavenly manna that fell softly in the silence of the night and was gathered ere the sun rose above the desert rachel felt h pure and blessed feeling hat her heart was free from bitterness and gall that she could forgive the offender to seventy times seven that she could pray for her ot with the liprayer of the selfighteous pharisee but with the heartfelt orisons of the poor sinning and penitent publican and again and again and until the tears flowed down her cheek she blessed god the sole giver of so mighty and superhuman a grace and well it was for rachel gray that she forgave her enemy that night well it was indeed that the next sun beheld not her wrath before that sun rose the poor erring woman had given in her account of every deed and every word uttered in the heat of anger rs brown had gone to her room strong and well she was found dead and cold in her bed the next morning a coroner inquest was held and a verdict of sudden death recorded and a will too was found in a teaaddy by which mrs brown formally bequeathed all her property to rachel gray as a proof said the will of her admiration and respect on hearing the words rachel burst into tears thank god that i forgave her she exclaimed thank god well indeed might she thank the divine bestower of all forgiveness the legacy was not after all a large one mrs brown annuity died with her she left little more money than buried her decently the ground lease of the house in which she had originally resided was almost out and the bequest was in reality limited to the present abode of rachel but invaluable to her indeed was the shelter of that humble home now her own for ever and when all was over when the grave had closed on one who not being at peace herself could not give peace to others when rachel and her father remained alone in the little house now hushed and silenced from all rude and jarring sounds safe from all tyrannical interference rachel felt with secret thankfulness that if her lot was not happy according to human weakness it was blest with peace and quiet and all the good that from them spring if a cloud still lingered over it it was only because looking at her father she remembered the unfulfilled desire of her heart and if on days otherwise now marked with peace there sometimes fell the darkness of a passing shadow it was only when she saw and felt too keenly the sorrows of others chapter richard jones still hoped mary was so young he would hope but it was not to be he had but tasted the cup of his sorrows to the dregs was he to drink it the earthly idol on which he had set his heart was to be snatched from him he was to waken one day to the bitter knowledge there is no hope how he felt we know not and cannot tell none have a right to describe that grief save they who have passed through it we dare not unveil the father heart we deal but with the external aspect of things and sad and bitter enough it was in a silent shop where the sugar seemed to shrink away in the casks where the teahests looked hollow where dust gathered on the counter on the shelves in the corners everywhere where all looked blasted and withered by the deadly upas tree opposite you might have seen a haggard man who stood there day after day waiting for customers that came not and who from behind his shop windows drearily watched the opposite shop always full thriving fattening on his ruin or who sadder sight to his eyes and heart looked at the little back parlour where on her sick bed his dying daughter lay mary as her illness drew towards its close became fanciful she insisted on having her bed brought down to the back parlour and would leave her door open in order to mind the shop she said if anything could hasten her father ruin this did it the few customers whom he had left gradually dropped off scared away by that sick girl looking at them with her eager glittering eyes he sat by her one evening in a sad and very bitter mood she was ill very ill and for three days not a soul had crossed the threshold of his shop his love and his ambition were passing away together from his life father querulously said mary why did you shut the shop so early for since her illness the young girl mind was always running on the shop where the use of leaving it open huskily answered jones unless it to see them all going to the two teapots opposite well but i wish you had not she resumed it looks so dull and so dark it is very likely that to please her richard jones would have gone and taken the shutters down but for a knock at the private door there miss gray said mary her face lighting richard jones went and opened it it was rachel gray the light of the candle which he held fell full on his face rachel was struck with its haggard expression you do not look well mr jones she said don i miss gray he replied with a dreary smile well that a wonder look here he added leading her into the shop where his tallow candle shed but a dim dull light look here he continued raising it high and turning it round so that it cast its faint gleam over the whole place look here there a shop for you miss gray how long ago is it since you and your mother and mary and i we settled that shop look at it now i say at it now look here and he thrust the light down a cask empty look there and he raised the lid of a teahest empty do you wish to try the drawers oh they are all labelled but what in miss gray nothing it well the customers have left off coming for i couldn serve them couldn accommodate them i am sorry to say and he laughed very bitterly i was happy when i came here he resumed i had hope i thought there was an opening i thought there was room for me i set up this shop i did it all up myself as you know every inch of it i painted it i put the fixtures in i drove every nail in with my own hand and what been the upshot of it all miss gray rachel raised her soft brown eyes to his it is the will of god she said and god knows best for he is good richard jones looked at her and smiled almost sternly for suffering gives dignity to the meanest and no man when he feels deeply is the same man as when his feelings are unstirred miss gray he said i have worked from my youth laved some would say i hoped to make out something for myself and my child and it was more of her than of myself i thought i wronged none i did my best a rich man steps in and i am bewared nd you tell me god is good ind i don say he aint ut is he good to me rachel gray shook with nervous emotion from head to foot she was pained she was distressed at the question still more distressed because her mind was so bewildered because her ideas were in such strange tumult that with the most ardent wish to speak she could not as when in a dream we struggle to move and cannot our will being fettered by the slumber of the body so rachel felt then so alas for her torment she felt almost always conscious of truths sublime beautiful and consoling but unable to express them in speech god is good she said again clinging to that truth as to her anchor of safety again richard jones smiled and my child miss gray he said lowering his voice so that his words could not reach the next room going by inches before my very eyes yet i must look on and not go mad i must be beggared and i must bear it i must become childless and i must bear it and the wicked thrive and the wicked children outlive them for god is good to them miss gray the eyes of rachel filled with tears her brow became clouded ah mr jones she said do not complain you have loved your child what are you keeping miss gray there for pettishly said the voice of mary i want her and here i am dear said rachel going in to her i am come to sit a while with you for i am sure your poor father wants rest does he not i don want any one to sit with me impatiently replied mary i am not so ill as all that but do you sleep at night no i can am so feverish well then we sit up with you to keep you company said her father this explanation apparently satisfied mary who began to talk of other things she knew not she was dying whence should the knowledge have come to a mere child like her none had told her the truth and she was passing away into eternity unconscious er heart her thoughts her soul full of the shadows of life rachel saw and knew it and it grieved her she remembered her little sister happy and smiling deathed and from her heart she prayed that a similar blessing might crown the last hours of little mary that she might go to her god like a child to her father and when richard jones after sitting up with them until twelve went upstairs to rest awhile and rachel heard mary talk of her recovery and of projects and hopes vain to her as a dream she could not help feeling that it was her duty to speak they were alone yes now thought rachel now is the time to speak oh hard and bitter task to tell the young of death the hoping that they must not hope to tell those who would so fondly delay and linger in this valley that they must depart for the land that is so near and that seems so far rachel knew not how to begin mary opened the subject i shall be glad when i am well again she said i am tired of this little room it seems so dull when i see the sun shine in the street don it miss gray i dare say it does you remind me of a little story i once read shall i tell it to you oh yes you may carelessly replied mary yawning slightly she thought miss gray prosy at times it is not a long story said rachel timidly and here it is a king was once hunting alone in a wood when he heard a very beautiful voice singing very sweetly he went on and saw a poor leper what a leper interrupted mary don you remember the lepers in the gospel who were made clean by our saviour they were poor things who had a bad and loathsome complaint and this man whom the king heard singing was one and the king could not help saying to him ow can you sing when you seem in so wretched a condition but the leper replied t is because i am in this state that i sing for as my body decays i know that the hour of my deliverance draws nigh that i shall leave this miserable world and go to my lord and my god mary looked at rachel surprised at the impressive and earnest tone with which she spoke well but miss gray she said at length what is there like me in this story i am not a leper am i we are all lepers gently said rachel for we are all sinners and sin is to the soul what leprosy is to the body it defiles it and we all should be glad to die for christ has conquered death and with death sin ends and our true life the life in god begins mary raised herself on one elbow she looked at rachel fixedly earnestly miss gray she said what do you mean rachel did not reply he could not why do you tell me all these things continued mary and still rachel could not speak miss gray said mary am i going to die she looked wistfully in rachel face and the beseeching tone of her young childish voice seemed to pierce rachel heart but she had began could not she dared not go back she rose she clasped her hands she trembled from head to foot tears streamed down her cheek her voice faltered so that she could scarcely speak but she mastered it clear and distinct the words came out mary we must all obey the will of god we came into this world at his will at his will we must leave it and must i leave it miss gray asked mary persisting in her questioning like a child rachel stooped over her the fast tears poured from her face on mary pale brow yes my darling she said softly yes you must leave this miserable earth of trouble and sorrow and go to god your friend and your father the weakest the frailest creatures often rise to heroic courage this fretful pettish child heard her sentence with some wonder but apparently without sorrow don cry miss gray she said i don cry but do you know it seems so odd that i should die doesn it now rachel did not reply nor did she attempt it her very heart was wrung mary guessed or saw it i wish you would not fret she said i wish you would not miss gray i don you see ay thought rachel you do not my poor child for what do you know of death and a little while after this mary who felt heavy fell asleep with her hand in that of rachel gray chapter three days had passed the morning was gray and dull he had sat up all night by mary for rachel exhausted with fatigue had been unable to come poor little mary her hour was nigh she knew it and her young heart grieved for her father so soon to be childless she thought of herself too she looked over the whole of her young life and she saw its transgressions and its sins with a sorrow free from faithless dismay for rachel had said to her shall we dare to limit for ourselves or for others the unfathomed mercy of god father she suddenly said i want to speak to you what is it my darling he asked bending over her fondly she looked up in his face her cheeks flushed with a deeper hectic her glassy eyes lit with a brighter light father she said i have been a naughty child have i not no o my little pet never indeed never i know i have been naughty father i ave been oh so cross at times but father i could not help it t least it seemed as if i could not y back ached so and indeed she added clasping her hands i am very sorry father very sorry he stooped still nearer to her he laid his cheek on her pillow he kissed her hot brow little mary half smiled you forgive me don you she murmured faintly forgive you my pet y darling yes pray do she said she could scarcely speak now there was a film on her eyes too he saw it gathering fast very fast suddenly she seemed to revive like a dying flame again she addressed him father she said why don you take down the shutters and with singular earnestness she fixed her eyes on his take down the shutters the question seemed a stab sent through his very heart yet he mastered himself and replied is early yet is very early my darling no aint she said in her old pettish way and then she murmured in a low and humbled tone ah i forget forget i did not mean to be cross again indeed i did not father so pray forgive me don think of it my pet do you wish for anything nothing father but that you would take down the shutters he tried to speak e could not only a few broken sounds gasped on his lips for utterance because you see she continued with strange earnestness the customers will all be coming and wondering if they see the shop shut and they will think me worse and so nd so she could not finish the sentence but she tried to do so and so you see father again the words died away her father raised his head he looked at her he saw her growing very white again he bent and softly whispered my darling did you say your prayers this morning an expression of surprise stole over the child wan face i had forgotten she replied faintly i shall say them now she folded her thin hands her lips moved our father who art in heaven she said and she began a prayer that was never finished upon earth the dread moment had come the angel of death stood in that hushed room swiftly and gently he fulfilled his errand then departed leaving all in silence breathless and deep he knew it was all over he rose he closed the eyes composed the slender limbs then he sat down by his dead child a desolate man heartroken father how long he sat thus he knew not a knock at the door at length roused him mechanically he rose and went and opened he saw a man who at once stepped in and closed the door and before the man spoke jones knew his errand it all right he said i know the landlord could scarcely help it come in the bailiff was a bluff heartyooking man he gave jones a sound slap on the shoulder you are a trump that what you are he said with a big oath jones did not answer but showed his guest into the back parlour halloo what that cried the bailiff attempting to raise the bedurtain don said jones in a husky voice then the man saw what it was and he exclaimed quite ruefully i am very sorry am very sorry you can help it meekly said jones you must do your duty why that what i always say cried the bailiff with a second oath rather bigger than the first a man must do his duty mustn he and a third oath slipped out don swear pray don said jones and if i do may i be here the swearing bailiff paused aghast at what he was going to add i can help myself like he said rather ruefully it second natur you see second natur but il try and not do it try and speaking quite softly spite of his swearing propensities he looked wistfully at jones but the childless father face remained a blank make yourself at home he said in a subdued voice i think youl find all you want in that cupboard at least is all i have and he resumed his place by the dead all i want and all you have muttered the bailiff with his head in the cupboard then faith my poor fellow ain much the day was chill and very dreary the bailiff smoked his pipe by the low smouldering fire and yawned over a dirty old newspaper two hours had passed thus when jones said to him you don want for anything do you why no musingly replied the bailiff taking out his pipe and looking up from his paper thank you i can say i want for anything but what have you to say to a glass of grog eh he rather brightened himself at the idea il send for anything you like drearily replied jones and it was plain he had not understood as relating to himself the kindly meant proposal the bailiff rather stiffly said he wanted nothing well then resumed jones slipping off his shoes il leave you for awhile why where are you going cried the other staring there said jones and raising the curtain he crept in to his dead darling the curtain shrouded him in he was alone lone with his child and his grief a little child he had cradled her in his arms many a time had she slept in that fond embrace to her both a protection and a caress and now he looked at the little pale face that had fallen asleep in prayer he saw it lying on its pillow in deathike stillness and if he repressed the groan that rose to his lips the deeper was his anguish oh passion eloquent pages have been wasted on thy woes volumes have been written to tell mankind of thy delights and thy torments to no other tale will youth bend its greedy ear of no other feelings will man acknowledge the power to charm his spirit and his heart and here was one who knew thee not in name or in truth and yet who drank to the dregs and to the last bitterness his cup of sorrow oh miserable and unpoetic griefs of the prosaic poor where are ye elements of power and pathos of our modern epic the novel a wretched shop that will not take a sickly child that dies ay and were the picture but drawn by an abler hand know proud reader if proud thou art that thy very heart could bleed that thy very soul would be wrung to read this page from a poor man story and so he lay by his dead swelling with a tearless agony a nameless and twofold desolation gaze not on that grief ye of man thou art powerless to pity for thou art powerless to understand only think said a neighbour to mrs smith mr jones shutters have been closed the whole day i can think what the matter is can you replied mrs smith laughing why woman the shop is shut ay the shop was shut the shop which richard jones had opened with so much pride he shop which he had ever linked with his child closed on the day of her death and never reopened he did not care his little ambition was wrecked his little pride was broken his little cruise of love had been poured forth upon the earth by god own hand it was empty and dry arid sand and dust had drunk up its once sweet waters what a man without ambition pride and lore may be he had become in the one day that bereaved him pity not him reader his tale is told pity him whose bitter story of hope and disappointment but begins as i write and as you read for mortal hand has not sounded the bitter depth of such woes in them live the true tragic passions that else seem to have passed from the earth passions that could rouse the meekest to revenge and wrath if daily dew from heaven fell not on poor parched hearts as nightly it comes down from the skies above on thirsting earth chapter a time may come when the london churchyard shall be remembered as a thing that has been and is no more but now who knows it not who need describe the serried gravestones that mark the resting places in this sad field of death who need tell how they stare at busy passers by through their iron grating ow they look ghastly like the guest of the egyptian feast dead in the midst of tumult and riotous life dreary are they when the sun shines on them and their rank weeds the sun which those beneath feel not but more dreary by far when the drizzling rain pours down the dark church walls and filters into the sodden earth and in such a place and on such a day did they make the grave of mary jones two mourners stood by a woman and a man when all was over when earth had closed over the grave and its contents the man sat down on a neighbouring gravestone and looked at that red mound which held his all with a dreary stolid gaze of misery and woe rachel bent over him and gently laid her hand on his shoulder mr jones you must come she said he made no reply he did not rise and when she took his hand to lead him away he yielded without resistance she took him to her own house kindly and tenderly she led him like a little child and a child he seemed to have become helpless inert ithout will without power his own home was a wreck the prey of creditors who found but little there yet sufficient for their claims were few to save him from disgrace rachel gray gave him the room where his child once had slept where he had come in to look at her in her sleep and fondly bent over her pillow he burst into tears as he entered it and those tears relieved him and did him good at the end of two days he rallied from his torpor he awoke he remembered he was a man born to work to earn his daily bread and bear the burden of life he went out one morning and looked for employment something he found to do but what it was he told not rachel when she gently asked he shook his head and smiled bitterly it don matter miss gray he said it don matter no doubt it was some miserable poorly paid task yet he only spoke the truth when he said it mattered little he lived and laboured like thousands but he cared not for toay and thought not of toorrow the time of promise and of hope had for ever departed what though he should feel want so long as he could pay his weekly rent to rachel gray he cared not there is an end to all things and as for his old age should he grow old had he not the parish and the workhouse and so richard jones could drag on through life of all hopes save the heavenly hope forsaken but heaven chose to chastise and humble still further this already chastised and sorely humbled man he fell ill and remained for weeks on his sick bed a burden cast on the slender means of rachel gray in vain he begged and prayed to be sent to the workhouse or some hospital rachel would not hear of it she kept him she attended on him with all the devotedness of a daughter between him and her father she divided her time earnestly jones prayed for death the boon was not granted he recovered they sat together and alone one evening in the quiet little parlour alone for thomas gray was no one when there came a knock at the door and the visitor admitted by rachel proved to be joseph saunders mr jones is within hesitatingly said rachel and i just want to speak to him briefly replied saunders so that lucky he walked into the parlour as he spoke rachel followed wondering what was to be the issue on seeing his enemy poor jones reddened slightly but the flush soon died away and in a meek subdued voice he was the first to say good evening sorry to hear you have been ill said saunders sitting down but you are coming round ain you i am much better was the quiet reply got anything to do bluntly asked saunders nothing as yet answered jones with a subdued groan for he thought of rachel so poor herself and the burden he was to her well then mr jones just listen to me said saunders drawing his chair near i know you have a grudge against me you have ruined me said jones pshaw man was all fair all in the way of business exclaimed saunders a little impatiently you have ruined me said jones again but i forgive you i have long ago forgiven you and the shadow of a grudge against you or living man i have not thank god that all right enough emphatically said saunders still mr jones you say i have ruined you it isn the first time either that you have said so and with some people i may as well tell you it has injured me i am sorry if it has meekly said jones and i don care a button frankly declared saunders but as i was saying that your belief your impression and to be sure it true enough in one sense but then mr jones you should not look at your side of the question only mr smithson meant to set up a grocer shop long before you opened yours he spoke to me about it and if i had only agreed then it was done you came to be sure but what of that the street was as free to us as to you that i lodged in your house was an accident i did not know when i took your room that i should supplant you some day i did not know smithson had still kept that idea in his head and that finding no situation i should be glad to consent at last well i did consent and i did compete with you and knocked you over as it were but mr jones would not another have done it and was it not all honourable fair play well i suppose it was sadly replied jones and since it was a settled thing that i was to be a ruined man i suppose i ought not to care who did it come that talking sense said saunders with a nod of approbation and now mr jones wel come to business for i need not tell you nor miss gray either that i did not come in here to rip up old sores you must know that the young fellow who used to serve in my shop has taken himself off he going to australia he says but that neither here nor there i have a regard for you mr jones and having injured you without malice i should like to do you a good turn of my own free will and then there my wife who was quite cut up when she heard you had lost your little daughter and who has such a regard for miss gray but that neither here nor there the long and short of it is will you serve in my shop and have a good berth and moderate wages and perhaps an increase if the business prospers poor richard jones this was the end of all his dreams his schemes his anger his threatened revenge and yet strange to say he felt it very little every strong and living feeling lay buried in a grave his soul was as a thing dead within him his pride had crumbled into dust as mary would have said his spirit was gone the humiliation of accepting joseph saunders proposal nd however strange it was certainly well and kindly meant ichard jones did not consider he looked at the advantages and found them manifest there lay the means of paying rachel of covering his few debts and of securing to his wearied life the last and dearlyought boon of repose awhile he reflected then said aloud i shall be very glad of it lam very much obliged to you mr saunders well then it done said mr saunders rising good night jones cheer up old fellow good night miss gray jane sends her love you know sorry the old gentleman no better and away he departed very well satisfied with the success of his errand oh mr jones exclaimed rachel when she returned to the parlour don mention it he said with a faint smile i don mind it miss gray but could you not have stayed here she asked and be a burden upon you i that what i have done too long miss gray but until you found employment elsewhere you might have remained his house is as good as any his bread is not more bitter than another replied jones in a subdued voice besides now that my mary is gone what need i care miss gray and as he saw that her eyes were dim he added you need not pity me miss gray the bitterness of my trouble is and has long been over my mary is not dead for me she is and ever will be living for her old father until the day of meeting and whilst i am waiting for that day you do not think i care about what befalls me chapter once more rachel was alone once more solitude and the silence of the quiet street shrouded her in a new life now began for rachel gray like a plant long bent by adverse winds she slowly recovered elasticity of spirit and lightness of heart what she might have been but for the gloom of her youth rachel never was but as the dark cloud which had long hung over her rolled away as she could move speak eat and think unquestioned in her little home a gleam of sunshine pale but pure shone over her life with that lateon liberty her speech became more free her smile was more frequent her whole manner more open and cheerful rachel lived however both by taste and by long habit in great retirement and saw but few people indeed almost her only visitors were richard jones and madame rose the little frenchwoman now and then dropped in looked piteously at thomas gray shrugged her shoulders nodded winked and did everything to make herself understood but talk english and rachel listened to her and laughed gaily at the strange speech and strange ways of her little friend richard jones was a still more frequent visitor he came to receive not to give sympathy the society of rachel gray was to him a want of his life for to her alone he could talk of mary he spoke and she listened and in listening gave the best and truest consolation now and then not often for rachel felt and knew that such language frequently repeated wearies the ear of weak humanity she ventured to soothe his grief with such ailments as she could think of and her favorite one one which she often applied to herself and her own troubles was we receive blessings from the hand of god shall we not also take sorrow when it pleases him to inflict it very true miss gray very true humbly assented richard jones of his present position he never spoke unless when questioned by rachel and when he did so it was to say that saunders and his wife were very kind to him very kind and i am quite happy miss gray he would add quite happy and thus like a hidden stream flowed on the life of rachel gray silent peaceful and very still it slept in the shadow of the old grey street in the quiet shelter of a quiet home within the narrow circle of plain duties prayer love meditation and thought graced it daily it was humble and lowly in the eyes of man beautiful and lovely in the sight of god and thus quiet and happy years had passed away and nothing had arrested their monotonous flow it was evening rachel and her father were alone in the little parlour thomas gray was still a childish old man bereft of knowledge and of sense yet now as rachel helped him to his chair and settled him in it something a sort of light seemed to her to pass athwart the old man face and linger in his dull eyes father she cried do you know me in speech he answered not but it seemed to her that in his look she read conscious kindness she pressed his hand and it appeared to press hers in return she laid her cheek to his and it did not seem lifeless or cold then again she withdrew from him and said father do you know me he looked at her searchingly and was long silent at length he spoke and in a low but distinct voice said rachel in a transport of joy rachel sank at his feet and sobbing clasped her arms around him never mind rachel he said never mind father father she cried you know me say you know me but she asked too much it was but a dawn of intelligence that had returned never was the full day to shine upon earth never mind rachel he said again never mind but though the first ardour of her hopes was damped her joy was exquisite and deep her father knew her he had uttered her name with kindness in his feeble and imperfect and childish way he loved her what more then was needed by one who like the humble lover recorded by the italian poet had ever desired much hoped little nothing asked somewhat late that same evening richard jones knocked at rachel door as she opened to him the light she held shone on her face and though he was not an observant man he was struck with her aspect there was a flush on her cheek a light in her eyes a smile on her lips a radiance and a joy in rachel face which richard jones had never seen there before he looked at her inquiringly but she only smiled and showed him in and now reader one last picture before we part it is evening as you know and three are sitting in the little parlour of rachel gray an autumn evening it is somewhat chill with a bright fire burning in the grate and lighting up with flickering flame the brown furniture and narrow room and of these three who sit there one is a grey childish old man in an armhair another a man who is not old but whose hair has turned prematurely white with trouble and sorrow the third is a meek thoughtful woman with a book on her knees who sits silently brooding over the words her lips have uttered for she has been reading how the lord gives and how the lord takes away and how we yet must bless the name of the lord the good seed of these words has not been shed on a barren soil as richard jones sits and dreams of his lost darling he also dreams of their joyful meeting some day on the happier shore and perhaps now that time has passed over his loss and that its first bitterness has faded away perhaps he confesses with humble and chastened heart that meet and just was the doom which snatched from him his earthly idol and for a while took away the too dearly loved treasure of his heart and rachel gray too has her thoughts as she looks at her father and whilst thankful for what she has obtained as she yet longs perhaps for the full gift she never can possess if her heart feels a pang if repining it questions and says oh why have i not too a father to love and know me not imperfectly but fully ompletely a sweet and secret voice replies you had set your heart on human love and because you had set your heart upon it it was not granted to you complain not murmur not rachel if thou hast not thy father upon earth remember that thou hast thy father in heaven
