perhaps no other great poet in english literature has been so differently judged at different times as alexander pope accepted almost on his first appearance as one of the leading poets of the day he rapidly became recognized as the foremost man of letters of his age he held this position throughout his life and for over half a century after his death his works were considered not only as masterpieces but as the finest models of poetry with the change of poetic temper that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century pope fame was overshadowed the romantic poets and critics even raised the question whether pope was a poet at all and as his poetical fame diminished the harsh judgments of his personal character increased it is almost incredible with what exulting bitterness critics and editors of pope have tracked out and exposed his petty intrigues exaggerated his delinquencies misrepresented his actions attempted in short to blast his character as a man both as a man and as a poet pope is sadly in need of a defender toay and a defense is by no means impossible the depreciation of pope poetry springs in the main from an attempt to measure it by other standards than those which he and his age recognized the attacks upon his character are due in large measure to a misunderstanding of the spirit of the times in which he lived and to a forgetfulness of the special circumstances of his own life tried in a fair court by impartial judges pope as a poet would be awarded a place if not among the noblest singers at least high among poets of the second order and the flaws of character which even his warmest apologist must admit would on the one hand be explained if not excused by circumstances and on the other more than counterbalanced by the existence of noble qualities to which his assailants seem to have been quite blind alexander pope was born in london on may his father was a roman catholic linen draper who had married a second time pope was the only child of this marriage and seems to have been a delicate sweetempered precocious and perhaps a rather spoiled child pope religion and his chronic illealth are two facts of the highest importance to be taken into consideration in any study of his life or judgment of his character the high hopes of the catholics for a restoration of their religion had been totally destroyed by the revolution of during all pope lifetime they were a sect at once feared hated and oppressed by the severest laws they were excluded from the schools and universities they were burdened with double taxes and forbidden to acquire real estate all public careers were closed to them and their property and even their persons were in times of excitement at the mercy of informers in the last year of pope life a proclamation was issued forbidding catholics to come within ten miles of london and pope himself in spite of his influential friends thought it wise to comply with this edict a fierce outburst of persecution often evokes in the persecuted some of the noblest qualities of human nature but a longontinued and crushing tyranny that extends to all the details of daily life is only too likely to have the most unfortunate results on those who are subjected to it and as a matter of fact we find that the welloo catholics of pope day lived in an atmosphere of disaffection political intrigue and evasion of the law most unfavorable for the development of that frank courageous and patriotic spirit for the lack of which pope himself has so often been made the object of reproach in a wellnown passage of the pistle to arbuthnot pope has spoken of his life as one long disease he was in fact a humpbacked dwarf not over four feet six inches in height with long spiderike legs and arms he was subject to violent headaches and his face was lined and contracted with the marks of suffering in youth he so completely ruined his health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of and only the most careful treatment saved him from an early death toward the close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor undress without assistance he had to be laced up in stiff stays in order to sit erect and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings to protect himself against the cold with these physical defects he had the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill health and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal customs of the age pope enemies made as free with his person as with his poetry and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks the more bitterly of the two dennis his first critic called him a short squab gentleman the very bow of the god of love his outward form is downright monkey a rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in a coffee house where men of letters resorted and threatened to whip pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there it is said though perhaps not on the best authority that when pope once forgot himself so far as to make love to lady mary wortley montague the lady answer was a fit of immoderate laughter in an appendix to the unciad pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had pelted him an ape an ass a frog a coward a fool a little abject thing he affected indeed to despise his assailants but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled in his heart richardson the painter found him one day reading the latest abusive pamphlet these things are my diversion said the poet striving to put the best face on it but as he read his friends saw his features writhen with anguish and prayed to be delivered from all such diversions as these pope enemies and their savage abuse are mostly forgotten toay pope furious retorts have been secured to immortality by his genius it would have been nobler no doubt to have answered by silence only but before one condemns pope it is only fair to realize the causes of his bitterness pope education was short and irregular he was taught the rudiments of latin and greek by his family priest attended for a brief period a school in the country and another in london and at the early age of twelve left school altogether and settling down at his father house in the country began to read to his heart delight he roamed through the classic poets translating passages that pleased him went up for a time to london to get lessons in french and italian and above all read with eagerness and attention the works of older english poets penser waller and dryden he had already it would seem determined to become a poet and his father delighted with the clever boy talent used to set him topics force him to correct his verses over and over and finally when satisfied dismiss him with the praise these are good rhymes he wrote a comedy a tragedy an epic poem all of which he afterward destroyed and as he laughingly confessed in later years he thought himself the greatest genius that ever was pope was not alone however in holding a high opinion of his talents while still a boy in his teens he was taken up and patronized by a number of gentlemen trumbull walsh and cromwell all dabblers in poetry and criticism he was introduced to the dramatist wycherly nearly fifty years his senior and helped to polish some of the old man verses his own works were passed about in manuscript from hand to hand till one of them came to the eyes of dryden old publisher tonson tonson wrote pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of being allowed to publish them one may fancy the delight with which the sixteenearld boy received this offer it is a proof of pope patience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before accepting it it was not till that his first published verses the astorals a fragment translated from homer and a modernized version of one of the anterbury tales appeared in tonson iscellany with the publication of the astorals pope embarked upon his life as a man of letters they seem to have brought him a certain recognition but hardly fame that he obtained by his next poem the on criticism which appeared in it was applauded in the pectator and pope seems about this time to have made the acquaintance of addison and the little senate which met in button coffee house his poem the essiah appeared in the pectator in may the first draft of he rape of the lock in a poetical miscellany in the same year and addison request in that he compose a prologue for the tragedy of ato set the final stamp upon his rank as a poet pope friendly relations with addison and his circle were not however long continued in the year he gradually drew away from them and came under the influence of swift then at the height of his power in political and social life swift introduced him to the brilliant tories politicians and lovers of letters harley bolingbroke and atterbury who were then at the head of affairs pope new friends seem to have treated him with a deference which he had never experienced before and which bound him to them in unbroken affection harley used to regret that pope religion rendered him legally incapable of holding a sinecure office in the government such as was frequently bestowed in those days upon men of letters and swift jestingly offered the young poet twenty guineas to become a protestant but now as later pope was firmly resolved not to abandon the faith of his parents for the sake of worldly advantage and in order to secure the independence he valued so highly he resolved to embark upon the great work of his life the translation of homer what led me into that he told a friend long after was purely the want of money i had then none not even to buy books it seems that about this time pope father had experienced some heavy financial losses and the poet whose receipts in money had so far been by no means in proportion to the reputation his works had brought him now resolved to use that reputation as a means of securing from the public a sum which would at least keep him for life from poverty or the necessity of begging for patronage it is worth noting that pope was the first englishman of letters who threw himself thus boldly upon the public and earned his living by his pen the arrangements for the publication and sale of pope translation of homer were made with care and pushed on with enthusiasm he issued in his proposals for an edition to be published by subscription and his friends at once became enthusiastic canvassers we have a characteristic picture of swift at this time bustling about a crowded antehamber and informing the company that the best poet in england was mr pope a papis who had begun a translation of homer for which they must all subscribe for says he the author shall not begin to print till i have a thousand guineas for him the work was to be in six volumes each costing a guinea pope obtained subscribers many of whom took more than one set lintot the publisher gave pope for the work and agreed to supply the subscription copies free of charge as a result pope made something between and a sum absolutely unprecedented in the history of english literature and amply sufficient to make him independent for life but the sum was honestly earned by hard and wearisome work pope was no greek scholar it is said indeed that he was just able to make out the sense of the original with a translation and in addition to the fifteen thousand lines of the liad he had engaged to furnish an introduction and notes at first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him what terrible moments he said to spence does one feel after one has engaged for a large work in the beginning of my translating the liad i wished anybody would hang me a hundred times it sat so heavily on my mind at first that i often used to dream of it and do sometimes still in spite of his discouragement however and of the ill health which so constantly beset him pope fell gallantly upon his task and as time went on came almost to enjoy it he used to translate thirty or forty verses in the morning before rising and in his own characteristic phrase piddled over them for the rest of the day he used every assistance possible drew freely upon the scholarship of friends corrected and recorrected with a view to obtaining clearness and point and finally succeeded in producing a version which not only satisfied his own critical judgment but was at once accepted by the englishpeaking world as the standard translation of homer the first volume came out in june and to pope dismay and wrath a rival translation appeared almost simultaneously tickell one of addison little senate had also begun a translation of the liad and although he announced in the preface that he intended to withdraw in favor of pope and take up a translation of the dyssey the poet suspicions were at once aroused and they were quickly fanned into a flame by the gossip of the town which reported that addison the recognized authority in literary criticism pronounced tickell version the best that ever was in any language rumor went so far in fact as to hint pretty broadly that addison himself was the author in part at least of tickell book and pope who had been encouraged by addison to begin his long task felt at once that he had been betrayed his resentment was all the more bitter since he fancied that addison now at the height of his power and prosperity in the world of letters and of politics had attempted to ruin an enterprise on which the younger man had set all his hopes of success and independence for no better reason than literary jealousy and political estrangement we know now that pope was mistaken but there was beyond question some reason at the time for his thinking as he did and it is to the bitterness which this incident caused in his mind that we owe the famous satiric portrait of addison as atticus the last volume of the liad appeared in the spring of and in it pope gave a renewed proof of his independence by dedicating the whole work not to some lord who would have rewarded him with a handsome present but to his old acquaintance congreve the last survivor of the brilliant comic dramatists of dryden day and now resting for a time from his long labors pope turned to the adornment and cultivation of the little house and garden that he had leased at twickenham pope father had died in and the poet rejecting politely but firmly the suggestion of his friend atterbury that he might now turn protestant devoted himself with double tenderness to the care of his aged and infirm mother he brought her with him to twickenham where she lived till dying in that year at the great age of ninetyne it may have been partly on her account that pope pitched upon twickenham as his abiding place beautifully situated on the banks of the thames it was at once a quiet country place and yet of easy access to london to hampton court or to kew the five acres of land that lay about the house furnished pope with inexhaustible entertainment for the rest of his life he twisted and twirled and harmonized his bit of ground till it appeared two or three sweet little lawns opening and opening beyond one another the whole surrounded by impenetrable woods following the taste of his times in landscape gardening he adorned his lawns with artificial mounds a shell temple an obelisk and a colonnade but the crowning glory was the grotto a tunnel decorated fantastically with shells and bits of lookinglass which pope dug under a road that ran through his grounds here pope received in state and his house and garden was for years the center of the most brilliant society in england here swift came on his rare visits from ireland and bolingbroke on his return from exile arbuthnot pope beloved physician was a frequent visitor and peterborough one of the most distinguished of english soldiers condescended to help lay out the garden congreve came too at times and gay the laziest and most goodatured of poets nor was the society of women lacking at these gatherings lady mary wortley montague the wittiest woman in england was often there until her bitter quarrel with the poet the grim old duchess of marlborough appeared once or twice in pope last years and the princess of wales came with her husband to inspire the leaders of the opposition to the hated walpole and the miserly king and from first to last the good angel of the place was the blueyed sweetempered patty blount pope best and dearest friend not long after the completion of the liad pope undertook to edit shakespeare and completed the work in the edition is of course quite superseded now but it has its place in the history of shakespearean studies as the first that made an effort though irregular and incomplete to restore the true text by collation and conjecture it has its place too in the story of pope life since the bitter criticism which it received all the more unpleasant to the poet since it was in the main true was one of the principal causes of his writing the unciad between the publication of his edition of shakespeare however and the appearance of the unciad pope resolved to complete his translation of homer and with the assistance of a pair of friends got out a version of the odyssey in like the liad this was published by subscription and as in the former case the greatest men in england were eager to show their appreciation of the poet by filling up his lists sir robert walpole the great whig statesman took ten copies and harley the fallen tory leader put himself his wife and his daughter down for sixteen pope made it is said about by this work in swift visited pope and encouraged him to complete a satire which he seems already to have begun on the dull critics and hack writers of the day for one cause or another its publication was deferred until when it appeared under the title of the unciad here pope declared open war upon his enemies all those who had attacked his works abused his character or scoffed at his personal deformities were caricatured as ridiculous and sometimes disgusting figures in a mock epic poem celebrating the accession of a new monarch to the throne of dullness the unciad is little read toay except by professed students of english letters but it made naturally enough a great stir at the time and vastly provoked the wrath of all the dunces whose names it dragged to light pope has often been blamed for stooping to such ignoble combat and in particular for the coarseness of his abuse and for his bitter jests upon the poverty of his opponents but it must be remembered that no living writer had been so scandalously abused as pope and no writer that ever lived was by nature so quick to feel and to resent insult the undoubted coarseness of the work is in part due to the gross license of the times in speech and writing and more particularly to the influence of swift at this time predominant over pope and in regard to pope trick of taunting his enemies with poverty it must frankly be confessed that he seized upon this charge as a ready and telling weapon pope was at heart one of the most charitable of men in the days of his prosperity he is said to have given away one eighth of his income and he was always quick to succor merit in distress he pensioned the poet savage and he tried to secure patronage for johnson but for the wretched hack writers of the common press who had barked against him he had no mercy and he struck them with the first rod that lay ready to his hands during his work on the unciad pope came into intimate relations with bolingbroke who in had returned from his long exile in france and had settled at dawley within easy reach of pope villa at twickenham bolingbroke was beyond doubt one of the most brilliant and stimulating minds of his age without depth of intellect or solidity of character he was at once a philosopher a statesman a scholar and a fascinating talker pope who had already made his acquaintance was delighted to renew and improve their intimacy and soon came wholly under the influence of his splendid friend it is hardly too much to say that all the rest of pope work is directly traceable to bolingbroke the on man was built up on the precepts of bolingbroke philosophy the mitations of horace were undertaken at bolingbroke suggestion and the whole tone of pope political and social satire during the years from to reflects the spirit of that opposition to the administration of walpole and to the growing influence of the commercial class which was at once inspired and directed by bolingbroke and yet it is exactly in the work of this period that we find the best and with perhaps one exception the on man the most original work of pope he has obtained an absolute command over his instrument of expression in his hands the heroic couplet sings and laughs and chats and thunders he has turned from the ignoble warfare with the dunces to satirize courtly frivolity and wickedness in high places and most important of all to the student of pope it is in these last works that his personality is most clearly revealed it has been well said that the best introduction to the study of pope the man is to get the pistle to arbuthnot by heart pope gradually persuaded himself that all the works of these years the on man the atires epistles and oral essays were but parts of one stupendous whole he told spence in the last years of his life i had once thought of completing my ethic work in four books he first you know is on the nature of man the on man the second would have been on knowledge and its limits ere would have come in an essay on education part of which i have inserted in the unciad e in the fourth book published in the third was to have treated of government both ecclesiastical and civil nd this was what chiefly stopped my going on i could not have said what would have said without provoking every church on the face of the earth and i did not care for living always in boiling water his part would have come into my rutus an epic poem which pope never complete which is planned already the fourth would have been on morality in eight or nine of the most concerning branches of it it is difficult if not impossible to believe that pope with his irregular methods of work and illogical habit of thought had planned so vast and elaborate a system before he began its execution it is far more likely that he followed his old method of composing on the inspiration of the moment and produced the works in question with little thought of their relation or interdependence but in the last years of his life when he had made the acquaintance of warburton and was engaged in reviewing and perfecting the works of this period he noticed their general similarity in form and spirit and possibly under warburton influence conceived the notion of combining and supplementing them to form that greater essay on man of which he spoke to spence and of which warburton himself has given us a detailed account warburton a wideead pompous and polemical clergyman had introduced himself to the notice of pope by a defense of the philosophical and religious principles of the on man in spite of the influence of the freehinking bolingbroke pope still remained a member of the catholic church and sincerely believed himself to be an orthodox though liberal christian and he had in consequence been greatly disconcerted by a criticism of his poem published in switzerland and lately translated into english its author pierre de crousaz maintained and with a considerable degree of truth that the principles of pope poem if pushed to their logical conclusion were destructive to religion and would rank their author rather among atheists than defenders of the faith the very word atheist was at that day sufficient to put the man to whom it was applied beyond the pale of polite society and pope who quite lacked the ability to refute in logical argument the attack of de crousaz was proportionately delighted when warburton came forward in his defense and in a series of letters asserted that pope whole intention was to vindicate the ways of god to man and that de crousaz had mistaken his purpose and misunderstood his language pope gratitude to his defender knew no bounds he declared that warburton understood the better than he did himself he pronounced him the greatest critic he ever knew secured an introduction to him introduced him to his own rich and influential friends in short made the man fortune for him outright when the university of oxford hesitated to give warburton who had never attended a university the degree of pope declined to accept the degree of which had been offered him at the same time and wrote the fourth book of the unciad to satirize the stupidity of the university authorities in conjunction with warburton he proceeded further to revise the whole poem for which his new friend wrote notes and a ponderous introduction and made the capital mistake of substituting the frivolous but clever colley gibber with whom he had recently become embroiled for his old enemy theobald as the hero and the last year of his life was spent in getting out new editions of his poems accompanied by elaborate commentaries from the pen of warburton in the spring of it was evident that pope was failing fast in addition to his other ailments he was now attacked by an asthmatical dropsy which no efforts of his physicians could remove yet he continued to work almost to the last and distributed copies of his thic epistles to his friends about three weeks before his death with the smiling remark that like the dying socrates he was dispensing his morality among his friends his mind began to wander he complained that he saw all things as through a curtain and told spence once with a smile of great pleasure and with the greatest softness that he had seen a vision his friends were devoted in their attendance bolingbroke sat weeping by his chair and on spence remarking how pope with every rally was always saying something kindly of his friends replied i never in my life knew a man that had so tender a heart for his particular friends or a more general friendship for mankind i have known him these thirty years and value myself more for that man love than ere his head dropped and his voice broke in tears it was noticed that whenever patty blount came into the room the dying flame of life flashed up in a momentary glow at the very end a friend reminded pope that as a professed catholic he ought to send for a priest the dying man replied that he did not believe it essential but thanked him for the suggestion when the priest appeared pope attempted to rise from his bed that he might receive the sacrament kneeling and the priest came out from the sick room penetrated to the last degree with the state of mind in which he found his penitent resigned and wrapt up in the love of god and man the hope that sustained pope to the end was that of immortality i am so certain of the soul being immortal he whispered almost with his last breath that i seem to feel it within me as it were by intuition he died on the evening of may so quietly that his friends hardly knew that the end had come he was buried in twickenham church near the monument he had erected to his parents and his coffin was carried to the grave by six of the poorest men of the parish it is plain even from so slight a sketch as this that the common conception of pope as the wicked wasp of twickenham a bitter jealous and malignant spirit is utterly out of accord with the facts of his life pope faults of character lie on the surface and the most perceptible is that which has done him most harm in the eyes of englishpeaking men he was by nature perhaps by training also untruthful if he seldom stooped to an outright lie he never hesitated to equivocate and students of his life have found that it is seldom possible to take his word on any point where his own works or interests were concerned i have already p attempted to point out the probable cause of this defect and it is moreover worth while to remark that pope manifold intrigues and evasions were mainly of the defensive order he plotted and quibbled not so much to injure others as to protect himself to charge pope with treachery to his friends as has sometimes been done is wholly to misunderstand his character another flaw one can hardly call it a vice in pope character was his constant practice of considering everything that came in his way as copy it was this which led him to reclaim his early letters from his friends to alter rewrite and redate them utterly unconscious of the trouble which he was preparing for his future biographers the letters he thought were good reading but not so good as he could make them and he set to work to improve them with all an artist zeal and without a trace of a historian care for facts it was this which led him to embody in his description of a rich fool splendid house and park certain unmistakable traces of a living nobleman estate and to start in genuine amazement and regret when the world insisted on identifying the nobleman and the fool and when pope had once done a good piece of work he had all an artist reluctance to destroy it he kept bits of verse by him for years and inserted them into appropriate places in his poems this habit it was that brought about perhaps the gravest charge that has ever been made against pope that of accepting to suppress a satiric portrait of the old duchess of marlborough and yet of publishing it in a revision of a poem that he was engaged on just before his death the truth seems to be that pope had drawn this portrait in days when he was at bitter enmity with the duchess and after the reconcilement that took place unwilling to suppress it entirely had worked it over and added passages out of keeping with the first design but pointing to another lady with whom he was now at odds pope behavior we must admit was not altogether creditable but it was that of an artist reluctant to throw away good work not that of a ruffian who stabs a woman he has taken money to spare finally pope was throughout his life and notably in his later years the victim of an irritable temper and a quick abusive tongue his irritability sprang in part we may believe from his physical sufferings even more however from the exquisitely sensitive heart which made him feel a coarse insult as others would a blow and of the coarseness of the insults that were heaped upon pope no one except the careful student of his life can have any conception his genius his morals his person his parents and his religion were overwhelmed in one indiscriminate flood of abuse too high spirited to submit tamely to these attacks too irritable to laugh at them he struck back and his weapon was personal satire which cut like a whip and left a brand like a hot iron and if at times as in the case of addison pope was mistaken in his object and assaulted one who was in no sense his enemy the fault lies not so much in his alleged malice as in the unhappy state of warfare in which he lived over against the faults of pope we may set more than one noble characteristic the sensitive heart and impulsive temper that led him so often into bitter warfare made him also most susceptible to kindness and quick to pity suffering he was essentially of a tender and loving nature a devoted son and a loyal friend unwearied in acts of kindness and generosity his ruling passion to use his own phrase was a devotion to letters and he determined as early and worked as diligently to make himself a poet as ever milton did his wretched body was dominated by a high and eager mind and he combined in an unparalleled degree the fiery energy of the born poet with the tireless patience of the trained artist but perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of pope is his manly independence in an age when almost without exception his fellowriters stooped to accept a great man patronage or sold their talents into the slavery of politics pope stood aloof from patron and from party he repeatedly declined offers of money that were made him even when no condition was attached he refused to change his religion though he was far from being a devout catholic in order to secure a comfortable place he relied upon his genius alone for his support and his genius gave him all that he asked a modest competency his relations with his rich and powerful friends were marked by the same independent spirit he never cringed or flattered but met them on even terms and raised himself by merit alone from his position as the unknown son of an humble shopkeeper to be the friend and associate of the greatest fortunes and most powerful minds in england it is not too much to say that the career of a man of letters as we know it toay a career at once honorable and independent takes its rise from the life and work of alexander pope the long controversies that have raged about pope rank as a poet seem at last to be drawing to a close and it has become possible to strike a balance between the exaggerated praise of his contemporaries and the reckless depreciation of romantic critics that he is not a poet of the first order is plain if for no other reason than that he never produced a work in any of the greatest forms of poetry the drama the epic the lyric were all outside his range on the other hand unless a definition of poetry be framed nd dr johnson has well remarked that to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness of the definer hich shall exclude all gnomic and satiric verse and so debar the claims of hesiod juvenal and boileau it is impossible to deny that pope is a true poet certain qualities of the highest poet pope no doubt lacked lofty imagination intense passion wide human sympathy but within the narrow field which he marked out for his own he approaches perfection as nearly as any english poet and pope merit consists not merely in the smoothness of his verse or the polish of separate epigrams as is so often stated but quite as much in the vigor of his conceptions and the unity and careful proportion of each poem as a whole it is not too much to say that he rape of the lock is one of the bestlanned poems in any language it is as symmetrical and exquisitely finished as a grecian temple historically pope represents the fullest embodiment of that spirit which began to appear in english literature about the middle of the seventeenth century and which we are accustomed to call the classical spirit in essence this movement was a protest against the irregularity and individual license of earlier poets instead of faretched wit and fanciful diction the classical school erected the standards of common sense in conception and directness in expression and in so doing they restored poetry which had become the diversion of the few to the possession of the many pope for example is preeminently the poet of his time he dealt with topics that were of general interest to the society in which he lived he pictured life as he saw it about him and this accounts for his prompt and general acceptance by the world of his day for the student of english literature pope work has a threefold value it represents the highest achievement of one of the great movements in the developments of english verse it reflects with unerring accuracy the life and thought of his time ot merely the outward life of beau and belle in the days of queen anne but the ideals of the age in art philosophy and politics and finally it teaches as hardly any other body of english verse can be said to do the perennial value of conscious and controlling art pope work lives and will live while english poetry is read not because of its inspiration imagination or depth of thought but by its unity of design vigor of expression and perfection of finish y those qualities in short which show the poet as an artist in verse chief dates in pope life born may moves to binfield astorals on criticism

the stars inscribe belinda name contents of the essay on criticism part i introduction that is as great a fault to judge ill as to write ill and a more dangerous one to the public to that a true taste is as rare to be found as a true genius to that most men are born with some taste but spoiled by false education to the multitude of critics and causes of them to that we are to study our own taste and know the limits of it to nature the best guide of judgment improv by art and rules hich are but methodis nature id to rules derived from the practice of the ancient poets to that therefore the ancients are necessary to be studyd by a critic particularly homer and virgil to of licenses and the use of them by the ancients etc reverence due to the ancients and praise of them part ver etc causes hindering a true judgment pride imperfect learning to judging by parts and not by the whole critics in wit language versification only etc being too hard to please or too apt to admire partiality much love to a sect o the ancients or moderns prejudice or prevention singularity inconstancy etc party spirit envy etc against envy and in praise of goodature etc when severity is chiefly to be used by critics part ver etc rules for the conduct of manners in a critic candour modesty goodreeding sincerity and freedom of advice when one counsel is to be restrained character of an incorrigible poet and of an impertinent critic etc character of a good critic the history of criticism and characters of the best critics aristotle horace dionysius petronius quintilian longinus of the decay of criticism and its revival erasmus vida boileau lord roscommon etc conclusion an essay on criticism is hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in judging ill but of the two less dangous is th offence to tire our patience than mislead our sense some few in that but numbers err in this ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss a fool might once himself alone expose now one in verse makes many more in prose is with our judgments as our watches none go just alike yet each believes his own in poets as true genius is but rare true taste as seldom is the critic share both must alike from heav derive their light these born to judge as well as those to write let such teach others who themselves excel and censure freely who have written well authors are partial to their wit is true but are not critics to their judgment too yet if we look more closely we shall find most have the seeds of judgment in their mind nature affords at least a glimming light the lines tho touch but faintly are drawn right but as the slightest sketch if justly trac is by illolouring but the more disgrac so by false learning is good sense defac some are bewilder in the maze of schools and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools in search of wit these lose their common sense and then turn critics in their own defence each burns alike who can or cannot write or with a rival or an eunuch spite all fools have still an itching to deride and fain would be upon the laughing side if vius scribble in apollo spite there are who judge still worse than he can write some have at first for wits then poets past turn critics next and prov plain fools at last some neither can for wits nor critics pass as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass those halfearn witlings numous in our isle as halform insects on the banks of nile unfinish things one knows not what to call their generation so equivocal to tell would a hundred tongues require or one vain wit that might a hundred tire but you who seek to give and merit fame and justly bear a critic noble name be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dulness meet nature to all things fix the limits fit and wisely curb proud man pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid pow of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memory soft figures melt away one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit not only bounded to peculiar arts but oft in those confin to single parts like kings we lose the conquests gain before by vain ambition still to make them more each might his seval province well command would all but stoop to what they understand first follow nature and your judgment frame by her just standard which is still the same unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchang and universal light life force and beauty must to all impart at once the source and end and test of art art from that fund each just supply provides works without show and without pomp presides in some fair body thus th informing soul with spirits feeds with vigour fills the whole each motion guides and evy nerve sustains itself unseen but in th effects remains some to whom heav in wit has been profuse want as much more to turn it to its use for wit and judgment often are at strife tho meant each other aid like man and wife is more to guide than spur the muse steed restrain his fury than provoke his speed the winged courser like a genous horse shows most true mettle when you check his course those rules of old discovered not devis are nature still

strict his labour work confine as if the stagirite orlook each line learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem to copy nature is to copy them some beauties yet no precepts can declare for there a happiness as well as care music resembles poetry in each are nameless graces which no methods teach and which a masterand alone can reach if where the rules not far enough extend since rules were made but to promote their en some lucky licence answer to the full th intent propos that licence is a rule thus pegasus a nearer way to take may boldly deviate from the common track from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art which without passing thro the judgment gains the heart and all its end at once attains in prospects thus some objects please our eyes which out of nature common order rise the shapeless rock or hanging precipice great wits sometimes may gloriously offend and rise to faults true critics dare not mend but tho the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have mad moderns beware or if you must offend against the precept ner transgress its end let it be seldom and compell by need and have at least

vain wits a science little known t admire superior sense and doubt their own of all the causes which conspire to blind man erring judgment and misguide the mind what the weak head with strongest bias rules is pride the neverailing voice of fools whatever nature has in worth denied she gives in large recruits of needful pride for as in bodies thus in souls we find what wants in blood and spirits swell with wind pride where wit fails steps in to our defence and fills up all the mighty void of sense if once right reason drives that cloud away truth breaks upon us with resistless day trust not yourself but your defects to know make use of evy friend nd evy foe a little learning is a dangous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain and drinking largely sobers us again fir at first sight with what the muse imparts in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts while from the bounded level of our mind short views we take nor see the lengths behind but more advanc behold with strange surprise new distant scenes of endless science rise so pleas at first the towing alps we try mount or the vales and seem to tread the sky th eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attain we tremble to survey the growing labours of the lengthen way th increasing prospect tires our wanding eyes hills peep or hills and alps on alps arise a perfect judge will read each work of wit with the same spirit that its author writ survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind nor lose for that malignant dull delight the genous pleasure to be charm with wit but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow correctly cold and regularly low that shunning faults one quiet tenour keep we cannot blame indeed ut we may sleep in wit as nature what affects our hearts is not th exactness of peculiar parts is not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some wellroportion dome the world just wonder and ev thine o rome no single parts unequally surprize all comes united to th admiring eyes no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what ner was nor is nor er shall be in every work regard the writer end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spight of trivial faults is due as men of breeding sometimes men of wit t avoid great errors must the less commit neglect the rules each verbal critic lays for not to know some trifles is a praise most critics fond of some subservient art still make the whole depend upon a part they talk of principles but notions prize and all to one lov folly sacrifice once on a time la mancha knight they say a certain bard encounting on the way discours in terms as just with looks as sage as er could dennis of the grecian stage concluding all were despate sots and fools who durst depart from aristotle rules our author happy in a judge so nice produc his play and begg the knight advice made him observe the subject and the plot the manners passions unities what not all which exact to rule were brought about were but a combat in the lists left out what leave the combat out exclaims the knight yes or we must renounce the stagirite not so by heav he answers in a rag knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage so vast a throng the stage can ner contain then build a new or act it in a plain thus critics of less judgment than caprice curious not knowing not exact but nice form short ideas and offend in arts as most in manner by a love to parts some to conceit alone their taste confine and glitting thoughts struck out at evy line pleas with a work where nothing just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit poets like painters thus unskill to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover evy part and hide with ornaments their want of art true wit is nature to advantage dress what oft was thought but ner so well express something whose truth convinc at sight we find that gives us back the image of our mind as shades more sweetly recommend the light so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit for works may have more wit than does good as bodies perish thro excess of blood others for language all their care express and value books as women men for dress their praise is still he style is excellent the sense they humbly take upon content words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found false eloquence like the prismatic glass its gaudy colours spreads on evy place the face of nature we no more survey all glares alike without distinction gay but true expression like th unchanging sun clears and improves whater it shines upon it gilds all objects but it alters none expression is the dress of thought and still appears more decent as more suitable a vile conceit in pompous words express is like a clown in regal purple dress for diffent styles with diffent subjects sort as several garbs with country town and court some by old words to fame have made pretence ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense such labour nothings in so strange a style amaze th unlearn and make the learned smile unlucky as fungoso in the play these sparks with awkward vanity display what the fine gentleman wore yesterday and but so mimic ancient wits at best as apes our grandsires in their doublets drest in words as fashions the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are try nor yet the last to lay the old aside but most by numbers judge a poet song and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire her voice is all these tuneful fools admire who haunt parnassus but to please their ear not mend their minds as some to church repair not for the doctrine but the music there these equal syllables alone require tho oft the ear the open vowe tire while expletives their feeble aid do join and ten low words oft creep in one dull line while they ring round the same unvary chimes with sure returns of still expected rhymes wherer you find the cooling western breeze in the next line it whispers through the trees if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep the reader threaten not in vai with sleep then at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call a thought a needless alexandrine ends the song that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know what roundly smooth or languishingly slow and praise the easy vigour of a line where denham strength and waller sweetness join true ease in writing comes from art not chance as those move easiest who have learn to dance is not enough no harshness gives offence the sound must seem an echo to the sense soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows but when loud surges lash the sounding shore the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar when ajax strives some rock vast weight to throw the line too labours and the words move slow not so when swift camilla scours the plain flies or th unbending corn and skims along the main hear how timotheus varied lays surprize and bid alternate passions fall and rise while at each change the son of libyan jove now burns with glory and then melts with love now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow persians and greeks like turns of nature found and the world victor stood subdu by sound the pow of music all our hearts allow and what timotheus was is dryden now avoid extremes and shun the fault of such who still are pleas too little or too much at evy trifle scorn to take offence that always shows great pride or little sense those heads as stomachs are not sure the best which nauseate all and nothing can digest yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move for fools admire but men of sense approve as things seem large which we thro mists descry dulness is ever apt to magnify some foreign writers some our own despise the ancients only or the moderns prize thus wit like faith by each man is apply to one small sect and all are damn beside meanly they seek the blessing to confine and force that sun but on a part to shine which not alone the southern wit sublimes but ripens spirits in cold northern climes which from the first has shone on ages past enlights the present and shall warm the last tho each may feel increases and decays and see now clearer and now darker days regard not then if wit be old or new but blame the false and value still the true some ner advance a judgment of their own but catch the spreading notion of the town they reason and conclude by precedent and own stale nonsense which they ner invent some judge of author names not works and then nor praise nor blame the writings but the men of all this servile herd the worst is he that in proud dulness joins with quality a constant critic at the great man board to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord what woful stuff this madrigal would be in some starv hackney sonneteer or me but let a lord once own the happy lines how the wit brightens how the style refines before his sacred name flies evy fault and each exalted stanza teems with thought the vulgar thus through imitation err as oft the learn by being singular so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng by chance go right they purposely go wrong so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damn for having too much wit some praise at morning what they blame at night but always think the last opinion right a muse by these is like a mistress us this hour she idoliz the next abus while their weak heads like towns unfortify wixt sense and nonsense daily change their side ask them the cause theye wiser still they say and still toorrow wiser than toay we think our fathers fools so wise we grow our wiser sons no doubt will think us so once schoolivines this zealous isle orpread who knew most sentences was deepest read faith gospel all seem made to be disputed and none had sense enough to be confuted scotists and thomists now in peace remain amidst their kindred cobwebs in duckane if faith itself has diffent dresses worn what wonder modes in wit should take their turn oft leaving what is natural and fit the current folly proves the ready wit and authors think their reputation safe which lives as long as fools are pleas to laugh some valuing those of their own side or mind still make themselves the measure of mankind fondly we think we honour merit then when we but praise ourselves in other men parties in wit attend on those of state and public faction doubles private hate pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons critics beaus but sense surviv when merry jests were past for rising merit will buoy up at last might he return and bless once more our eyes new blackmores and new milbourns must arise nay should great homer lift his awful head zoilus again would start up from the dead envy will merit as its shade pursue but like a shadow proves the substance true for envy wit like sol eclips makes known th opposing body grossness not its own when first that sun too powful beams displays it draws up vapours which obscure its rays but ev those clouds at last adorn its way reflect new glories and augment the day be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend short is the date alas of modern rhymes and is but just to let them live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchits surviv a thousand years now length of fame our second lif is lost and bare threescore is all ev that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has design some bright idea of the master mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colours soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing years their full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treachous colours the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away unhappy wit like most mistaken things atones not for that envy which it brings in youth alone its empty praise we boast but soon the shortiv vanity is lost like some fair flow the early spring supplies that gaily blooms but ev in blooming dies what is this wit which must our cares employ the owner wife that other men enjoy then most our trouble still when most admir and still the more we give the more requir whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease sure some to vex but never all to please is what the vicious fear the virtuous shun by fools is hated and by knaves undone if wit so much from ignance undergo ah let not learning too commence its foe of old those met rewards who could excel and such were prais who but endeavour well tho triumphs were to genals only due crowns were reserv to grace the soldiers too now they who reach parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down and while selfove each jealous writer rules contending wits become the sport of fools but still the worst with most regret commend for each ill author is as bad a friend to what base ends and by what abject ways are mortals urg thro sacred lust of praise ah ner so dire a thirst of glory boast nor in the critic let the man be lost goodature and goodense must ever join to err is human to forgive divine but if in noble minds some dregs remain not yet purg off of spleen and sour disdain discharge that rage on more provoking crimes nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times no pardon vile obscenity should find tho wit and art conspire to move your mind but dulness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as impotence in love in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease sprung the rank weed and thriv with large increase when love was all an easy monarch care seldom at council never in a war jilts rul the state and statesmen farces writ nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit the fair sate panting at a courtier play and not a mask went unimprov away the modest fan was lifted up no more and virgins smil at what they blush before the following licence of a foreign reign did all the dregs of bold socinus drain then unbelieving priests reform the nation and taught more pleasant methods of salvation where heav free subjects might their rights dispute lest god himself should seem too absolute pulpits their sacred satire learn to spare and vice admir to find a flatter there encourag thus wit titans brav the skies and the press groan with licens blasphemies these monsters critics with your darts engage here point your thunder and exhaust your rage yet shun their fault who scandalously nice will needs mistake an author into vice all seems infected that th infected spy as all looks yellow to the jaundic eye learn then what morals critics ought to show for is but half a judge task to know is not enough taste judgment learning join in all you speak let truth and candour shine that not alone what to your sense is due all may allow but seek your friendship too be silent always when you doubt your sense and speak tho sure with seeming diffidence some positive persisting fops we know who if once wrong will needs be always so but you with pleasure own your errors past and make each day a critic on the last is not enough your counsel still be true blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do men must be taught as if you taught them not and things unknown propos as things forgot without good breeding truth is disapprov that only makes superior sense belov be niggards of advice on no pretence for the worst avarice is that of sense with mean complacence ner betray your trust nor be so civil as to prove unjust fear not the anger of the wise to raise those best can bear reproof who merit praise were well might critics still this freedom take but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threating eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry fear most to tax an honourable fool whose right it is uncensur to be dull such without wit are poets when they please as without learning they can take degrees leave dangous truths to unsuccessful satires and flattery to fulsome dedicators whom when they praise the world believes no more than when they promise to give scribbling or is best sometimes your censure to restrain and charitably let the dull be vain your silence there is better than your spite for who can rail so long as they can write still humming on their drowsy course they keep and lash so long like tops are lash asleep false steps but help them to renew the race as after stumbling jades will mend their pace what crowds of these impenitently bold in sounds and jingling syllables grown old still run on poets in a raging vein ev to the dregs and squeezings of the brain strain out the last dull droppings of their sense and rhyme with all the rage of impotence such shameless bards we have and yet is true there are as mad abandon critics too the bookful blockhead ignorantly read with loads of learned lumber in his head with his own tongue still edifies his ears and always listing to himself appears all books he reads and all he reads assails from dryden fables down to durfey tales with him most authors steal their works or buy garth did not write his own dispensary name a new play and he

fools rush in where angels fear to tread distrustful sense with modest caution speaks it still looks home and short excursions makes but rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks and never shock and never turn aside bursts out resistless with a thunding tide but where the man who counsel can bestow still pleas to teach and yet not proud to know unbiass or by favour or by spite not dully prepossess nor blindly right tho learn wellred and tho wellred sincere modestly bold and humanly severe who to a friend his faults can freely show and gladly praise the merit of a foe blest with a

without method talks us into sense will like a friend familiarly convey the truest notions in the easiest way he who supreme in judgment as in wit might boldly censure as he boldly writ yet judg with

john lord bolingbroke the design having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners such as to use my lord bacon expressio come home to men business and bosoms i thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract his nature and his state since to prove any moral duty to enforce any moral precept or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in and what is the proper end and purpose of its being the science of human nature is like all other sciences reduced to a few clear points there are not many certain truths in this world it is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation the disputes are all upon these last and i will venture to say they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of morality if i could flatter myself that this essay has any merit it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over terms utterly unintelligible and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics this i might have done in prose but i chose verse and even rhyme for two reasons the one will appear obvious that principles maxims or precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterwards the other may seem odd but is true i found i could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness i was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail without becoming dry and tedious or more poetically without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament without wandring from the precision or breaking the chain of reasoning if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them i freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity what is now published is only to be considered as a general map of man marking out no more than the greater parts their extent their limits and their connection and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow consequently these epistles in their progress if i have health and leisure to make any progres will be less dry and more susceptible of poetical ornament i am here only opening the fountains and clearing the passage to deduce the rivers to follow them in their course and to observe their effects may be a task more agreeable p argument of epistle i of the nature and state of man with respect to the universe of man in the abstract i that we can judge only with regard to our own system being ignorant of the relations of systems and things that man is not to be deemed imperfect but a being suited to his place and rank in the creation agreeable to the general order of things and conformable to ends and relations to him unknown that it is partly upon his ignorance of future events and partly upon the hope of a future state that all his happiness in the present depends the pride of aiming at more knowledge and pretending to more perfections the cause of man error and misery the impiety of putting himself in the place of god and judging of the fitness or unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or injustice of his dispensations the absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation or expecting that perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural the unreasonableness of his complaints against providence while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the angels and on the other the bodily qualifications of the brutes though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable that throughout the whole visible world an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed which causes a subordination of creature to creature and of all creatures to man the gradations of sense instinct thought reflection reason that reason alone countervails fill the other faculties how much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend above and below us were any part of which broken not that part only but the whole connected creation must be destroyed the extravagance madness and pride of such a desire the consequence of all the absolute submission to the end due to providence both as to our present and future state epistle i awake my st john leave all meaner things to low ambition and the pride of kings let us since life can little more supply than just to look about us and to expatiate free or all this scene of

yield the latent tracts the giddy heights explore of all who blindly creep or sightless soar eye nature walks shoot folly as it flies and catch the manners living as they rise laugh where we must be candid where we can but vindicate the ways of god to man i say first of god above or man below what can we reason but from what we know of man what see we but his station here from which to reason or to which refer thro worlds unnumber tho the god be known is ours to trace him only in our own he who thro vast immensity can pierce see worlds on worlds compose one universe observe how system into system runs what other planets circle other suns what vary being peoples evy star may tell why heav has made us as we are but of this frame the bearings and the ties the strong connexions nice dependencies gradations just has thy pervading soul look thro or can a part contain the whole is the great chain that draws all to agree and drawn supports upheld by god or thee presumptuous man the reason wouldst thou find why form so weak so little and so blind first if thou canst the harder reason guess why form no weaker blinder and no less ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made taller or stronger than the weeds they shade or ask of yonder argent fields above why jove satellites are less than jove of systems possible if is confest that wisdom infinite must form the best where all must full or not coherent be and all that rises rise in due degree then in the scale of reasing life is plain there must be somewhere such a rank as man and all the question wrangle er so lon is only this if god has plac him wrong respecting man whatever wrong we call may must be right as relative to all in human works tho labour on with pain a thousand movements scarce one purpose gain in god one single can its end produce yet serves to second too some other use so man who here seems principal alone perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown touches some wheel or verges to some goal is but a

advertisement to the first publication of this epistle this paper is a sort of bill of complaint begun many years since and drawn up by snatches as the several occasions offered i had no thoughts of publishing it till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune the authors of verses to the imitator of horace and of an epistle to a doctor of divinity from a nobleman at hampton court to attack in a very extraordinary manner not only my writings of which being public the public is judg but my p erson morals and family whereof to those who know me not a truer information may be requisite being divided between the necessity to say something of myself and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task i thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle if it have any thing pleasing it will be that by which i am most desirous to please the truth and the sentiment and if any thing offensive it will be only to those i am least sorry to offend the vicious or the ungenerous many will know their own pictures in it there being not a circumstance but what is true but i have for the most part spared their names and they may escape being laughed at if they please i would have some of them know it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed that i make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine however i shall have this advantage and honour on my side that whereas by their proceeding any abuse may be directed at any man no injury can possibly be done by mine since a nameless character can never be found out but by its truth and likeness p p shut shut the door good john fatigu i said tie up the knocker say i sick i dead the dogtar rages nay is past a doubt all bedlam or parnassus is let out fire in each eye and

from hardound brains eight lines a year he who still wanting tho he lives on theft steals much spends little yet has nothing left and he who now to sense now nonsense leaning means not but blunders round about a meaning and he whose fustian so sublimely bad it is not poetry but prose run mad all these my modest satire bade translate and own that nine such poets made a tate how did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe and swear not addison himself was safe peace to all such but were there one whose fires true genius kindles and fair fame inspires blest with each talent and each art to
