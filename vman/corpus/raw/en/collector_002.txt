attractive doctors hrow physic to the dogs acbeth riend of my life which did not you prolong the world had wanted many an idle song ope in the moving panoramas of cities are to be seen certain vehicles of all degrees of locomotive beauty and convenience from the glossy and silvernobbed carriage with its prancing grays to the bacheloricooking sulky with its one gaunt horse in which are seated gentlemen of a learned and professional aspect usually wearing spectacles and always an air of intense respectability or of contemplation and seriousness they recognize numerous acquaintances as they pass with a peculiar smile and nod and are usually accompanied by little manoy to hold the horse as the french cook in the play defines a tigre these mysterious personages rejoice in the title of doctor nce a very distinctive appellation but now as common as authorship and travelling a moralist watching them gliding by amid fashionable equipages crowded omnibuses hasty pedestrians and all the phenomena of life in a metropolis would find a striking contrast between the rushing tide around and the hushed rooms they enter to how many their visit is the one daily event that breaks in upon the monotony of illness and confinement how many eyes watch them with eager suspense and listen to their opinion as the fiat of destiny how many feverishly expect their coming shrink from their polished steel rejoice in their cheering ministrations or dread their long bills he doctor word that stirs the extremest moods despair and jollity there is no profession which depends so much for its efficiency on personal traits as that of medicine for the utility of technical knowledge here is derived from individual judgment tact and sympathy in other words the physician has to deal with an unknown element between the specific ailment and the remedy there are peculiarities of constitution the influence of circumstances and the laws of nature to be considered so that although the medical adviser may be thoroughly versed in physiology the materia medica and the symptoms of disease if he possess not the discrimination the observant skill and the reflective power to apply his learning wisely it is comparatively unavailing the aim of the divine and the attorney however impeded by obstacles is reached by a more direct course logic eloquence and zeal united to professional attainment will insure success in law and divinity but in physic certain other qualities in the man are requisite to give scope to the professor hence we associate a certain originality with the idea of a doctor are apt to regard the vocation at the two extremes of superiority and pretension and justly estimate the individuals of the class according to their capacity of insight and their principles of action rather than by their mere acquisitions or rank as teachers the uncertainty of medicine as a practical art thus induces a stronger reliance on individual endowments than is the case in any other liberal pursuit a philosophical history of the art of healing would be not less curious than suggestive the absurd theories which checked its progress for centuries the secrets hoarded by egyptian priests the union of medical knowledge with ancient systems of philosophy the epoch of galen the arabian and salerno schools the reformation of paracelsus the brilliant discoveries which at long

is now acknowledged that diverse climates require modified treatment of the same disease that nervous susceptibility is far greater in one latitude than another and that habits of life essentially individualize the constitution indeed the widest difference exists in the relation of persons to the doctor some never see him and others must have a consultation upon the most trifling ailment o great is the dependence which can be had upon nature and so extreme both the faith and the scepticism which exist in regard to curative science popular literature is full of hits at the profession e barbier fait plus de la moiti un decin says moli re who in la malade imaginaire has so acutely given the current philosophy of the subject by satirizing the pedantry and charlatanism of the doctors of

of heaven complains sancho panza ther doctors kill their patients and are paid for it too and yet they are at no further trouble than scrawling two or three cramp words for some physical sliplop which the apothecaries are at all the pains to make up it would seem indeed as if the advance of science improved medical practice negatively hat is by inducing what in politics has been called a masterly inactivity and there is no doubt that no small degree of the success attending hahnemann theory is to be attributed to the comparative abstinence it inculcates in the use of remedial agents the fact is a significant one as indicative of the want of positive science in the healing art and the consequent wisdom of leaving to nature as far as possible the restorative process indeed to assist nature is acknowledged by just observers to be the only wise course and this brings us to the inference that a good physician is necessarily a philosopher it is incumbent on him of all men to exercise the inductive faculty he must possess good causality not only to reason justly on individual cases but to apply the progress of science to the exigencies of disease it is related of bixio that such was his zeal for science having long wished to ascertain whether a man instinctively turns when wounded in a vital part asked his adversary in a duel to aim at one and although fatally hurt exclaimed with ardour as he involuntarily spun round t is true they do turn the comparatively slow accumulation of scientific truth in regard to the treatment of disease is illustrated by the fact that not until the lapse of two thousand years after medicine had assumed the rank of a science under the auspices of hippocrates was the circulation of the blood discovered n era in its history the fiery discussion of the efficacy of inoculation and its gradual introduction is another significant evidence of the same general truth but in our own day the rapid and valuable developments of chemistry have in a measure reversed the picture numerous alleviating and curative agents have been discovered the gas of poisonous acids is found to eradicate in many cases the most fatal diseases of the eye heat more penetrating than can be created by other means is eliminated from carbon in an a riform state passes through the cuticle without leaving a mark on its surface and restores aching nerves or exhausted vitality vegetable and mineral substances are refined analyzed and combined with a skill never before imagined opium yields morphine and peruvian bark quinine and all the known salubrious elements are thus rendered infinitely subservient to the healing art chloroform is one of the most beneficent of these new agents and has exorcised the demon of physical pain by a magical charm without violating in judicious hands the integrity of nature there is a secret of curative art in which consists the genius of healing it is that union of sympathy with intelligence and of moral energy with magnetic gifts whereby the tides of life are swayed and one an minister to a mind diseased fortunate is the patient who is attended by one thus endowed but such are usually found out of the professional circle

could be derived from books one of his opponents from this confession infers the fallacy of his system he conviction he observes s irresistibly forced upon us that he was not a born physician if our ancestors were less enlightened in regard to hygi ne and if their physicians were less scrupulous in tampering with the functions of nature they had one signal advantage over us in escaping the inhuman comments made after every fatal issue on the practice and the treatment adopted o matter with how much conscientious intelligence we not only suffer the pangs of bereavement but the reproaches of devotees of each school of medicine and of rival doctors of having by an unwise choice sacrificed the life for which we would have cheerfully resigned our own somewhat of this occult healing force might have been read in the serene countenance of dr physic of philadelphia it predominated in the benevolent founder of the insane asylum of palermo who learned from an attack of mental disorder how to feel for and minister to those thus afflicted the late preissnitz of graefenberg seems to have enjoyed the gift which is as truly nature indication of an aptitude for the art as a sense of beauty in the poet but this principle is aviare to the general medicine has lost much of its inherent dignity by the same element in modern times that has degraded art letters and society he spirit of trade this agency encourages motives justifies means and leads to ends wholly at variance with high tone and with truth the gentleman the philosopher the man of honour and with them that keystone in the arch of character elfespect are wholly compromised in the process of sinking a liberal art into a common trade in the economy of modern society however the physician has acquired a new influence he has gained upon the monopoly of the priest for while the spirit of inquiry by trenching on the mysterious prerogatives which superstition once accorded has retrenched the latter functions the same agency by extending the domain of science and rendering its claims popular has enlarged the sphere of the other profession to an extent therefore never before known the doctor fills the office of confessor his visits yield agreeable excitement to women with whom he gossips and sympathizes admitted by the very exigency of the case to entire confidence often revered as a counsellor and friend as well as relied on as a healer not infrequently he becomes the oracle of a household privileges like these when used with benevolence and integrity are doubtless honourable to both parties and become occasions for the exercise of the noblest service and the highest sentiments of our nature while on the other hand they are liable to the grossest abuse where elevation of character and gentlemanly instincts are wanting accordingly there has sprung into existence in our day a personage best designated as the medical jesuit whose real vocation as well as the process by which he acquires supremacy fully justifies the appellation like his religious prototype he operates through the female branches who in their turn control the heads of families and the extent to which the domestic arrangements the social relations and even the opinions of individuals are thus regulated is truly surprising omen says mrs jameson re inclined to fall in love with priests and physicians because of the help and comfort they derive from both in perilous moral and physical maladies they believe in the presence of real pity real sympathy where the look and tone of each have become merely habitual and conventional i may say professional yet a popular novelist in his ideal portrait of the physician justly claims superiority to impulse and casual sympathy as an essential requisite to success e must enter the room a calm intelligencer he is disabled for his mission if he suffer aught to obscure the keen glance of his science the natural history of the doctor has not yet been written but the classes are easily nomenclated we have all known the humorous the urbane the oracular the facetious the brusque the elegant the shrewd the exquisite the burly the bold and the fastidious and the character of people may be inferred by their choice of each species those in whom taste predominates over intellect will select a physician for his agreeable personal qualities while such as value essential traits will compromise with the roughest exterior and the least flattering address for the sake of genuine skill and a vigorous and honest mind as a general rule in large cities vanity seems to rule the selection and it is a lamentable view of human nature to see the blind preference given to plausible but shallow men whose smooth tongues or gallant air win them suffrages denied to good sense and candid intercourse the most detestable genus is that we have described under the name of medical jesuits next in annoyance are the precisians the most harmless of the weaker order are the gossips and there is often little to choose in point of risk to he house of life between the very timid and the dareevils in a great exigency the former and in an ordinary case the latter are equally

genius is not there such a special therapeutic gift had hippocrates sydenham pott purcell john hunter delpech dupuytren kellie cheyne baillie and abercrombie moreover let me tell you my young doctor

despised brillat savarin declares doctors easily become gourmands because so well received in paris edinburgh and philadelphia all the world over the medical student is an exceptional character their pranks are patent the rough ones like to kick up rows and the more quiet are unique at practical jokes bob sawyer is a typical hero if like the portraitainter doctors are often the playthings of fortune in cities where the arbitrary whims of fashion decree success in the country their true worth is more apt to find appreciation and the individualities of character having free scope quite original children of apollo are the result the name of hopkins is still memorable in the region where he practised as one of the literary clique of which humphries dwight and barlow were members dr osborn of sandwich mass wrote the popular whalingong yet in vogue among nantucketers dr holyoke of salem is renowned as a beautiful instance of longevity and the wit of dr spring was proverbial in boston the best example of a medical philosopher in our annals is that of dr rush of philadelphia he reformed the system of practice first treated yellow fever successfully made climate a special study and like burke laid every one he encountered under contribution for facts his life of seventy years was passed in ardent investigation it is remarkable that the first martyr to american liberty was a physician and before he fell warren eloquently avowed his principles like k rner in germany rousing the spirit of his countrymen and then consecrating his sentiments with his blood boylston the ancestral portraits of whose family are among the best of copley american works nearly fell a victim to public indignation for his zealous and intelligent advocacy of inoculation and natural science

helped to elevate catharine to the russian throne haller was a poet and romancer cuvier was the greatest naturalist of his age and murat was a doctor french decins have figured in the chamber and on the boulevards if by virtue of the philosophic instinct and liberal tastes the doctor is thus allied to bellesettres he is allured into the domain of science by a still more direct sympathy to how many has the study of the materia medica and the culling of simples proved the occasion of botanical research and hence by an easy transition of exploring the entire field of natural science thus davy was beguiled into chemical investigation and abercrombie by the vestibule of physiological knowledge sought the clue to mental philosophy while spurzheim and combe ministered to a great charity by clearly explaining to the masses the natural laws of human welleing it is an evidence of the sagacity of the russian peter that he sought an interview with boerha ve for by these varied links of

his interviews with those two illustrious patients irabeau and condorcet the social affinities of the doctor prove indirectly what we before suggested that it is in the character more than in the learning in the mind rather than the technical knowledge that medical success lies one of the shrewdest of the profession abernethy declared thereof have observed in my profession that the greatest

cruel instrumental obstetrician s the type of an almost obsolete class as the doctor in macbeth is of the sapient pretender of all time as to ideal doctors how real to our minds is that wordsworthean myth dr fell the physician of sancho panza and the purgon of moli re while dulcamara is a permanent type of the clever quack dr bartolo of the solemn professor and sangrado of the merciless phlebotomist to think it ore honourable to fail according to rule than to succeed by innovation is a satire of no local significance but the constant creed of the medical pedant satirized years ago by the french comic dramatist the profession was caricatured the other day by a young disciple of esculapius who in a clever drawing represented the votary of homoeopathy with a little globule between thumb and finger engaged in a kind of airy swallowing the allopathic patient in an easyhair is making wry faces over a large spoonful of physic the believer in hydropathy sits forlorn and shivering in

transport of infernal joy southey took a wise advantage of the popular idea of a doctor in the genial and speculative phase of the character when he gave the title to his last rambling erudite quaint and charming production men of letters accordingly are wont to fraternize with the best of the profession and there has always been a reciprocal interchange between them both of affection and wit thus halleck tells us in fanny n physic we have francis and meven famed for long heads short lectures and long bills and quackenboss and others who from heaven were rained upon us in a shower of pills they beat the deathless esculapius hollow and make a starveling druggist of apollo the record of our surgeons in the war for the union is alike honourable to their patriotism humanity and skill popular writers have indicated the claims and character of the profession not only in a dramatic or anecdotal way but by personal testimony and observation and those who have had the best opportunities and are endowed with liberal sympathies warmly recognize the possible usefulness and probable benevolence of a class of men more often satirized than sung the privations and toil incident to country practice half a century ago are scarcely imagined now sir walter scott tells us have heard the celebrated traveller mungo park who had experienced both courses of life rather give the preference to travelling as a discoverer in africa than to wandering by night and day the wilds of his native land in the capacity of a country practitioner dr johnson a livelong invalid and not apt to overlook professional foibles gives a high average character to the doctor hether he observes hat sir william temple says be true that the physicians have more learning than the other faculties i will not stay to inquire but i believe every man has found in physicians great liberality and dignity of sentiment very prompt effusion of beneficence and willingness to exert a lucrative art where there is no hope of lucre it is a nervous process to undergo the examination of a parisian medical professor of the first class auscultation was first introduced by one of them laennec and diagnosis is their chief art in their hands the stethoscope is a diviningod so reliable is their insight that they seem to read the internal organism as through a glass and one feels under louis inspection as if awaiting sentence the laws of disease have been thoroughly studied in the hospitals of paris and the philosophy of symptoms is there understood by the medical savans with the certainty of a natural science but the knowledge and application of remedies is by no means advanced in equal proportion accordingly the perfection of modern skill in the art seems to result from an education in the french schools combined with experience in english practice thorough acquaintance with physiology and habits of acute observation and accurate deduction are thus united to executive tact and ability and similar eclectic traits of character are desirable in the physician especially the union of solidity of mind with agreeableness of manner for in no vocation is there so often demanded the blending of the fortiter in re with the suaviter in modo the absence of faith in positive remedies that obtains in europe is very striking to an american visitor because it offers so absolute a contrast to the system pursued at home i attended the funeral of a countryman a few days after reaching paris and on our way to p re la chaise his case and treatment were fully discussed his disease was typhus fever previous to delirium he had designated a physician a celebrated professor who only prescribed gomme syrop for a week i travelled with a dominican friar who had so high a fever that in america he would have been confined to his bed he took no nourishment all the time but a plate of thin soup once a day and when we reached our destination he was convalescent abstinence and repose are appreciated on the continent as remedial agencies but they are contrary to the genius of our people who regard active enterprise as no less desirable in a doctor than a steamboat captain veteran practitioners have demonstrated that certain diseases are selfimited that the art of treating diseases is still conjectural study and avowed the conviction that he amount of death and disaster in the world would be less if all disease were left to itself than it now is under the multiform reckless and contradictory modes of practice a conscientious student of high personal character entered upon the profession with enthusiastic faith experience in the use of remedies made him sceptical and he resorted to evasion by giving water only under various pretexts and names his success was so much greater than that of his brethren that he felt bound to reveal the ruse but continued thenceforth to assert that all things being equal more patients would survive if properly guarded and nourished without medicine than with the influence of the mind upon the body is in some instances so great that it accounts for that identity of superstition and medicine which is one of the most remarkable traits in the history of the science sir walter raleigh cordial was as famous in its day as mrs trulbery water praised by sir roger de coverley in egypt old practitioners cure with amulets and charms among the tartars they swallow the name of the remedy with perfect faith and from the puritan horseshoe to keep off witchcraft to perkins tractors to annihilate rheumatism the history of medical delusions is rife with imaginary triumphs as late as the seventeenth century when arabian precepts and the jewish leech of chivalric times had disappeared when the square cap and falling beards had given place to the wig and cane in some places the mystic emblems of skull stuffed lizards pickled fetus and alembic gave a necromantic air to the doctor sanctum the unknown is the source of the marvellous and the relation between a disease and its cure is less obvious to the common understanding than that between the evidence and the verdict in a law case or religious faith and its public ministration in the office of priest the imagination has room to act and the sense of wonder is naturally excited when by the agency of some drug mechanical apparatus or mystic rite it is attempted to relieve human suffering and dispel infirmity hence the most enlightened minds are apt to yield to credulity in this sphere much to the annoyance of the egular faculty who complain with reason that quackery whether in the form of popular specifics or the person of a charlatan derives its main support from men of civic and professional reputation think of dr johnson in his infancy being touched for king evil by queen anne in accordance with a belief in its sovereign efficiency unquestioned for centuries sir kenelm digby was as much celebrated in his day for his recipe for a sympathetic powder which he obtained from an italian friar as for his beautiful wife or his naval victory and the good bishop berkeley gave as much zeal to the treatise on the virtues of tarater as to that on the immateriality of the universe shakspeare has drawn a quack doctor to the life in caius the french physician in the merry wives of windsor and uttered an impressive protest against the tribe in all well that ends well king but may not be so credulous of cure when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidable estate i say we must not so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope to prostitute our pasture malady to empirics or to dissever so our great self and our credit to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem an american

of dried orangeeel when dr spurzheim was first visited by the physicians in his last illness he told them to allow for the habitual irregularity of his pulse which had intermitted ever since the death of his wife george combe used to tell a capital story in his lectures of the manner in which a pious scotch lady made her grandson pass sunday whereby while outwardly keeping the sabbath he violated all the rules of health two of the most characteristic books in british literature are greene poem of the spleen and dr cheyne english malady and another is the history of the goldeaded cane or rather of the five doctors that successively owned it the cane indeed was ever an indispensable symbol of medical authority the story of dr radcliffe illustrates its modern significance but the association of the walkingtaff and the doctor comes down to us from medi val times e smelt his cane in the old ballads is a phrase suggestive of a then common expedient the head of the physician cane was filled with disinfectant herbs the odour of which the owner inhaled when exposed to miasma even at this day in some of the provincial towns in italy we encounter the doctor in the pharmacist shop awaiting patients is dress and manner such as are reproduced in the comic drama while the quack of the piazza is recognized on the operatic stage how unprofessional medicine is becoming may be seen in current literature when de quincey metaphysical account of the effects of opium and bulwer fascinating plea for the waterure are ranked as light reading to the lover of the old english proseriters there is no more endeared name than sir thomas browne and his religio medici and quaint tracts are among the choicest gifts for which philosophy is indebted to the profession while the classical student owes to dr middleton a life of cicero the vivacious lady montagu is most gratefully remembered for her philanthropic efforts in behalf of inoculation for smallpox and our brockden brown has described the phenomena of an epidemic in one of his novels with more insight though less horror than defoe it is in pestilence and after battle that the doctor sometimes rises to the moral sublime in his disinterested and unwearied devotion to others it must however be confessed that notwithstanding these incidental laurels the authority of the profession has so declined the malades imaginaires so increased with civilization and the privileges of the faculty been so encroached upon by what is called rogress that a doctor of the old school would scorn to tolerate the fallen dignity of a title that once rendered his intercourse with society oracular and authorized him with impunity to whip a king as in the case of dr willis and george the third he philosophy of medicine i imagine observed dr arnold s zero our practice is empirical and seems hardly more than a course of guessing more or less happy none have been more sceptical than physicians themselves in regard to their own science broussais calls it illusory like astrology and bichat declares t is in respect to its principles taken from most of our materia medicas impracticable for a sensible man an incoherent assemblage of incoherent opinions it is perhaps of all the physiological sciences the one which shows plainest the contradictions and wanderings of the human mind montaigne used to beseech his friends that if he fell ill they would let him get a little stronger before sending for the doctor louis who was a slave to his physicians asked moli re what he did for his doctor h sire said he hen i am ill i send for him he comes we have a chat and enjoy ourselves he prescribes i don take it nd i am cured here is a certain analogy says an agreeable writer etween naval and medical men neither like to acknowledge the presence of danger on the other hand each patient character as well as constitution makes a separate demand upon his sympathy for in cases where fortitude and intelligence exist perfect frankness is due and in instances of extreme sensibility it may prove fatal so that the most delicate consideration is often required to decide on the expediency of enlightening the invalid if it is folly to theorize in medicine it is often sinful to flatter the imagination for the purpose of securing temporary ease a physician course like that of men in all pursuits is sometimes regulated by his consciousness and he is apt to prescribe according to his own rather than his patient nature thus a fleshy doctor is inclined to bleed and recommend generous diet a nervous one affects mild anodynes a vain one talks science and a thin coldlooded speculative one makes safe experiments in practice and is habitually nonommittal in speech almost invariably shortecked plethoric doctors enjoy freeing the vessels of others by copious depletion and those more delicately organized advocate fresh air and tonics the one instinctively reasoning from the surplus and the other from the inadequate vitality of which they are respectively conscious i knew a doctor who scarcely ever failed to prescribe an emetic and the expression of his countenance indicated chronic nausea medicine enjoys no immunity from the spirit of the age who does not recognize in the popularity of hahnemann system the influence of the transcendental philosophy a kind of intuitive practice analogous to the vague terms of its disciples in literature those little globules with the theoretical accompaniment catch the fancy castoril and the lancet are matterfact in comparison and so with hydropathy there is in our day what

an elemental medicament limpid as the style of peter bell free from admixture as the individual labour in a model community and as directly caught from nature as the a rial perspective of england late scenic limner even what has been considered the inevitable resort to dissection in order to acquire anatomical knowledge it is now pretended has a substitute in clairvoyance somewhat of truth in this spiritualizing tendency of science there doubtless is but fact is the basis of positive knowledge and the most unwarrantable of all experiments are those involving human health if the mental experience of a doctor naturally leads to philosophy the moral tends to make him a philanthropist he is familiar with all the ills that flesh is heir to the mystery of birth the solemnity of death the anxiety of disease the devotion of faith the agony of despair are phases of life daily open to his view and their contemplation if there is in his nature a particle either of reflection or sensibility must lead to a sense of human brotherhood excite the impulse of benevolence and awaken the spirit of humanity warren diary of a physician gives us an inkling of what varieties of human experience are exposed to his gaze vigils at the couch of genius and beauty full of the stern romance of reality or imbued with tenderness and inspiration are recorded in his heart he is admitted into sanctums where no other feet but those of kindred enter he becomes the inevitable auditor and spectator where no other stranger looks or listens human nature stripped of its conventionalities lies exposed before him the secrets of conscience the aspirations of intellect the devotedness of love all that exalts and all that debases the soul he beholds in the hour of weakness solitude or dismay and hard and unthinking must he be if such lessons make no enduring impression and excite no comprehensive sympathies he cornertone of health says a german writer s to maintain our individuality intact and while

here i must have leave in the fulness of my soul to regret the abolition and doing away with altogether of those consolatory interstices and sprinklings of freedom through the four seasons he redetter days now become to all intents and purposes deadetter days harles lamb while we accord a certain historical or ethical significance to our holidays we also feel their casual tenure their want of recreative rest of enjoyable spirit and of cordial popular estimation and are irresistibly prompted to discuss their claims as one of the neglected elements of our national life it is an anomalous fact in our civilization that we have no one holiday the observance of which is unanimous it is an exceptional trait in our nationality that its sentiment finds no annual occasion when the hearts of the people thrill with an identical emotion absorbing in patriotic instinct and mutual reminiscence all personal interests and local prejudices it is an unfortunate circumstance that no american festival absolutely consecrated and universally acknowledged hallows the calendar to the imagination of our people anniversaries enough we boast of historical importance but they are casually observed events of glorious memory crowd our brief annals but they are not consciously identified with recurring periods universal celebrities are included in the roll of our country benefactors but the dates of their birth services and decease form no saints days for the republic how often in the crises of sectional passion does the moral necessity of a common shrine a national feast a place a time or a memory sacred to fraternal sympathies of general observance appal the patriotic heart with regret or warm it with desire how much of sectional misunderstanding hatred and barbarism culminating in a base and savage mutiny will the future historian trace in the last analysis to the absence of a common sentiment and occasion of mutual pleasure and faith were such a nucleus for popular enthusiasm such a goal for a nation pilgrimage such a day for reciprocal gratulation our own time when the oath of fealty could be renewed at the same altar the voice of encouragement be echoed from every section of the union the memory of what has been the appreciation of what is and the hope of what may be simultaneously felt hat a bond of union a motive to forbearance and a pledge of nationality would be secured were there not in us sentiments as well as appetites reflection as well as passion humanity might rest content with such ote of time as is marked on a sunial or in the almanac but constituted as we are a profound and universal instinct prompts observances wherewith faith hope and memory may keep register of the fleeting hours and months in accordance with this instinct periodical sacrifice song prayer and banquet in all countries and ages have inscribed with heartfelt ceremony the shadowy lapse of being without law or art the savage thus identifies his consciousness with the seasons and their transition anniversaries typifying vicissitude the wheel of custom stops awhile events convictions reminiscences and aspirations are personified in the calendar and that reason which before and after asserts itself under every guise from the barbarian rite to the christian festival and begets the holiday as an institution natural to man if the ballads of a people are the essence of its history holidays are on similar grounds the free utterance of its character and as such of great interest to the philosopher and fraught with endearing associations to the philanthropist the spontaneous in nations as well as individuals is attractive to the eye of philosophy because it is eminently characteristic the great charm of biography is its revelation of the play of mind and the aspect of character when freed from conventional restraints and in the life of nations how inadequate are the records of diplomacy legislation and war he official and economical development o indicate what is instinctive and typical in character it is when the armour of daily toil the insignia of office the prosaic routine of life are laid aside that what is peculiar in form and graceful in movement become evident in the glee or solemnity of the festival the soul breaks forth in the fusion of a common idea the heart of a country becomes freely manifest accordingly the manner the spirit and the object of festal observances are among the most significant illustrations of history an accurate chart of these from the earliest time would afford a reliable index to the progress of humanity and suggest a remarkable identity of natural wants tendencies and aspirations there is for instance a singular affinity between the saturnalia of the ancient and the carnival of the modern romans the sports of the ancient circus and bullights of spain while so closely parallel in some respects are druidical and monastic vows and fanaticism that one of the most popular of modern italian operas which revived the picturesque costume and sylvan rites of the druids was threatened with prohibition as a satire upon the church it would indeed well repay antiquarian investigation to trace the germ of holiday customs from the crude superstitions of barbarians through the usages incident to a more refined mythology to their modified reappearance in the catholic temples where pagan rites are invested with christian meaning or the statue of jupiter transformed into st peter and the sarcophagus of a heathen becomes the font of holy baptism gibbon tells us how shrewd pope boniface professed but to rehabilitate old customs when he revived the secular games in rome not only are traces of pagan forms discoverable in the modern holidays but the medi val taste for exhibitions of animal courage and vigour still lives in the love of prizeights and horseacing so prevalent in england and the ring and the cockpit minister to the same brutal passions which of old filled the flavian amphitheatre with eager spectators and gave a relish to the ordeal of blood in the abuses of the modern pastime we behold the relics of barbarism and the perpetuity of such national tastes is evident in the combative instinct which once sustained the orders of chivalry and in our day has lured thousands to the destructive battleields of the crimea and virginia not only do the social organizations devoted to popular amusements and economies thus give the best tokens of local manners and average taste but they directly minister to the culture they illustrate the gladiator utchered to make a roman holiday nurtured with his lifeblood and dying agonies the ferocious propensities and military hardihood of the imperial cohorts the graceful posture and fine muscular display of the wrestler and discuslayer of athens reappeared in the statues which peopled her squares and temples the equine beauty and swiftness exhibited at derby and ascot keep alive the emulation which renders england famous for breeds of horses and her gentry healthful by equestrian exercise the custom of musical accompaniments at every german symposium has in a great measure bred a nation of vocal and instrumental performers the dance became a versatile art in france because it was as it still is the national pastime the circassian is expert with steed and rifle from the habit of dexterity acquired in the festive trials of skill excellence in which is the qualification for leadership the compass flexibility and sweetness of the human voice so characteristic of the people of italy have been attained through ages of vocal practice in ecclesiastical and rural festivals and the copious melody of their language gradually arose through the canzoni of troubadours and the rhythmical feats of improvisatori the deafening clang of gongs the blinding smoke of chowsticks and the dazzling light of innumerable lanterns wherewith the chinese celebrate their national feasts are to european senses the most oppressive imaginable token of a stagnant and primitive civilization the festive elements of the semiarbarism artistically represented by their grotesque figures ignorance of perspective interminable alphabet pinched feet bare scalps and implacable hatred of innovation both in the processes and the forms of advanced taste even the aboriginal feasts of this continent were the best indication of what the american indians in their palmy days could boast of strength agility and grace thus from the most cultivated to the least developed races what is adopted and expressed in a recreative or holiday manner hat is thus done and said sought and felt he rallyingoint of popular sympathy the occasion of the universal joy or reverence s a moral fact of unique and permanent interest on the one hand as illustrative of the kind and degree of civilization attained and of the instinctive direction of the national mind and on the other as indicative of the means and the processes whereby the wants are met and the ideas realized which stimulate and mould a nation genius and faith the testimony of observation accords with that of history in this regard the foreign scenes which haunt the memory as popular illustrations of character are those of holidays the government literature art and society of a country may be individually represented to our minds but when we discuss national traits we instinctively refer to the pastimes the religious ceremonials and the festivals of a people where has the pugilistic hilarity of the irish scope as at donnybrook fair is a dull parliamentary speech or an animated debate at the racecourse most vivid with the spirit of english life marketay and harvestome and saintly anniversaries evoke from its commonplace level the life of the humble and the princely and they appear before the stranger under a genuine and characteristic guise we associate the french as a people with the rustic groups under the trees of montmorency or the crowds of neatlyressed and gay bourgeoise at the jardin diver inding in the green grass lights cheap wine and comfits a flower in the hair a waltz and saunter more real pleasure than a less frugal and mercurial people can extract from a solemn feast garnished with extravagant upholstery and loaded with luxurious viands we recall the italians and spaniards by the ceaseless bells of their festas vibrating in the air and the golden necklace and graceful mezzano of the peasant holiday the tinkle of guitars the bolero and processions or the lines of stars marking the architecture of illuminated temples the euphonious greeting the lightearted carol the abundant fruit the knots of flowers the gay jerkin and bodice which render the urbane throng so picturesque in aspect and childlike in enjoyment the sadness which overhung the very idea of italy considered as a political entity exhaled like magic before the spectacle of a tuscan vintage the heaps of purple and amber fruit the gray and pensiveyed oxen the reeking butts the yellow vineeaves waving in the autumn sun form studies for the pencil but the human interest of the scene infinitely endears its still life kindred and friends in festal array celebrate their work and rejoice over the falernian lachryma christi or vino nostrale with a frank and na ve gratitude akin to the mellow smile of productive nature the distance between the lord of the soil and the peasant is for the time lost in a mutual and innocent triumph they who are wont to serve become guests the dance and song the compliment and repartee the toast and the smile are interchanged on the one side with artless loyalty and on the other with a condescension merged in graciousness it seems as if the hand of nature in yielding her annual tribute literally imparted to prince and peasant the touch which makes he whole world kin the contrast in respect of pastime is felt most keenly when we observe life at home with the impressions of the old world fresh in our minds we have perhaps joined the laughing group who cluster round punch and judy on the mole of naples we have watched the flitting emotions on swarthy listeners who greedily drink in the storyeller words on the shore of palermo we have made an old gondolier chant a stanza of tasso at sunset on the adriatic our hostess at florence has decked the window with a consecrated branch on palm sunday we have seen the poor contadini of a roman village sport their silver knobs and hang out their one bit of crimson tapestry in honour of some local saint we have examined the last mosaic saint exhumed from pompeii brilliant with festal rites and thus as an element both of history and experience of religion and domesticity the recreative side of life appears essential and absolute while the hurrying crowd hasty salutations and absorption in affairs around us seem to repudiate and ignore the inference and to confirm the opinion of one whose existence was divided between this country and europe that he americans are practical stoics to appreciate the value of holidays merely as a conservative element of faith we have but to remember the jewish festivals ages of dispersion isolation contempt and persecution that mortal agencies can effect to chill the zeal or to discredit the traditions of the hebrews ave not in the slightest degree lessened the sanction or diminished the observance of that festival to keep which the divine founder of our religion nineteen centuries ago went up to jerusalem with his disciples and it is difficult to conceive a more sublime idea than is involved in this fact on the day of the passover in the austrian banker splendid palace in the miserable ghetto of rome under the shadow of syrian mosques in the wretched byay hostel of poland at the foot of egyptian pyramids beside the holy sepulchre among the moneyhangers of paris and the pawnbrokers of london along the canals of holland in siberia denmark calcutta and new york in every nook of the civilized world the jew celebrates his holy national feast and who can estimate how much this and similar rites have to do with the eternal marvel of that nation survival the conservatism inherent in traditional festivals not only binds together and keeps intact the scattered communities of a dispersed race but saves from extinction many local and inherited characteristics i was never so impressed with this thought as on the occasion of an annual village f te in sicily perhaps no territory of the same limits comprehends such a variety of elements in the basis of its existent population as that luxuriant and beautiful but illated island its surface is venerable with the architectural remains of successive races here a grecian temple there a saracenic dome now a roman fortification again a norman tower and often a medi val ruin of some incongruous order attracts the traveller gaze from broad valleys rich with grain oliverchards and citronroves vineyards planted in decomposed lava hedges of aloe meadows of wildlowers a torrent arid path a hollyrowned mountain a cork forest or seaward landscape but the more flexible materials left by the receding tide of invasion are so blended in the physiognomies the customs and the patois of the inhabitants that only nice investigation can trace them amid the generic phenomena of nationality now recognized as sicilian yet the people of a village but a few miles from the capital have so identified their greek origin with the costume of a holiday that as one scans their festal array it is easy to imagine that the unmixed blood of their classic progenitors flushes in the dark eyes and mantles in the olive cheeks this ancestral dress is the endeared heirloom in the homes of the peasantry assumed with conscious pride and gaiety to meet the wondering eyes of neighbouring contadini curious palermitans and delighted strangers who flock to the spectacle the love of power is a great teacher of human instincts and despotism both civil and spiritual has in all ages availed itself of the natural instinct for festivals to multiply and enhance shows amusements and holidays in a manner which yields profitable lessons to free communities intent on adapting the same means to nobler ends the stated pilgrimage to the tomb of the prophet is an important part of the superstitious machinery of the mohammedan tyranny over the will and conscience and it is difficult to conceive now to what an extent the zeal and unity of the early christians were enforced by specific days of ceremonial and by such a hallowed goal as jerusalem imperial authority in france is upheld by festive seductions adapted to a vivacious populace and by masque balls municipal banquets showers of bonons and ascent of balloons contrives to win attention from republican discontent mercenary rulers of petty states by the gift of stars and red ribbons and liberal contributions to the opera obtain an economical safeguard the policy of the romish church is nowhere more striking than in her holiday institutions appealing to native sentiment through pageantry music and impressive rites in honour of saints martyrs and departed friends to propitiate their intercession or to endear their memories while the pastimes in vogue typify the national mind and are to serious avocations what the efflorescence of the tree is to its fruit bountiful pledge and augury of prolific energy t is only when kept as holidays set apart by law and usage consecrated by time and sympathy that such observances attain their legitimate meaning and to this end a certain affinity with character a spontaneous and not conventional impulse is essential the tournament for instance was the natural and appropriate pastime of the age of chivalry it fostered knightly prowess and made patent the twinborn inspiration of love and valour as described in ivanhoe it accords intimately with the spirit of the age and the history of the times as exhibited to the utilitarian vision and mercantile habits of our own day in virginia it comes no nearer our associations than any theatrical pageant chosen at hapazard what other species of grown men could in this age enact every year in the neighbourhood of rome the scenes which make the artists holiday as a profession they retain the instincts of childhood with little warping from the world around but imagine a set of mechanics or merchants attempting such a masquerade the invention the fancy the independence and the abandon congenial with artistife gives unity picturesqueness and grace to the pageant and the speeches costumes feasting and drollery are preminently those of an artist carnival it is indispensable that the spirit of a holiday should be native to the scene and the people and hence all endeavours to graft local pastimes upon foreign communities signally fail this is illustrated in our immediate vicinity the genial fellowship and exuberant hospitality with which the first day of the year is celebrated in new york were characteristic among the dutch colonists and have been transmitted to their posterity while the tone of new england society though more intellectual is less urbane and companionable accordingly the few enthusiasts who have attempted it have been unable either by precept or example to make a boston new year day the complete and hearty festival which renders it par excellence the holiday of the knickerbockers charitable enterprise for several years past in the puritan city has distinguished mayay as a children floral anniversary but who that is familiar with the peasantongs that hail this advent of summer in the south of europe ever beheld the shivering infants and the wilted leaves paraded in the teeth of an east wind without a conscious recoil from the anomalous f te the facts of habit public sentiment natural taste local association and of climate cannot be ignored in holiday institutions which like eloquence as defined by webster must spring directly from the men the subject and the occasion any other source is unstable and factitious of all affectations those of diversion are the least endurable and there is no phase of social life more open to satire nor any that has provoked it to more legitimate purpose than the affectation of a taste for art sporting the balloom the bivouac the gymnasium foreign travel country life nautical adventure and literary amusements an affectation yielding as we know food for the most spicy irony from goldoni filosofo inglese to hood cockney ruralist and punch amateur sportsman or verdant tourist and what is true of personal incongruities is only the more conspicuous in social and national life when our literary pioneer sought to waken the fraternal sentiment of his countrymen towards their ancestral land he described with sympathetic zest an english christmas in an old family mansion and the most popular of modern novelists can find no more potent spell whereby to excite a charitable glow in two hemispheres than a christmas carol in new as well as in old england the once absolute sway of this greatest of christian festivals has been checked by puritan zeal we must look to the ancient ballads obsolete plays and musty church traditions to ascertain what this hallowed season was in the british islands when wassail and the yuleog largess and the lord of misrule the mistletoe bough boars heads holly wreaths midnight chimes the feast of kindred the anthem the prayer the games of children the good cheer of the poor forgiveness gratulation worship that revelry hails and religion consecrates ade holiday in palace manor and cottage throughout the land winter robe of ermine everywhere vividly contrasting with evergreen decorations the frosty air with the warmth of household fires the cold sky with the incense of hospitable hearths when king charles acted ben jonson wrote a masque milton a hymn lords and peasants flocked to the altar parents and children gathered round the board and church home wayside town and country bore witness to one mingled and hearty sentiment of festivity identical in season with the roman saturnalia and the time when the scalds let ildly loose their red locks fly christmas is sanctioned by all that is venerable in association as well as tender and joyous in faith it is deeply to be regretted that with us its observance is almost exclusively confined to the romanists and episcopalians the sentiment of all christian denominations is equally identified with its commemoration the event it celebrates being essentially memorable alike to all who profess christianity and although the forlorn description by pepys of a puritan christmas will not apply to the occasion here its comparative neglect which followed bloody mary reign continues among too many of the sects that found refuge in america there are abundant indications that if the clergy would initiate the movement the laity are prepared to make christmas among us the universal religious holiday which every consideration of piety domestic affection and traditional reverence unite to proclaim it the humanities of time if we may so designate the periods consecrated to repose and festivity were thoroughly appreciated by the most quaint and genial of english essayists the boon of leisure the amenities of social intercourse the sacredness and the humours of oldashioned holidays have found their most loving interpreter in our day in charles lamb hear him must have leave in the fulness of my soul to regret the abolition and doing away with altogether of those consolatory interstices and sprinklings of freedom through the four seasons he redetter days now become to all

charity boy bjectless holiday of the ost touching peal which rings out the old year of he safety which a palpable hallucination warrants on all fools and the goetween st valentine the devotion to the immediate the thrift the enterprise and the material activity which pertain to a new country and especially to our own distinguish american holidays from those of the old world not a few of them are consecrated to the future many spring from the triumphs of the present and nearly all hint progress rather than retrospection we inaugurate civil and local improvements glorify the achievements of mechanical skill and of social reform pay honour by feasts processions and rhetoric to public men give a municipal ovation to a foreign patriot or a funeral pageant to a native statesman our festivals are chiefly on occasions of economic interest daily toil is suspended and gala assemblies convene to rejoice over the completion of an aqueduct or a railroad or the launching of an ocean steamer one of the earliest of these economical displays n new york memorable equally from the great principle it initiated and the felicitous auguries of the holiday itself as the celebration of the opening of the erie canal the first of a series of grand internal improvements which have since advanced our national prosperity beyond all historical precedent and one of the last was the grand excursion which signalized the union by railroads of the atlantic seacoast and the mississippi river the two celebrations were but festive landmarks in one magnificent system the enterprise initiated in western new york in was consummated in illinois in when the last link was riveted to the chain which binds the vast line of eastern seacoast to the great river of the west and the genius of communication so essential to our unity and prosperity brought permanently together the boundless harvestields of the interior and the mighty fleets of the seaboard to european eyes the sight of the thousand invited guests conveyed from new york to the falls of st anthony would yield a thrilling impression of the scale of festal arrangements in this republic and were they to scan the reports of popular anniversaries and conventions in our journals embracing every class and vocation representative of every art trade and interest a conviction would inevitably arise that we are the most social and holiday nation in the world on the constant qui vive for any plausible excuse for public dinners speeches processions songs toasts and other republican divertisements one month brings round the anniversary banquet of the printers when franklin memory is invoked and his story rehearsed another is marked by the annual symposium and contributions of the dramatic fund a temperance jubilee is announced toay a picnic of spiritualists toorrow here we encounter a long train of sunday scholars and there are invited to a publishers feast in a rystal palace the triumph of the acht america must be celebrated this week and the anniversary of clay birth or webster death the next a clerk delivers a poem before a mercantile library association a mechanic addresses his fellows exhibitions of fruit of fowls of cattle of machines of horses ploughingatches schools and pictures lead to social gatherings and volunteer discourses and make a holiday now for the farmer and now for the artisan so that the programme of festivals such as they are is coextensive with the land and the calendar all this proves that there is no lack of holiday instinct among us but it also demonstrates that the spirit of utility the pride of occupation and the ambition of success interfuse the recreative as they do the serious life of america the american enters into festivity as if it were a serious business he cannot take pleasure naturally like the european and is pursued with a halfonscious remorse if he dedicates time to amusement so that even our holidays seem rather an ordeal to be gone through with than an occasion to be enjoyed at many of these f tes too we are painfully conscious of interested motives which are essentially opposed to genuine recreation capital is made of amusement as of every other conceivable element of our national life it is often to advertise the stock to introduce the breed to gain political influence to win fashionable suffrages to a scheme or a product of art or industry that these expensive arrangements are made these hospitalities exercised these guests convened too many of our soalled holidays are tricks of trade too many are exclusively utilitarian too many consecrate external success and material welleing and too few are based on sentiment taste and goodellowship in a panorama of national holidays therefore instead of a crowd of gracefullyttired rustics waltzing under trees an enthusiastic chorus breathing as one deep voice the popular chant ladies veiled in tulle following an imperial infant to a cathedral altar the garlands and maidens of old england mayay or the splendid evolutions of the continental soldiery e should be most aptly represented by a fleet of steamers with crowded decks and gay pennons sweeping through the lofty and wooded bluffs of the upper mississippi the procession of boats and regiment of marines disembarking in the bay of jeddo or the old hall in whose sleeping echoes lives the patriotic eloquence of the revolution alive with hundreds of children invited by the city authorities to the annual school festival for these occasions typify the enterprise at home the exploration abroad and the system of public instruction which constitute our specific and absolute distinction in the family of nations a jovial eclectic could notwithstanding gather traces of the partial and isolated festivals of every race and country in america arvestongs among the german settlers of pennsylvania here a olden wedding there a private grapeeast in the south a tournament at hoboken a cricketatch and an archery club at sunnyside a vienna lagereer dance in new york or a vineressers merryaking in ohio if from those holidays which arise from temporary causes we turn to those which from annual recurrence aspire to the dignity of institutions the first thing which strikes us is their essentially local character ilgrimay wherever kept is a new england festival vacuationay belongs to the city of new york the anniversary of the battle of bunker hill is celebrated only in charlestown and the victory on lake erie at newport where its hero resided the events thus commemorated deserve their eminence in our regard and patriotic sentiment is excited and maintained by such observances yet in many instances they have dwindled to a lifeless parade and in others have become a somewhat invidious exaggeration of local selfomplacency the latter is the case for instance with the new england society annual feast in the commercial metropolis of the union it occasionally tries the patience and vexes the liberal sentiment of the considerate son of new england to hear the reiterated laudation of her schools her clergy her women her codfish and her granite at the hospitable board where sits perhaps a venerable knickerbocker conscious that the glib orators and their people have worked themselves into all places of honour and profit where the honest burgomaster used to smoke the pipe of peace and comfort in his generous portico his children now superseded by the restless emigrants from the eastern states thus boastfully tracing all that redeems and sustains the republic to the wisdom foresight and moral superiority of their own peculiar ancestry the style of the festival is often in bad taste there is too little recognition of the hospitality of their adopted home too little respect for manhattan blood an exuberance of language too conspicuously triumphant over a race which the best of comic histories illustrates by the reign of peter the silent so that at length a jocose reproof was administered by the toast of a humorist present who gave with irresistible nasal emphasis lymouth rock he blarneytone of new england it is however an appropriate illustration of the cosmopolitan population of new york that every year her english scotch welsh irish french german and dutch children after their own fashion recall their respective national associations in point of oratory the new england society carries the day inasmuch as it usually presses into its service some distinguished speaker from abroad in geniality antique customs and longrawn reminiscences the st

as when the absence of locomotive facilities made it a rare privilege for the scattered members of a household to come together around the paternal hearth the occasion has also diminished in value as one of clerical emancipation from sabbath themes when the preacher could expatiate unreproved on the questions of the day and the aspects of the times hat privilege being now exercised at will on the regular day of weekly religious service astay has also become anomalous its abolition or identification with good friday has been repeatedly advocated strictly speaking its title is a misnomer and the actual observance of it is too partial and ineffective to have any true significance an old town on the northastern extremity of an island the nearest approach to which overland is from the southern shore of cape cod was eagerly visited annually until within a few years by those who delight in primitive character and local festivals the broad plain beyond the town was long held in common property by the inhabitants as a sheepasture it may be that the maritime occupations of the natives their insular position and frugal habits imparted by contrast a singular relish to the rural episode thus secured in their lives of hazardous toil and dreary absence as sailors and whalemen but it is remarkable that amid the sands of that island flourished one of the heartiest and most characteristic of new england festivals simplicity of manners hardihood frankness the genial spirit of the mariner and the unsophisticated energy and kindliness of the sailor wife gave to the nantucket heephearing a rare and permanent freshness and charm unfortunately discord arising from the conflicting interests of these primitive islanders at length made it desirable to restore peace by sacrificing the flocks provocations of this domestic feud he sheep were sold and the unique festival to which they gave occasion vanished with them we must turn to that most available resource an old newspaper for a description of this now obsolete holiday sheephearing his patriarchal festival was celebrated on monday and tuesday last in this place with more than ordinary interest for some days previous the sheeprivers had been busily employed in collecting from all quarters of the island the dispersed members of the several flocks and committing them to the great sheepfold about two miles from town preparatory to the ceremonies of ablution and devestment he principal enclosure contains three hundred acres towards one side of this area and near the margin of a considerable pond are four or five circular fences one within the other ike captain symmes concentric curves nd about twenty feet apart forming a sort of labyrinth into these circuits the sheep are gradually driven so as to be designated by their eararks and secured for their proper owners in sheepcotes arranged laterally or nearly so around the exterior circle contiguous to these smaller pens each of which is calculated to contain about one hundred sheep the respective owners had erected temporary tents wherein the operation of shearing was usually performed the number of hands engaged in this service may be imagined from the fact that one gentleman is the owner of about sheep another of and numerous others of smaller flocks varying in number from three or four hundred down to a single dozen the business of identifying seizing and yarding the sheep creates a degree of bustle that adds no small amusement to the general activity of the scene the whole number of sheep and lambs brought within the great enclosure is said to be there are also several large flocks commonly sheared at other parts of the island s these are the only important holidays which the inhabitants of nantucket have ever been accustomed to observe it is not to be marvelled at that all other business should on such occasions be suspended and that the labours attendant thereon should be mingled with a due share of recreation accordingly the fancies of the juvenile portion of our community are for a long time prior to the annual shearing occupied in dreams of fun and schemes of frolic with the mind eye they behold the long array of tents surmounted with motley banners flaunting in the breeze and stored with tempting titbits candidates for money and for mastication with the mind ear they distinguish the spirittirring screak of the fiddle the gruff jangling of the drum the somniferous smorzando of the jewsarp and the enlivening scuffle of little feet in a helterkelter jig upon a deal platform and their visions unlike those of riper mortals are always realized for be it known that independent of the preparations made by persons actually concerned in the mechanical duties of the day there are erected on a rising ground in the vicinity of the sheepield some twenty pole and sailloth edifices furnished with seats and tables and casks and dishes severally filled with jocund faces baked pigs punch and cakes and surrounded with divers savoury concomitants in the premises courteously dispensed by the changeful master of ceremonies studious of custom and emulous of cash for the accommodation of those merry urchins and youngsters who choose to trip it on the light fantastic toe a floor is laid at one corner over which presides some african genius of melody brandishing a cracked violin and drawing most moving notes from its agonized intestines by dint of griping fingers and rightngled elbows e know of no parallel for this section of the entertainment other than what the boston boys were wont to denominate nigger ection o called in contradistinction from artillery election at the former anniversary which is the day on which who is governor is officially announced the blacks and blackees are

hallowed neighbourhood of nobility n previous days the sheep had been collected from every quarter of the island driven into the great fold at miacomet the site of an ancient indian settlement about a mile from tow selected and identified by their respective owners placed in separate pens and subjected to the somewhat arduous process of washing in the large pond contiguous after this preparatory ablution they were then ready to throw off this muddy vesture of decay by the aid of some hundreds of shearers who began to ply their vocation on monday morning seated in rude booths or beneath umbrageous awnings ranged around the circular labyrinth of enclosures wherein the panting animals awaited the divestment of their uncomfortable jackets the space partially occupied by the unshorn sheep and their contented lambs and in other spots exhibiting multitudes stripped of their fleece and clamorously seeking their wandering young presented to the eye and ear of the stranger sights and sounds somewhat rare we have sometimes been tempted to believe that all illustrious occasions men and things in this republic must inevitably be profaned hat as a compensatory balance to the reatest good of the greatest number secured by democratic institutions there must exist a sacrifice of the hallowed aspiring and consecrated elements of national feeling and achievement if there is an anniversary which should compel respect excite eternal gratitude and win unhackneyed observance it is that of the day when for the first time in the world history the select intelligences of a country proclaimed to the nations with deliberate and resolved wisdom the principles of human equality and the right of selfovernment pledged thereto their lives fortunes and honour and consistently redeemed the heroically prophetic pledge subsequent events have only deepened the significance of that act and extended its agency every succeeding year has increased its moral value and its material fruits the career of other and less happy nations has given more and more relief to its isolated grandeur and not a day fraught with more hope and glory lives in the calendar yet what is the actual observance the average estimation it boasts among us in our large cities especially in new york ndependence is by universal consent a nuisance it is most auspicious to the chinese from increasing the importation of firerackers the municipal authorities provide for it as for a lawless saturnalia the fireepartment dread its approach as indicative of conflagrations physicians as hazardous to such

programme of angloaxon methods of popular rejoicing to indicate the exclusive and ultimate style of our national holiday on its earlier recurrence when many of the actors in the scenes it commemorates still lived there was an interest and a meaning in the ceremonies which time has lessened yet it is difficult to account for the absence of all that high civilization presupposes in the celebration of our only holiday which can strictly be called national and if the sympathies of the most intelligent of our citizens could be enlisted so as to make the occasion a genuine patriotic jubilee nstead of a noisy carnival or a time for political animosity to assert itself with special emphasis uch would be gained on the score of rational enjoyment and american fraternity as it is although the undred boston orators nobly vindicate the talent and good taste of one city in regard to this anniversary and is a most pleasing historical memorial of the occasion it cannot be denied that our usual synonyme for bombast and mere rhetorical patriotism is fourth of july oration and that pickwickian sentiment pyrotechnic flashes torpedoes arrests bursting cannon draggled flags crowded steamboats the retiracy of the educated and the uproar of the multitude make up the confused and wearisome details of what should and might be a sacred feast a pious memory a hallowed consecration a abbath day of freedom perhaps the real zest of this holiday is felt only abroad when under some remote consular flag at the board of private and munificent hospitality in london or at an american r union in the french capital distance from home the ties of common nativity in a foreign land and the contrast of uneducated masses or despotic insignia around with the prosperous free and enlightened population of our own favoured country to say nothing of superior festal arrangements render the occasion at once charming and memorable one of the most noticeable features of american life to a stranger eye is the prevalent habit of travel and although the incessant and huge caravans that rush along the numerous railways which make an iron network over this union are for the most part impelled by motives of enterprise and thrift yet the common idea of recreation is associated with a rip whether the facilities or the temperament of our country or both be the reason of this locomotive propensity it is a characteristic which at once distinguishes the american from the homeethered german the parisound frenchman and the locallyatriotic italian the schoolboy in vacation the college graduate the bridegroom the overtasked professional man americans who give themselves a oliday are wont to dedicate it to a journey but even this resource has lost much of its original charm from the catastrophes which have associated some of the most beautiful scenery of the land with the most agonizing of human tragedies in the crystal waters of lake george by the picturesque banks of the hudson amid the fertile valleys of the connecticut on the teeming currents of long island sound have perished often through reckless hardihood always by more or less reprehensible negligence some of the fairest and the noblest of our citizens the statistics of these melancholy events which have so often appalled the public have yet to be written but their moral effect may be divined by a mere glance at the mercenary hardihood and soulless haste that mark our civilization es dangers personnels says an acute writer uand ils attegnent une certaine limite bouleversent tous les rapports et lublie de lsp rance chang presque notre nature the zest too of a journey in america is much diminished by the monotonous character of the people and by the gregarious habits the rapid transits and the business motives of the voyageurs so that it is only at the terminus that we enjoy our pilgrimage there the sight of a magnificent prairie or mountain range cataract or mammoth cave may indeed vindicate our locomotive taste and the wonders of nature make for the imaginative and reverential a glorious holiday a pleasing feature in the recreative aspect of american life is the literary festival it is a beautiful custom of our scholars annually to meet amid the scenes of their academical education and renew youthful friendships while they listen to the orator and poet who dwell upon those problems of the times which challenge an intellectual solution and identify the duties of the citizen with the offices of learning within the memory of almost all there is probably at least one of these occasions when the interest of the performances or the circumstances of the hour lent a memorable charm to the collegiate holiday when under the shade of venerable elms that witnessed the first outpouring of mental enthusiasm or the earliest honours of genius and attainment they who parted as boys meet as men and the classic dreamer felt himself a recognized and practical thinker for the people when the language of eloquent wisdom or poetic beauty came warm from lips hallowed by the chalice of fame who that listened ever can forget the anniversary graced by the chaste eloquence of buckminster that on which bryant recited the ages or everett musical periods welcomed lafayette to the oldest seat of american learning what new england scholar after years of professional labour in a distant state ever found himself once more within the charmed precincts of his alma mater and surrounded by the companions of his youthful studies without a thrill of happy reminiscence yet even these rational opportunities for what should be a genuine holiday to mind and heart are but casually appreciated the sultry period of their occurrence the irregularity of attendance and the precarious quality of the east of reason provided have caused them gradually to lose a tenacious hold upon the affections while there are few habitu s the majority especially those who live at a distance from the scene and whose presence is therefore especially desirable re not loyal pilgrims to the shrine where their virgin distinction was earned and their intellectual armour forged to many our literary festivals are but technical ceremonies to not a few wearisome forms associated rather with fans didactics perspiration and cold viands than with any social or intellectual refreshment the ean annuitant who loved to visit xford in vacation and fancy himself a gownsman and the ingenious pium eater who has recorded the enduring claims of those venerable cloisters to the scholar gratitude enjoyed speculatively more of the real luxury of academic repose and triumph than is often attained by those who ostensibly participate in our college festivals and seldom do her children go up to the altars of wisdom consecrated by the pious zeal of our ancestors with the faithful recognition of the venerable pastor so long the statistical oracle of the surviving graduates who while his strength sufficed cheerily walked from his rural parish to old harvard to lead off the anniversary psalm with genial pride and honest selfratulation of our purely social holidays new year day as observed in the city of new york bears the palm initiated by the hospitable instinct of the dutch colonists neither the heterogeneous population which has succeeded them nor the annually enlarged circuit of the metropolis has diminished the universality or the heartiness of its observance when the snow is massed in the thoroughfares and the sunshine tempers a clear frosty atmosphere a more cheerful scene on a large scale it is impossible to imagine from morning to midnight sleighs freighted with gay companions and drawn by handsome steeds dash merrily along he tinkling of their bells and the scarlet lining their buffaloobes redolent of a f te the sidewalks are alive with hurrying pedestrians who exchange cordial greetings as they pass one another doors incessantly fly open guests come and go every one looks prosperous and happy business is totally suspended in warm parlours radiant with comfort or splendid with luxury sit the wives daughters sisters or fair favourites of these innumerable visitors the queens of the day the neglects of the past are forgiven and forgotten in the welcome of the present kindred friends and acquaintances all meet and begin the year with mutual good wishes in every dwelling a little feast stands ready encompassed with smiles and all varieties of fortune all degrees of intimacy all tastes in dress entertainment and manners on this one day are consecrated by the liberal and kindly spirit of a social carnival of associations expressly instituted for the observance of holidays there is no lack of days technically devoted to festivity in the aggregate our proportion equals that of older communities and the legitimate occasions for pastime and ceremony social pleasure or historical commemoration are as numerous as is consistent with the industrious habits and the civic prosperity of the land the traveller who should make it his specialty to discover and note the ostensible merrymakings and pageants of america would find the list neither brief nor monotonous in the summer he would light upon many an excursion on our beautiful lakes many a chowderarty to the seaside and picnic in the grove and in the winter would catch the shrill echo of the skating frolic here through pillared trunks he would behold the smokereaths of the sugaramp there watch laughing groups clustered round the ciderill or hopield and in woods radiant with autumnal tints or prairies balmy with a million flowers would sounds of merriment announce to him the cheerful bivouac nor have american holidays even in their most primitive aspect been devoid of use and beauty the onceenowned usters fostered military taste and the cattlehows encouraged agricultural science with the increase of horticultural festivals our fruits and flowers have constantly improved regattas and yachtlubs have indirectly promoted nautical architecture school festivals attest the superiority of our system of popular education family gatherings on the large scale observed in several instances have induced genealogical research historical celebrations have led to the collection and preservation of local archives and memorials the cincinnati society annually renews the noblest patriotic sympathies and the genius for mechanical invention is proclaimed by the fairs which every october bring together so many trophies of skilful handiwork and husbandry and recognize so emphatically the dignity and scientific amelioration of labour yet these facts do not invalidate the general truth that our festivals are too much tinctured with utilitarian aims to breathe earnestness and hilarity that they are so specific as to represent the division rather than the social triumphs of human toil that they are too partial in their scope too sectional in their objects and too isolated in their arrangements to meet the claims of popular and permanent interests our harvests are songless reapingachines have diminished the zest of autumn golden largess as destructive inventions have lessened the miracles of chivalry here and there may yet convene a quiltingarty but locomotive facilities have deprived rural gatherings in sparse neighbourhoods of their marvel and their joy and the hilarious huskings of old chiefly survive in barlow neglected verse he days grow short but though the fallen sun to the glad swain proclaims his day work done night pleasant shades his various tasks prolong and yield new subjects to my various song for now the cornouse filled the harvest home the invited neighbours to the husking come a frolic scene where work and mirth and play unite their charms to chase the hours away where the huge heap lies centred in the hall the lamp suspended from the cheerful wall brown corned nymphs and strong hardanded beaux alternate ranged extend in circling rows assume their seats the solid mass attack the dry husks rustle and the cornobs crack the song the laugh alternate notes resound and the sweet cider trips in silence round the laws of husking every wight can tell and sure no laws he ever keeps so well for each red ear a general kiss he gains with each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains but when to some sweet maid a prize is cast red as her lips and taper as her waist she walks the round and culls one favoured beau who leaps the luscious tribute to bestow various the sports as are the wits and brains of wellleased lasses and contending swains till the vast mound of corn is swept away and he that gets the last ear wins the day progress in taste and sentiment however is already obvious in our recreative arrangements there is vastly more of intellectual dignity and permanent use in the f tes of the lyceum than in those of the trainingays and electionubilees which formerly were the chief holidays of our rural population exhibitions of flowers mark a notable advance upon the coarse diversions of the ring and the raceround and within a few years statues by native artists worthy of their illustrious subjects have been inaugurated by public rites and noble eloquence a radical cause of the inefficiency and therefore of the indifferent observance of our holidays may be found in our national inadequacy of expression in the want of those modes of popular rejoicing and ceremonial that win and triumph from their intrinsic beauty as a general truth it may be asserted that but two methods of representing holiday sentiment are native to the average taste of our people ilitary display and oral discourse these exhaust our festal resources our citizens have an extraordinary facility in making occasional speeches and the love of soldiership is so prevalent that it is the favourite sport of children and all classes indulge in costly uniforms and volunteer parades but the language of art which in the old world lends such a permanent attraction to holidays with us hardly finds voice had we requiems conceived with the eternal pathos of mozart harmonious embodiments of rural pastime like that which beethoven caught while sitting on a style amid the subdued murmurs of a summer evening melodious invocations to freedom such as bellini thrilling duo were a symphony as readily composed in america as an oration tableaux costumes and processions as artistically invented here as in france were dance and song as spontaneously expressive as among the european peasantry had we vast open magnificent temples free gardens statues to crown shrines to frequent palatial balconies fields elysian for both rich and poor a sensibility to music and a sense of the appropriate and beautiful as wide and as instinctive as our appreciation of the useful the practical and the comfortable t would no longer be requisite to resort exclusively to drums fifes powder substantial viands and speechifying to give utterance to the common sentiment which would find vent in tones forms hues combinations and sympathies that respond to the heart through the imagination and conform he show of things to the desires of the mind other causes of our deficient holidays are obvious the primary are to be found in the absorption in business and the dominion of practical habits both of thought and action enterprise holds carnival while poetry keeps lent the facts of toay shut out of view the perspective of time or at best lure the gaze forward with boundless expectancy to rehearse the fortunate achievements of the past gratifies our national egotism but the sensibility and meditation which consecrate historical associations find no room amid the rush and eagerness of the passing hour content to point to the heroic episode of the revolution to the wisdom and justice of our constitution to the caravans that sweep on iron tracks over leagues of what a few years ago was a pathless forest to the swiftest keels and most graceful models that traverse the ocean to the a rial viaducts that span dizzy heights and impetuous torrents to the exquisite vignettes of a limitless paper currency to the dignified and consistent maintenance of usurped law in younger states of the union and to the continually increasing resources of its older members we are disposed to sneer at the childish love of amusement which beguiles the inhabitants of european capitals and to pity the superstition and idleness which retain in this enlightened age the melodramatic church shows of romanism in all this there is doubtless a certain manly intelligence but there is also an inauspicious moral hardihood if as a people we cultivated more heartily the social instincts and humane sentiments expressed in holiday rites life would be more valued the whole nature would find congenial play and our taskwork and duty our citizenship and our natural advantages would be adorned by gracefulness alacrity and repose quantity would not be so grossly estimated above quality speed above security routine above enjoyment we need to win from time what is denied to us in material other nations have in art a permanent and accessible refreshment which prevents life from being wholly prosaic the humblest dweller on english soil can enter a timeallowed and beautiful cathedral the poorest rustic in italy can feel the honest pride of a distinctive festal attire the veriest clodopper in germany can soften the rigours of poverty by music the london apprentice may wander once a week amid the venerable beauties of hampton court and the parisian shopkeeper may kindle pride of country by reading the pictorial history of france at versailles it is not the expensive arrangements but the national provision and above all the personal sentiment which makes the holiday there was more holy rapture in the low cadence of the hymn stealing from the roman catacombs where the hunted christians of old kept holy the sabbath day than there is in the gorgeous display and complex melody under the magnificent dome of st peter there was more of the grace of festivity in such a dance as poor goldsmith flute enlivened on the banks of the loire than there is in the grand ball which marks the season climax at an american wateringlace in public not less than private banquets the scriptural maxim holds true etter is a dinner of herbs where love is our national life is too diffusive to yield the best social fruits the extent of territory the nomadic habits of our people the alternations of climate the vicissitudes of trade the prevalence of spasmodic and superficial excitements the boundless passion for gain the local changes the family separations and the incessant fevers of opinion scatter the holy fire of love reverence selfespect contemplation and faith what a senseless boast that the united states has thirtyive thousand miles of railroad while england claims but ninetywo hundred france fortyight hundred if against the american overplus are to be arrayed countless hecatombs of murdered fellowitizens and desolating frauds unparalleled in the history of finance what a mockery the distinction of having accumulated a fortune in a few years by sagacity and toil if to complete the record it is added that mercenary ambition risked and lost it in as many months or the want of selfontrol and mental resources made its possession a lifeong curse from ennui or tasteless extravagance it is as a check to the whirl of inconsiderate speculation an antidote to the bane of material luxury an interval in the hurried march of executive life that holidays should ive us pause and might prove a means of refinement and of disinterestedness we could thus infuse a better spirit into our workay experience refresh and warm the nation heart and gradually concentrate what of higher taste and more genial sympathy underlies the restless and cold tide that hurries us onward unmindful of the beauty and indifferent to the sanctities with which god and nature have invested our existence of natal anniversaries we have in our national calendar one which it would augur well for the republic to observe as a universal holiday every sentiment of gratitude veneration and patriotism has already consecrated it to the private heart and every consideration of unity good faith and american feeling designates its celebration as the most sacred civic f te of the land recent demonstrations in literature art and oratory indicate that the obligation and importance of keeping before the eyes minds and affections of the people the memory of washington are emphatically recognized by genius and popular sentiment within a few years the pen of our most endeared author the eloquence of our most finished orator and the chisel of our best sculptors have combined to exhibit in the most authentic and impressive forms of literary and plastic art the character and image of the father of his country copies of stuart masterly portrait have multiplied a monument bearing the revered name is slowly rising at the capital the materials of which are gathered from every part of the globe one of the last and most noble efforts to renew the waning national sentiment ere its lapse brought on civil war was that of a new england scholar patriot and orator who despite the allurements of prosperity and the claims of age and long service traversed the length and breadth of the republic eloquently expatiating on the character of washington retracing his spotless and great career and evoking his sacred memory as a talisman to quicken and combine a people love with the large contributions thus secured and those gathered by the daughters of the republic the home and grave of washington has been redeemed as national property let the first homage of a free people be paid at that shrine and alienated fellowitizens gather there as at a common altar his tomb is thus doubly hallowed in virginia is a sculptured memorial of enduring beauty and historical significance a new and admirable biography with all the elements of standard popularity makes his peerless career familiar to every citizen from the woods of maine to the shores of the pacific one effective statue already ornaments the commercial emporium and another is about to be erected in the city of boston these and many other signs of the times prove that the fanaticism of party strife has awakened the wise and loyal to a consciousness of the inestimable value of that great example and canonized name as a bond of union a conciliating memory and a glorious watchword desecrated as has been his native state by rebels against the government he founded and the nation he inaugurated profaned as has been his memory now that peace smiles upon the land his august image will reappear to every true loyal and patriotic heart with renewed authority and hallowed by a deeper love the present therefore is a favourable moment to institute the birthday of washington itherto but partially and ineffectually honoured s a solemn national festival around his tomb let us annually gather let eloquence and song leisure and remembrance trophies of art ceremonies of piety and sentiments of gratitude and admiration consecrate that day with an unanimity of feeling and of rites which shall fuse and mould into one pervasive emotion the divided hearts of the country until the discordant cries of faction are lost in the anthems of benediction and of love and before the august spirit of a people homage sectional animosity is awed into

quibble to a principle from the august minister of justice to the low pettifogger how great the distance yet all are included within a common pale in every social circle and family group there is an

thus instinctively arises the lawgiver sometimes ruling with the rude dogmatism of dr johnson and at others through the humorous good sense of sydney smith or the endearing tact of madame recamier these authorities in the sphere of opinion and companionship indicate how natural to human society is a recognized head whence emanates that controlling influence to which we give the name of law like every other element of life this loses somewhat of its native beauty when organized and made professional to every vocation there belong masterpirits who have established precedents and there are natural lawgivers as in art michael angelo and raphael in oratory demosthenes in philosophy bacon the endowments of each not only justify but originate their authority they interpret truth through their superior insight and wisdom in their respective departments of action and of thought but of the vast number who undertake to illustrate maintain or apply the laws which govern states a small minority are gifted for the task or aspire to its higher functions hence the proverbial abuse of the profession its few glorious ornaments and its herd of perverted slaves from this primary condition it is impossible for any human being to escape if he goes into the desert he is still subject to the laws of nature and however retired he may live amid his race the laws of society press upon him at

an attorney clerk one of the characters in a popular novel is made to say that he is never in company with a lawyer but he fancies himself in a witnessox this hit at the interrogative propensity of the class is by no means an exaggerated view of a use to which they are specially inclined to put conversation and if we compare the ordeal of inquiry to which we are thus subjected it will be found more thorough and better fitted to test our knowledge than that of any other social catechism so that perhaps we gain in discipline what we lose in patience it is to be acknowledged also that few men are better stocked with ideas or more fluent in imparting them than wellducated lawyers there is often a singular zest in their anecdotes a precision in their statement of facts and a dramatic style of narrative which render them the pleasantest of companions in all clever coteries of which we have any genial record there usually figures a lawyer as a wit a boon companion an entertaining dogmatist or an intellectual champion in literature the claims and demerits of the profession are emphatically recognized and it is curious to note the varied inferences of philosophers and authors

declares no man departs more from justice sancho panza said his master would prattle more than three attorneys and coleridge thought that pon the whole the advocate is placed in a position unfavourable to his moral being and indeed to his intellect also in its higher powers while it was a maxim of wilkes that scoundrel and lawyer are synonymous terms our pioneer litt rateur brockden brown whose imaginative mind revolted at the dry formalities of the law for which he was originally intended defined it as tissue of shreds and remnants of a barbarous antiquity patched by the stupidity of modern workmen into new deformity n the study of law remarks the poet gray he labour is long and the elements dry and uninteresting nor was there ever any one not disgusted at the

observant eye by a certain inscrutable expression and dickens has given this not exaggerated picture of a class in the profession mokeried and faded dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them

this box and must the inheritor himself have no more the diversities of the profession in england and america are curious and suggestive already is the obligation mutual for if in the old country there are more profound and elaborate resources in the new the science has received brilliant elucidations and its forms and processes been simplified there routine is apt to dwarf and here variety to dissipate the lawyer ability there he is too often a mere drudge and here his vocation regarded as the vestibule only of political life in england the advocate knowledge is frequently limited to his special department and in america while it is less complete and accurate he is versed in many other subjects and apt at many vocations he americans says sydney smith re the first persons who have discarded in the administration of justice the tailor and his auxiliary the barber wo persons of endless importance in the codes and pandects of europe a judge administers justice without a calorific wig and partioloured gown n a coat and pantaloons he is obeyed however and life and property are not badly protected in the united states there can be no more striking contrast than that between the lives of the english chancellors and the american chief justices in the former regal splendour the vicissitudes of kingcraft and succession of religious transition of courts war the people and the nobility lend a kind of feudal splendour or tragic interest or deep intrigue to the career of the minister of justice he is surrounded with the insignia of his office big wigs scarlet robes ermine mantles the great seal interviews with royalty the trappings and the awe of power invest his person his career is identified with the national annals the lapse of time and historic associations lend a mysterious interest to his name in the background there is the martyrdom of thomas becket the speech of the fallen wolsey the scaffold of sir thomas more the inductive system and low ambition of bacon and the literary fame of clarendon yet in intellectual dignity our young republic need not shrink from the comparison the virginia stripling who drilled regulars in a huntinghirt is a high legal authority in both hemispheres here says one of marshall intelligent eulogists n english history is the judge whose mind was at once so enlarged and so systematic who had so thoroughly reduced professional science to general reason in whose disciplined intellect technical learning had so completely passed into native sense and now that kent commentaries have become the indispensable guide and reference of the entire profession who remembers except with pride that on his first circuit the court was often held in a barn with the hayloft for a bench a stall for a bar and the shade of a neighbouring appleree for a juryoom the majesty of justice the intellectual superiority of law as a pursuit is herein most evident disrobed of all external magnificence with no lofty and venerable halls imposing costume or array of officials the law yet borrows from the learning the fidelity and the genius of its votaries essential dignity and memorable triumphs f law no less can be said grandly observes hooker han that her seat is the bosom of god her voice the harmony of the world the most celebrated english lawyers have their american prototypes thus marshall has been compared to lord mansfield pinkney to erskine and wirt to sheridan who was a student of the middle temple though not called to the ba imperfect as are such analogies they yet indicate with truth a similarity of endowment or style of advocacy the diverse influence of the respective institutions of the two countries is however none the less apparent because of an occasional resemblance in the genius of eminent barristers the genuine british lawyer is recognized by the technical cast of his expression and habit of mind to a degree seldom obvious in this country indeed no small portion of the graduates of our colleges who select the law as a pursuit do so without any strong bias for the profession but with a view to the facilities it affords for entrance into public life some of these aspirants thus become useful servants of the state a few statesmen but the majority mere politicians and from the predominance of the latter class originate half the errors of american legislation for however much profound legal training may fit a man of ability for the higher functions of representative government a superficial knowledge and practice of law renders him only an adept in chicanery and the ift of the gab and it is easy to imagine how a mob of such adroit and ambitious partisans specially when brought together from the narrow sphere of village life ay pervert the great ends of legislative action they make the laws according to their own interests and there is no prospect of the reformation demanded in juridical practice while such a corps form the speaking and voting majority and act on what has been justly called the one great principle of english law to make business for itself two names appear on the roll of english lawyers which are identified with the worst characteristics of the race mpious wild and browbeating arrogance hat of jeffreys whose ferocious persecution of those suspected of complicity with monmouth rebellion forms one of the most scandalous chapters in the history of british courts and lord thurlow who in a more refined age won the alias of tiger for his rudeness inflexibility oaths and illanners his black brows and audible growls in beautiful contrast shine forth the law reformers of england whose benign eloquence and unwearied labour mitigated the sanguinary rigours of the criminal code and pressed the common law into the service of humanity romilly and erskine have gained a renown more enduring than that of learned and gifted advocates their professional glory is heightened and mellowed by the sacred cause it illustrates the trial by jury and habeas corpus are the grand privileges of england and our own country the integrity of the former has been invaded among us by the abuse incident to making judgeships elective and by the lawless spirit of the western communities while the conviction of such eminent criminals as earl ferrers dr dodd and fauntleroy prove how it has been and is respected by the public sentiment of england he great expense of the simplest lawsuit writes an english lawyer in a popular magazine nd the droll laws which force all english subjects into a court of equity for their sole redress in an immense number of cases lead at this present day to a very entertaining class of practical jokes i mean that ludicrous class in which the joke consists of a man taking and keeping possession of money or other property to which he even pretends to have no shadow of right but which he seizes because he knows that the whole will be swallowed up if the rightful owner should seek to assert his claim the instances which are cited are rather fitted to excite a sense of humiliation than of fun at the cruel injustice of a legal system which expressly organizes and protects robbery the legal treatises produced in england in modern times are wonderful monuments of erudition research and analytical power the intelligent lawyer who examines spence two volumes on equity does not wonder his brain gave way when thus far advanced on his gigantic task it is this patient study this complete learning which distinguishes the english lawyer in point of eloquence he is confessedly inferior to his irish and american brethren as they are to him in profundity in the careful and persistent application of common sense to the hoarded legal acquisitions of centuries the great minds of the english bar stand unrivalled it is indeed the most certain professional avenue to official power ely upon it says a brilliant novelist he barrister gown is the weddingarment to the british feast of fat things and veron declares that n france mais en france seulement un avocat est propre tout tandis qun decin nst jug propre rien qu hanter les h pitaux in this country the lawyers of each state have a characteristic reputation the bar of boston as a whole is more english that of the south more irish in its general merits marshall was an exception to the eloquent fame of american lawyers born and bred south of the potomac his superiority was logical im exclusively at strength was his maxim and lose compact simple but irresistible logic his great distinction wheaton labours in behalf of international and hamilton in that of constitutional law have laid the civilized world as well as their native country under high and lasting obligations the popular estimate of a profession is dependent on circumstances and this like every other human pursuit takes its range and tone from the character of its votary and the existent relation it holds to public sentiment not so much from what it technically demands but from the spirit in which it is followed come the dignity and the shame of the law the erudite generalizations of savigny belong to the most difficult and enlarged sphere of thought while the cunning tergiversations of the legal adventurer identify him with sharpers and roguery how characteristic of burr that he should sarcastically define law as hatever is boldly asserted and plausibly maintained in the first cycle of our republic when a liberal education was rare the best lawyers were ornaments of society and the intellectual benefactors of the country in that study were disciplined the chivalrous minds of marshall hamilton adams morris and other statesmen of the revolution a trial which afforded the least scope for their remarkable powers was attended by the intelligent citizens with very much the same kind of interest as filled the athenian theatre mental banquet was confidently expected and deeply enjoyed to have a great legal reputation then implied all that is noble in intellect graceful in manner and courteous in spirit t bespoke the scholar the gentleman and the wit as well as the advocate when emmet came hither with the prestige of inherited patriotism and talents as well as the claims of an exile he found men at the bar whose eloquence rivalled the fame of curran and grattan in scotland lawyers are eminently identified with social distinction and arrangements he fact of the substitution of the legal profession for the old scottish aristocracy says a late review n the chief place in edinburgh society is typified by the circumstance that the soalled parliament house which is on the site of the ancient hall where the estates of the kingdom sat when the nation made its own laws is now the seat of the scottish lawourts and the daily resort of the interpreters of the land the general hour of breakfast in edinburgh is determined by the time when the courts open in the morning and dispersed through their homes or at dinnerarties in the evening it is the members of the legal profession that lead the social talk the equality of free institutions was never more aptly illustrated than by a scene which occurred in a courthouse we used to frequent in boyhood in order to hear the impassioned rhetoric of a gifted criminal lawyer a trial of peculiar interest was to come on the room was crowded with spectators and officials the judge a venerable specimen of the stern and dignified magistrate took his seat the sheriff announced the opening of the court and the clerk called over the names of those summoned to act as jurors we were startled to hear among those of grocers draymen and mechanics the wellnown name of an aristocratic millionaire it was thrice repeated and no answer given as that juror been duly summoned inquired the judge es your honour was the reply et two constables instantly bring him before us said the magistrate one can imagine the vexation of the rich gentleman of leisure when dawdling in a flowered robe de chambre over his sumptuous breakfast to be disturbed by those rude minions of the law however there was no alternative and he was obliged to despatch his meal and accompany the distasteful escort he entered the court where a deep silence prevailed with a supercilious smile and complacent air of wellred annoyance ow dare you keep the court waiting sir was the indignant salutation of the judge who perhaps when last in the gentleman company had sipped a glass delectable of old madeira to his health intended to pay my fine and not serve stammered the millionaire nd do you suppose sir that wealth exonerates you from the duties of a citizen and is any apology for your gross incivility in thus detaining the court for over an hour no excuse will be accepted either take your seat in the juryox or stand committed through the silent crowd the luxurious man of fortune threaded his way and sat down between a currier and wooderchant with whom he had to listen to the law and the evidence for a fortnight the author of the lives of the english chancellors refers to the usual explanation of the origin of the term as intended in compliment to the staple product of the realm and adds his own belief that in he rude simplicity of early times a sack of wool was frequently used as a sofa in the colonial era of our history when ceremony and etiquette ruled the public hall as well as the private drawingoom american judges wore the robe and wig still used in the old country these insignia of authority inspired an awe before the era of legal reform and of philosophical jurisprudence which comported with the tyrannous exercise of juridical power when it was little more than the medium of despotism and when the calm reproach of stafford was a literal truth t is better to be without laws altogether than to persuade ourselves that we have laws by which to regulate our conduct and to find that they consist only in the enmity and arbitrary will of our accusers the conveyancer writer to the signet attorney barrister and other divisions of the legal profession indicate how in this as in other vocations the division of labour operates in england while on this side of the water the contrary principle not only assigns to the lawyer a degree of knowledge and aptitude in each branch of his calling but lays him under contribution in every political and social exigency as an interpreter or advocate of public sentiment hence his remarkable versatility and comparatively superficial attainments in the history of english law the early struggles and profound acquirements of her disciples form the salient points while in that of america they are to be found rather in the primitive resources of justice and the varied career of her ministers with regard to the former our many racy descriptions of the process of western colonization abound in remarkable anecdotes of the unlicensed administration of justice after the pioneer comes the ranger a kind of border police then the regulator and finally the justice of the peace in the primitive communities when a flagrant wrong is committed a public meeting is called perhaps under an oaklump or in a green hollow the oldest settler is invited to the chair which is probably the trunk of a fallen tree the offence is discussed the offender identified volunteers scour the woods he is arraigned and if found guilty hung banished or reprimanded as the case may be with a despatch which is not less remarkable than the fair hearing he is allowed and the cool decision with which he is condemned
