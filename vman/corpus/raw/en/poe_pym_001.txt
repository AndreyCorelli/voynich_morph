upon my return to the united states a few months ago after the extraordinary series of adventure in the south seas and elsewhere of which an account is given in the following pages accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in richmond va who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions i had visited and who were constantly urging it upon me as a duty to give my narrative to the public i had several reasons however for declining to do so some of which were of a nature altogether private and concern no person but myself others not so much so one consideration which deterred me was that having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which i was absent i feared i should not be able to write from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties another reason was that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous that unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be except by the evidence of a single individual and he a halfreed india i could only hope for belief among my family and those of my friends who have had reason through life to put faith in my veracity he probability being that the public at large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction a distrust in my own abilities as a writer was nevertheless one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest interest in my statement more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean was mr poe lately editor of the southern literary messenger a monthly magazine published by mr thomas w white in the city of richmond he strongly advised me among others to prepare at once a full account of what i had seen and undergone and trust to the shrewdness and common sense of the public nsisting with great plausibility that however roughly as regards mere authorship my book should be got up its very uncouthness if there were any would give it all the better chance of being received as truth notwithstanding this representation i did not make up my mind to do as he suggested he afterward proposed finding that i would not stir in the matte that i should allow him to draw up in his own words a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures from facts afforded by myself publishing it in the southern messenger under the garb of fiction to this perceiving no objection i consented stipulating only that my real name should be retained two numbers of the pretended fiction appeared consequently in the messenger for january and february and in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction the name of mr poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the adventures in question for i found that in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the messenger without altering or distorting a single fac the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable and several letters were sent to mr p address distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence of their own authenticity and that i had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity this expos being made it will be seen at once how much of what follows i claim to be my own writing and it will also be understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages which were written by mr poe even to those readers who have not seen the messenger it will be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences the difference in point of style will be readily perceived a g pym nework july narrative of a gordon pym my name is arthur gordon pym my father was a respectable trader in seatores at nantucket where i was born my maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice he was fortunate in everything and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the edgarton newank as it was formerly called by these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money he was more attached to myself i believe than to any other person in the world and i expected to inherit the most of his property at his death he sent me at six years of age to the school of old mr ricketts a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners e is well known to almost every person who has visited new bedford i stayed at his school until i was sixteen when i left him for mr e ronald academy on the hill here i became intimate with the son of mr barnard a sea captain who generally sailed in the employ of and vredenburgh r barnard is also very well known in new bedford and has many relations i am certain in edgarton his son was named augustus and he was nearly two years older than myself he had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the john donaldson and was always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific ocean i used frequently to go home with him and remain all day and sometimes all night we occupied the same bed and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light telling me stories of the natives of the island of tinian and other places he had visited in his travels at last i could not help being interested in what he said and by degrees i felt the greatest desire to go to sea i owned a sailoat called the ariel and worth about seventyive dollars she had a halfeck or cuddy and was rigged sloopashion forget her tonnage but she would hold ten persons without much crowding in this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world and when i now think of them it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am alive toay i will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative one night there was a party at mr barnard and both augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated towards the close of it as usual in such cases i took part of his bed in preference to going home he went to sleep as i thought very quietly it being near one when the party broke u and without saying a word on his favourite topic it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed and i was just about falling into a doze when he suddenly started up and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest i never was so astonished in my life not knowing what he intended and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself he proceeded to talk very coolly however saying he knew that i supposed him intoxicated but that he was never more sober in his life he was only tired he added of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog and was determined to get up and dress and go out on a frolic with the boat i can hardly tell what possessed me but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world it was blowing almost a gale and the weather was very cold t being late in october i sprang out of bed nevertheless in a kind of ecstasy and told him i was quite as brave as himself and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any augustus barnard in nantucket we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumberard of pankey co and almost thumping her sides out against the rough logs augustus got into her and bailed her for she was nearly half full of water this being done we hoisted jib and mainsail kept full and started boldly out to sea the wind as i before said blew freshly from the southwest the night was very clear and cold augustus had taken the helm and i stationed myself by the mast on the deck of the cuddy we flew along at a great rate either of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf i now asked my companion what course he intended to steer and what time he thought it probable we should get back he whistled for a few minutes and then said crustily i am going to sea you may go home if you think proper turning my eyes upon him i perceived at once that in spite of his assumed nonchalance he was greatly agitated i could see him distinctly by the light of the moon is face was paler than any marble and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller i found that something had gone wrong and became seriously alarmed at this period i knew little about the management of a boat and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend the wind too had suddenly increased as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land till i was ashamed to betray any trepidation and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence i could stand it no longer however and spoke to augustus about the propriety of turning back as before it was nearly a minute before he made answer or took any notice of my suggestion byndy said he at length time enough ome byndy i had expected a similar reply but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread i again looked at the speaker attentively his lips were perfectly livid and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand for god sake augustus i screamed now heartily frightened what ails you hat is the matter hat are you going to do matter he stammered in the greatest apparent surprise letting go the tiller at the same moment and falling forward into the bottom of the boat matter hy nothing is the atter oing home on you see the whole truth now flashed upon me i flew to him and raised him up he was drunk eastly drunk e could no longer either stand speak or see his eyes were perfectly glazed and as i let him go in the extremity of my despair he rolled like a mere log into the bilgeater from which i had lifted him it was evident that during the evening he had drunk far more than i suspected and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highlyoncentrated state of intoxication state which like madness frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses the coolness of the night air however had had its usual effect he mental energy began to yield before its influence nd the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe he was now thoroughly insensible and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror the fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated leaving me doubly timid and irresolute i knew that i was altogether incapable of managing the boat and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction a storm was evidently gathering behind us we had neither compass nor provisions and it was clear that if we held our present course we should be out of sight of land before daybreak these thoughts with a crowd of others equally fearful flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion the boat was going through the water at a terrible rate ull before the wind o reef in either jib or mainsail unning her bows completely under the foam it was a thousand wonders she did not broach to ugustus having let go the tiller as i said before and i being too much agitated to think of taking it myself by good luck however she kept steady and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of mind still the wind was increasing fearfully and whenever we rose from a plunge forward the sea behind fell combing over our counter and deluged us with water i was so utterly benumbed too in every limb as to be nearly unconscious of sensation at length i summoned up the resolution of despair and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run as might have been expected it flew over the bows and getting drenched with water carried away the mast short off by the board this latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction under the jib only i now boomed along before the wind shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter but relieved from the terror of immediate death i took the helm and breathed with greater freedom as i found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat and as there was imminent danger of his drowning the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fel i contrived to raise him partially up and keep him in a sitting position by passing a rope round his waist and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of the cuddy having thus arranged everything as well as i could in my chilled and agitated condition i recommended myself to god and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power hardly had i come to this resolution when suddenly a loud and long scream or yell as if from the throats of a thousand demons seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i experienced at that moment my hair stood erect on my head felt the blood congealing in my veins y heart ceased utterly to beat and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fallen companion i found myself upon reviving in the cabin of a large whalinghip the pengui bound to nantucket several persons were standing over me and augustus paler than death was busily occupied in chafing my hands upon seeing me open my eyes his exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and tears from the roughooking personages who were present the mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained we had been run down by the whalinghip which was close hauled beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course several men were on the lookut forward but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact heir shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me the huge ship i was told rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress not a scream arose from the deck of the victim here was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer ut this was all thinking our boat which it will be remembered was dismaste some mere shell cut adrift as useless the captain captain e t block of new londo was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter luckily there were two of the lookut who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm and represented the possibility of yet saving him a discussion ensued when block grew angry and after a while said that it was no business of his to be eternally watching for egghells that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense and if there was a man run down it was nobody fault but his own e might drown and be or some language to that effect henderson the first mate now took the matter up being justly indignant as well as the whole ship crew at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity he spoke plainly seeing himself upheld by the men told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore he strode aft jostling block who turned very pale and made no answe on one side and seizing the helm gave the word in a firm voice hardee the men flew to their posts and the ship went cleverly about all this had occupied nearly five minutes and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved any to have been on board the boat yet as the reader has seen both augustus and myself were rescued and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of providence while the ship was yet in stays the mate lowered the jollyoat and jumped into her with the very two men i believe who spoke up as having seen me at the helm they had just left the lee of the vessel the moon still shining brightl when she made a long and heavy roll to windward and henderson at the same moment starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water he would say nothing else epeating his cry impatiently back water back water the men put back as speedily as possible but by this time the ship had gone round and gotten fully under headway although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail in despite of the danger of the attempt the mate clung to the mainhains as soon as they came within his reach another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough the body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom the penguin was coppered and copperastene and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull after several ineffectual efforts made during the lurches of the ship and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat i was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board or the body proved to be my own it appeared that one of the timberolts having started and broken a passage through the copper it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom the head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket i had on and through the back part of my neck forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear i was immediately put to bed lthough life seemed to be totally extinct there was no surgeon on board the captain however treated me with every attention o make amends i presume in the eyes of his crew for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure in the meantime henderson had again put off from the ship although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane he had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour although repeated signals to return were made them by captain block and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril indeed it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant she was built however for the whaling service and was fitted as i have since had reason to believe with airoxes in the manner of some lifeoats used on the coast of wales after searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned it was determined to get back to the ship they had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object which floated rapidly by they pursued and soon overtook it it proved to be the entire deck of the ariel cuddy augustus was struggling near it apparently in the last agonies upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber this rope it will be remembered i had myself tied round his waist and made fast to a ringbolt for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position and my so doing it appeared had been ultimately the means of preserving his life the ariel was slightly put together and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces the deck of the cuddy as might be expected was lifted by the force of the water rushing in entirely from the main timbers and floated with other fragments no doub to the surface ugustus was buoyed up with it and thus escaped a terrible death it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin before he could give any account of himself or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our boat at length he became thoroughly aroused and spoke much of his sensations while in the water upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness he found himself beneath the surface whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck in an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward when his head striking violently against a hard substance he again relapsed into insensibility upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason his was still however in the greatest degree clouded and confused he now knew that some accident had occurred and that he was in the water although his mouth was above the surface and he could breathe with some freedom possibly at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind and drawing him after it as he floated upon his back of course as long as he could have retained this position it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck and this post he endeavoured to maintain screaming at intervals for help just before he was discovered by mr henderson he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion and falling into the sea had given himself up for lost during the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the ariel nor of any matters in connexion with the source of his disaster a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties when he was finally picked up every power of his mind had failed him and as before said it was nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he became fully aware of his condition in regard to myself was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a hal by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil proceeding suggested by augustus the wound in my neck although of an ugly appearance proved of little real consequence and i soon recovered from its effects the penguin got into port about nine olock in the morning after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off nantucket both augustus and myself managed to appear at mr barnard in time for breakfast hich luckily was somewhat late owing to the party over night i suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance f course it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny schoolboys however can accomplish wonders in the way of deception and i verily believe not one of our friends in nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils had reference either to the ariel my companion or myself we two have since very frequently talked the matter over ut never without a shudder in one of our conversations augustus frankly confessed to me that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication and felt himself sinking beneath its influence chapter in no affairs of mere prejudice pro or con do we deduce inferences with entire certainty even from the most simple data it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea on the contrary i never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance this short period proved amply long enough to erase from my memory the shadows and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably exciting points of colour all the picturesqueness of the late perilous accident my conversations with augustus grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest he had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean more than one half of which i now suspect to have been sheer fabrication well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination it is strange too that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair for the bright side of the painting i had a limited sympathy my visions were of shipwreck and famine of death or captivity among barbarian hordes of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears upon some gray and desolate rock in an ocean unapproachable and unknown such visions or desires or they amounted to desires re common i have since been assured to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men t the time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind it is probable indeed that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial interchange of character about eighteen months after the period of the ariel disaster the firm of and vredenburgh a house connected in some manner with the messieurs enderby i believe of liverpoo were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a whaling voyage she was an old hulk and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be done i hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners ut so it was mr barnard was appointed to command her and augustus was going with him while the brig was getting ready he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel he found me by no means an unwilling listener et the matter could not be so easily arranged my father made no direct opposition but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design and more than all my grandfather from whom i expected much vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever broach the subject to him again these difficulties however so far from abating my desire only added fuel to the flame i determined to go at all hazards and having made known my intention to augustus we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished in the meantime i forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage and as i busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies it was supposed that i had abandoned the design i have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance of my project n hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time ould only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my longherished visions of travel in pursuance of my scheme of deception i was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of augustus who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the grampus attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold at night however we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes after nearly a month passed in this manner without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary i had a relation living in new bedford a mr ross at whose house i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time the brig was to sail about the middle of june june and it was agreed that a day or two before her putting to sea my father was to receive a note as usual from mr ross asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with robert and emmet his son augustus charged himself with the enditing of this note and getting it delivered having set out as supposed for new bedford i was then to report myself to my companion who would contrive a hidinglace for me in the grampus this hidinglace he assured me would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days during which i was not to make my appearance when the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question i should then he said be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin and as to his father he would only laugh heartily at the joke vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents the middle of june at length arrived and everything had been matured the note was written and delivered and on a monday morning i left the house for the new bedford packet as supposed i went however straight to augustus who was waiting for me at the corner of a street it had been our original plan that i should keep out of the way until dark and then slip on board the brig but as there was now a thick fog in our favour it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me augustus led the way to the wharf and i followed at a little distance enveloped in a thick seaman cloak which he had brought with him so that my person might not be easily recognised just as we turned the second corner after passing mr edmund well who should appear standing right in front of me and looking me full in the face but old mr peterson my grandfather why bless my soul gordon said he after a long pause why why whose dirty cloak is that you have on sir i replied assuming as well as i could in the exigency of the moment an air of offended surprise and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable tones sir you are a sumat mistaken y name in the first place beet nothing at all like goddin and i want you for to know better you blackguard than to call my new obercoat a darty one for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke he started back two or three steps turned first pale and then excessively red threw up his spectacles then putting them down ran full tilt at me with his umbrella uplifted he stopped short however in his career as if struck with a sudden recollection and presently turning round hobbled off down the street shaking all the while with rage and muttering between his teeth won do ew glasses hought it was gordon goodorothing salt water long tom after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution and arrived at our point of destination in safety there were only one or two of the hands on board and these were busy forward doing something to the forecastle combings captain barnard we knew very well was engaged at and vredenburgh and would remain there until late in the evening so we had little to apprehend on his account augustus went first up the vessel side and in a short while i followed him without being noticed by the men at work we proceeded at once into the cabin and found no person there it was fitted up in the most comfortable style thing somewhat unusual in a whalingessel there were four very excellent staterooms with wide and convenient berths there was also a large stove i took notice and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms the ceiling was full seven feet high and in short everything appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than i had anticipated augustus however would allow me but little time for observation insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible he led the way into his own stateroom which was on the starboard side of the brig and next to the bulkheads upon entering he closed the door and bolted it i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which i now found myself it was about ten feet long and had only one berth which as i said before was wide and convenient in that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square containing a table a chair and a set of hanging shelves full of books chiefly books of voyages and travels there were many other little comforts in the room among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator in which augustus pointed out to me a host of delicacies both in the eating and drinking department he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned letting me know that a portion of the flooring about sixteen inches square had been neatly cut out and again adjusted as he pressed this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath in this manner he raised the mouth of the trap to which the carpet was still fastened by tack and i found that it led into the after hold he next lit a small taper by means of a phosphorus match and placing the light in a dark lantern descended with it through the opening bidding me follow i did so and he then pulled the cover upon the hole by means of a nail driven into the under side he carpet of course resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom and all traces of the aperture being concealed the taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which i now found myself by degrees however my eyes became accustomed to the gloom and i proceeded with less trouble holding on to the skirts of my friend coat he brought me at length after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages to an ironound box such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware it was nearly four feet high and full six long but very narrow two large empty oilasks lay on the top of it and above these again a vast quantity of straw matting piled up as high as the floor of the cabin in every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible even up to the ceiling a complete chaos of almost every species of shipurniture together with a heterogeneous medley of crates hampers barrels and bales so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box i afterward found that augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment having had only one assistant in the labour a man not going out in the brig my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure he slipped it aside and displayed the interior at which i was excessively amused a mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space allowing me at the same time sufficient room for my accommodation either in a sitting position or lying at full length among other things there were some books pen ink and paper three blankets a large jug full of water a keg of seaiscuit three or four immense bologna sausages an enormous ham a cold leg of roast mutton and half a dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs i proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment and this with feelings of higher satisfaction i am sure than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box and then holding the taper close to the deck showed me a piece of dark whipcord lying along it this he said extended from my hidinglace throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold immediately beneath the trapdoor leading into his stateroom by means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance provided any unlookedor accident should render such a step necessary he now took his departure leaving with me the lantern together with a copious supply of tapers and phosphorus and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation this was on the seventeenth of june i remained three days and nights as nearly as i could gues in my hidinglace without getting out of it at all except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening during the whole period i saw nothing of augustus but this occasioned me little uneasiness as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me at length i heard the trap open and shut and presently he called in a low voice asking if all was well and if there was anything i wanted nothing i replied i am as comfortable as can be when will the brig sail she will be under weigh in less than half an hour he answered i came to let you know and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence i shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time erhaps for three or four days more all is going on right aboveboard after i go up and close the trap do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in you will find my watch there t may be useful to you as you have no daylight to keep time by i suppose you can tell how long you have been buried nly three days his is the twentieth i would bring the watch to your box but am afraid of being missed with this he went up in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in motion and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage satisfied with this idea i determined to make my mind as easy as possible and await the course of events until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy although hardly more comfortable accommodations of the cabin my first care was to get the watch leaving the taper burning i groped along in the dark following the cord through windings innumerable in some of which i discovered that after toiling a long distance i was brought back within a foot or two of a former position at length i reached the nail and securing the object of my journey returned with it in safety i now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided and selected the expedition of lewis and clarke to the mouth of the columbia with this i amused myself for some time when growing sleepy i extinguished the light with great care and soon fell into a sound slumber upon awaking i felt strangely confused in mind and some time elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation by degrees however i remembered all striking a light i looked at the watch but it was run down and there were consequently no means of determining how long i had slept my limbs were greatly cramped and i was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite i bethought myself of the cold mutton some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep and found excellent what was my astonishment at discovering it to be in a state of absolute putrefaction this circumstance occasioned me great disquietude for connecting it with the disorder of mind i experienced upon awaking i began to suppose that i must have slept for an inordinately long period of time the close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this and might in the end be productive of the most serious results my head ached excessively i fancied that i drew every breath with difficulty and in short i was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings still i could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise and having wound up the watch contented myself as well as possible throughout the whole of the next tedious twentyour hours no person came to my relief and i could not help accusing augustus of the grossest inattention what alarmed me chiefly was that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint and i was suffering much from thirst having eaten freely of the bologna sausages after the loss of my mutton i became very uneasy and could no longer take any interest in my books i was overpowered too with a desire to sleep yet trembled at the thought of indulging it lest there might exist some pernicious influence like that of burning charcoal in the confined air of the hold in the mean time the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean and a dull humming sound which reached my ears as if from an immense distance convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing i could not imagine a reason for the absence of augustus we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up some accident might have happened to him ut i could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner except indeed his having suddenly died or fallen overboard and upon this idea i could not dwell with any degree of patience it was possible that we had been baffled by head winds and were still in the near vicinity of nantucket this notion however i was forced to abandon for such being the case the brig must have frequently gone about and i was entirely satisfied from her continual inclination to the larboard that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter besides granting that we were still in the neighbourhood of the island why should not augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition i resolved to wait yet another twentyour hours when if no relief were obtained i would make my way to the trap and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend or get at least a little fresh air through the opening and a further supply of water from his stateroom while occupied with this thought however i fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary into a state of profound sleep or rather stupor my dreams were of the most terrific description every species of calamity and horror befell me among other miseries i was smothered to death between huge pillows by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect immense serpents held me in their embrace and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes then deserts limitless and of the most forlorn and awenspiring character spread themselves out before me immensely tall trunks of trees gray and leafless rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach their roots were concealed in widepreading morasses whose dreary water lay intensely black still and altogether terrible beneath and the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality and waving to and fro their skeleton arms were crying to the silent waters for mercy in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair the scene changed and i stood naked and alone amid the burning sandlains of zahara at my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me with a convulsive bound he sprang to his feet and laid bare his horrible teeth in another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament and i fell impetuously to the earth stifling in a paroxysm of terror i at last found myself partially awake my dream then was not all a dream now at least i was in possession of my senses the paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom is hot breath was in my ear nd his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of a syllable i could have neither stirred nor spoken the beast whatever it was retained his position without attempting any immediate violence while i lay in an utterly helpless and i fancied a dying condition beneath him i felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me n a word that i was perishing and perishing of sheer fright my brain swam grew deadly sick y vision failed ven the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim making a last strong effort i at length breathed a faint ejaculation to god and resigned myself to die the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal he precipitated himself at full length upon my body but what was my astonishment when with a long and low whine he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness and with the most extravagant demonstrations of affection and joy i was bewildered utterly lost in amazement ut i could not forget the peculiar whine of my newfoundland dog tiger and the odd manner of his caresses i well knew it was he i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had been lying and throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears as upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas ut by very slow degrees my thinking faculties returned and i again called to memory the several incidents of my condition for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude and render me comfort by his caresses most people love their dogs ut for tiger i had an affection far more ardent than common and never certainly did any creature more truly deserve it for seven years he had been my inseparable companion and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal i had rescued him when a puppy from the clutches of a malignant little villain in nantucket who was leading him with a rope around his neck to the water and the grown dog repaid the obligation about three years afterward by saving me from the bludgeon of a streetobber getting now hold of the watch i found upon applying it to my ear that it had again run down but at this i was not at all surprised being convinced from the peculiar state of my feelings that i had slept as before for a very long period of time how long it was of course impossible to say i was burning up with fever and my thirst was almost intolerable i felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water for i had no light the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern and the phosphorusox not coming readily to hand upon finding the jug however i discovered it to be empty iger no doubt having been tempted to drink it as well as to devour the remnant of mutton the bone of which lay well picked by the opening of the box the spoiled meat i could well spare but my heart sank as i thought of the water i was feeble in the extreme o much so that i shook all over as with an ague at the slightest movement or exertion to add to my troubles the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence and the oilasks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress i felt also terrible sufferings from seaickness these considerations determined me to make my way at all hazards to the trap and obtain immediate relief before i should be incapacitated from doing so altogether having come to this resolve i again felt about for the phosphorusox and tapers the former i found after some little trouble but not discovering the tapers as soon as i had expected for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had placed the i gave up the search for the present and bidding tiger lie quiet began at once my journey towards the trap in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along at all and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me when falling prostrate on my face i would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility still i struggled forward by slow degrees dreading every moment that i should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber in which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result at length upon making a push forward with all the energy i could command i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an ironound crate the accident only stunned me for a few moments but i found to my inexpressible grief that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path so as effectually to block up the passage with my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its position it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and shipurniture it became necessary therefore enfeebled as i was either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out a new passage or to climb over the obstacle and resume the path on the other side the former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder in my present weak state of both mind and body i should infallibly lose my way if i attempted it and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold i proceeded therefore without hesitation to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude and endeavour as i best might to clamber over the crate upon standing erect with this end in view i found the undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head or if this accident did not occur the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass as it was in front by the obstacle there the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box upon which no foothold could be obtained in vain i attempted by every means in my power to reach the top with the hope of being thus enabled to draw myself up had i succeeded in reaching it it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over and it was better in every respect that i failed at length in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground i felt a strong vibration in the side next me i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks and found that a very large one was loose with my pocketnife which luckily i had with me i succeeded after great labour in prying it entirely off and getting through the aperture discovered to my exceeding joy that there were no boards on the opposite side n other words that the top was wanting it being the bottom through which i had forced my way i now met with no important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally reached the nail with a beating heart i stood erect and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap it did not rise as soon as i had expected and i pressed it with somewhat more determination still dreading lest some other person than augustus might be in his stateroom the door however to my astonishment remained steady and i became somewhat uneasy for i knew that it had formerly required little or no effort to remove it i pushed it strongly t was nevertheless firm with all my strength t still did not give way with rage with fury with despair t set at defiance my utmost efforts and it was evident from the unyielding nature of the resistance that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up or that some immense weight had been placed upon it which it was useless to think of removing my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay in vain i attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed i could summon up no connected chain of reflection and sinking on the floor gave way unresistingly to the most gloomy imaginings in which the dreadful deaths of thirst famine suffocation and premature interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered at length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind i arose and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture having found them i examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the stateroom but none was visible i then forced the penblade of my knife through them until i met with some hard obstacle scraping against it i discovered it to be a solid mass of iron which from its peculiar wavy feel as i passed the blade along it i concluded to be a chainable the only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box and there either yield to my sad fate or try so to tranquillize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape i immediately set about the attempt and succeeded after innumerable difficulties in getting back as i sank utterly exhausted upon the mattress tiger threw himself at full length by my side and seemed as if desirous by his caresses of consoling me in my troubles and urging me to bear them with fortitude the singularity of his behaviour at length forcibly arrested my attention after licking my face and hands for some minutes he would suddenly cease doing so and utter a low whine upon reaching out my hand towards him i then invariably found him lying on his back with his paws uplifted this conduct so frequently repeated appeared strange and i could in no manner account for it as the dog seemed distressed i concluded that he had received some injury and taking his paws in my hands i examined them one by one but found no sign of any hurt i then supposed him hungry and gave him a large piece of ham which he devoured with avidity fterward however resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres i now imagined that he was suffering like myself the torments of thirst and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one when the idea occurred to me that i had as yet only examined his paws and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head the latter i felt carefully over but found nothing on passing my hand however along his back i perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it probing this with my finger i discovered a string and tracing it up found that it encircled the whole body upon a closer scrutiny i came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal chapter the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from augustus and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon he had devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of affairs trembling with eagerness i now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers i had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep and indeed previously to my last journey to the trap i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had deposited them but now i endeavoured in vain to call it to mind and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles never surely was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense at length while groping about with my head close to the ballast near the opening of the box and outside of it i perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage greatly surprised i endeavoured to make my way towards it as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position scarcely had i moved with this intention when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely and before i could bring it into view again was obliged to feel along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original situation now moving my head with caution to and fro i found that by proceeding slowly with great care in an opposite direction to that in which i had at first started i was enabled to draw near the light still keeping it in view presently i came directly upon it having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow winding and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side i was wondering how they came in such a place when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taperax which had been evidently mumbled by the dog i concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles and i felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of augustus the small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel that i despaired of deriving any service from them and left them as they were the phosphorus of which there was only a speck or two i gathered up as well as i could and returned with it after much difficulty to my box where tiger had all the while remained what to do next i could not tell the hold was so intensely dark that i could not see my hand however close i would hold it to my face the white slip of paper could barely be discerned and not even that when i looked at it directly by turning the exterior portions of the retina towards it that is to say by surveying it slightly askance i found that it became in some measure perceptible thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined and the note of my friend if indeed it were a note from him seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind in vain i revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for procuring light uch expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose ach and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker alternately one above the other at last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational and which gave me cause to wonder very justly that i had not entertained it before i placed the slip of paper on the back of a book and collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from the barrel laid them together upon the paper i then with the palm of my hand rubbed the whole over quickly yet steadily a clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface and had there been any writing upon it i should not have experienced the least difficulty i am sure in reading it not a syllable was there however othing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank the illumination died away in a few seconds and my heart died away within me as it went i have before stated more than once that my intellect for some period prior to this had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy there were to be sure momentary intervals of perfect sanity and now and then even of energy but these were few it must be remembered that i had been for many days certainly inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel and a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had none or had i slept during that time salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief and indeed since the loss of the mutton my only supply of food with the exception of the seaiscuit and these latter were utterly useless to me as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat i was now in a high state of fever and in every respect exceedingly ill this will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus before the thought suggested itself that i had examined only one side of the paper i shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage for i believe i was more angry than anything els when the egregious oversight i had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception the blunder itself would have been unimportant had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise n my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip i had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away it was impossible to say where from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the sagacity of tiger having got after a long search a small piece of the note i put it to the dog nose and endeavoured to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it to my astonishment for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famou he seemed to enter at once into my meaning and rummaging about for a few moments soon found another considerable portion bringing me this he paused a while and rubbing his nose against my hand appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done i patted him on the head when he immediately made off again it was now some minutes before he came back ut when he did come he brought with him a large slip which proved to be all the paper missing t having been torn it seems only into three pieces luckily i had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left eing guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do it was very probable i considered that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined ut which side was that fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect although it assured me that the words if there were an would be found all on one side and connected in a proper manner as written there was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt should i fail in the one i was now about to make i placed the paper on a book as before and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind at last i thought it barely possible that the written side might have some unevenness on its surface which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect i determined to make the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself othing however was perceptible and i turned the paper adjusting it on the book i now again carried my forefinger cautiously along when i was aware of an exceedingly slight but still discernible glow which followed as it proceeded this i knew must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered the paper in my previous attempt the other or under side then was that on which lay the writing if writing there should finally prove to be again i turned the note and went to work as i had previously done having rubbed in the phosphorus a brilliancy ensued as before ut this time several lines of ms in a large hand and apparently in red ink became distinctly visible the glimmer although sufficiently bright was but momentary still had i not been too greatly excited there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me or i saw there were three in my anxiety however to read all at once i succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words which thus appeared blood our life depends upon lying close had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note he full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey that admonition even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable could not i am firmly convinced have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received and blood too that word of all words o rife at all times with mystery and suffering and terror ow trebly full of import did it now appear ow chillily and heavily disjointed as it thus was from any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinc did its vague syllables fall amid the deep gloom of my prison into the innermost recesses of my soul augustus had undoubtedly good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be ut i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery just after returning from my last journey to the trap and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of tiger i had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board or if i could not succeed in this directly of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck the half certainty which i felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency had given me courage which i should not otherwise have ha to endure the evils of my situation the few words i had been able to read however had cut me off from these final resources and i now for the first time felt all the misery of my fate in a paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress where for about the period of a day and night i lay in a kind of stupor relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection at length i once more arose and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me for another twentyour hours it was barely possible that i might exist without water or a longer time i could not do so during the first portion of my imprisonment i had made free use of the cordials with which augustus had supplied me but they only served to excite fever without in the least degree assuaging my thirst i had now only about a gill left and this was of a species of strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted the sausages were entirely consumed of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin and all the biscuit except a few fragments of one had been eaten by tiger to add to my troubles i found that my headache was increasing momentarily and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep for some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty i could breathe at all and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most distressing spasmodic action of the chest but there was still another and very different source of disquietude and one indeed whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress it arose from the demeanour of the dog i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt as i rubbed he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl but i was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance soon afterward it will be remembered i threw myself on the mattress and fell into a species of lethargy presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears and discovered it to proceed from tiger who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom i spoke to him when he replied with a low growl and then remained quiet presently i relapsed into my stupor from which i was again awakened in a similar manner this was repeated three or four times until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear that i became fully aroused he was now lying close by the door of the box snarling fearfully although in a kind of under tone and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad and i was at a loss what course to pursue i could not endure the thought of killing him yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity and i expected every instant that he would attack me at last i could endure my terrible situation no longer and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards and despatch him if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so to get out i had to pass directly over his body and he already seemed to anticipate my design aising himself upon his fore legs as i perceived by the altered position of his eye and displaying the whole of his white fangs which were easily discernible i took the remains of the hamkin and the bottle containing the liqueur and secured them about my person together with a large carvingnife which augustus had left me hen folding my cloak as closely around me as possible i made a movement towards the mouth of the box no sooner did i do this than the dog sprang with a loud growl towards my throat the whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder and i fell violently to the left while the enraged animal passed entirely over me i had fallen upon my knees with my head buried among the blankets and these protected me from a second furious assault during which i felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck et luckily without being able to penetrate all the folds i was now beneath the dog and a few moments would place me completely in his power despair gave me strength and i rose bodily up shaking him from me by main force and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress these i now threw over him and before he could extricate himself i had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit in this struggle however i had been forced to drop the morsel of hamkin and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur as this reflection crossed my mind i felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances and raising the bottle to my lips i drained it to the last drop and dashed it furiously upon the floor scarcely had the echo of the crash died away when i heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice issuing from the direction of the steerage so unexpected was anything of the kind and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound that i endeavoured in vain to reply my powers of speech totally failed and in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead and return without attempting to reach me i stood up between the crates near the door of the box trembling convulsively and gasping and struggling for utterance had a thousand worlds depended upon a syllable i could not have spoken it there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station the sound presently grew less distinct then again less so and still less shall i ever forget my feelings at this moment he was going y friend y companion from whom i had a right to expect so much e was going e would abandon me e was gone he would leave me to perish miserably to expire in the most horrible and loathsome of dungeons nd one word ne little syllable would save me et that single syllable i could not utter i felt i am sure more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself my brain reeled and i fell deadly sick against the end of the box as i fell the carvingnife was shaken out from the waistband of my pantaloons and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears with the intensest anxiety i listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon augustus or i knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself all was silent for some moments at length i again heard the word arthur repeated in a low tone and one full of hesitation reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech and i now screamed at the top of my voice augustus oh augustus hush or god sake be silent he replied in a voice trembling with agitation i will be with you immediately s soon as i can make my way through the hold for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber and every moment seemed to me an age at length i felt his hand upon my shoulder and he placed at the same moment a bottle of water to my lips those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst augustus produced from his pocket three or four cold boiled potatoes which i devoured with the greatest avidity he had brought with him a light in a dark lantern and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink but i was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my incarceration chapter the brig put to sea as i had supposed in about an hour after he had left the watch this was on the twentieth of june it will be remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days and during this period there was so constant a bustle on board and so much running to and fro especially in the cabin and staterooms that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered when at length he did come i had assured him that i was doing as well as possible and therefore for the two next days he felt but little uneasiness on my account till however watching an opportunity of going down it was not until the fourth day that he found one several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure and have me come up at once but we were still within reaching distance of nantucket and it was doubtful from some expressions which had escaped captain barnard whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board besides upon thinking the matter over augustus so he told me could not imagine that i was in immediate want or that i would hesitate in such case to make myself heard at the trap when therefore he considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved this as i said before did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch and the seventh since i had first entered the hold he then went down without taking with him any water or provisions intending in the first place merely to call my attention and get me to come from the box to the trap hen he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a supply when he descended for this purpose he found that i was asleep for it seems that i was snoring very loudly from all the calculations i can make on the subject this must have been the slumber into which i fell just after my return from the trap with the watch and which consequently must have lasted for more than three entire days and nights at the very least latterly i have had reason both from my own experience and the assurance of others to be acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench arising from old fishil when closely confined and when i think of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all after once falling asleep than that i should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap ut i made him no reply he then shut the trap and spoke to me in a louder and finally in a very loud tone till i continued to snore he was now at a loss what to do it would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box and in the mean while his absence would be noticed by captain barnard who had occasion for his services every minute in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage he determined therefore upon reflection to ascend and await another opportunity of visiting me he was the more easily induced to this resolve as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature and he could not suppose that i had undergone any inconvenience from my incarceration he had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible closed it and threw open the door of his stateroom no sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face and he was knocked down at the same moment by a blow from a handspike a strong hand held him on the cabin floor with a tight grasp upon his throat till he was able to see what was going on around him his father was tied hand and foot and lying along the steps of the companionay with his head down and a deep wound in the forehead from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream he spoke not a word and was apparently dying over him stood the first mate eying him with an expression of fiendish derision and deliberately searching his pockets from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer seven of the crew among whom was the cook a negr were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition besides augustus and captain barnard there were nine men altogether in the cabin and these among the most ruffianly of the brig company the villains now went upon deck taking my friend with them after having secured his arms behind his back they proceeded straight to the forecastle which was fastened down wo of the mutineers standing by it with axes wo also at the main hatch the mate called out in a loud voice do you hear there below tumble up with you ne by one now mark that nd no grumbling it was some minutes before any one appeared at last an englishman who had shipped as a raw hand came up weeping piteously and entreating the mate in the most humble manner to spare his life the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child and tossed him deliberately into the sea hearing the blow and the plunge of the body the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises until a proposition was made to smoke them out a general rush then ensued and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken the mutineers however succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up these six finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms submitted after a brief struggle the mate gave them fair words o doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck the result proved his sagacity no less than his diabolical villany all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting and ascending one by one were pinioned and thrown on their backs together with the first six here being in all of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny twentyeven a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued the bound seamen were dragged to the gangway here the cook stood with an axe striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers in this manner twentywo perished and augustus had given himself up for lost expecting every moment his own turn to come next but it seemed that the villains were now either weary or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour for the four remaining prisoners together with my friend who had been thrown on the deck with the rest were respited while the mate sent below for rum and the whole murderous party held a drunken carouse which lasted until sunset they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivers who lay not more than four paces off and could distinguish every word said upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect for several voices were heard in favour of releasing the captives altogether on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits the black cook however who in all respects was a perfect demon and who seemed to exert as much influence if not more than the mate himsel would listen to no proposition of the kind and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party among whom was a lineanager who went by the name of dirk peters this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of upsarokas who live among the fastnesses of the black hills near the source of the missouri his father was a furrader i believe or at least connected in some manner with the indian tradingosts on lewis river peters himself was one of the most purely ferociousooking men i ever beheld he was short in stature ot more than four feet eight inches high ut his limbs were of the most herculean mould his hands especially were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape his arms as well as legs were bowed in the most singular manner and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever his head was equally deformed being of immense size with an indentation on the crown like that on the head of most negroe and entirely bald to conceal this latter deficiency which did not proceed from old age he usually wore a wig formed of any hairike material which presented itself the skin of a spanish dog or american grizzly bear at the time spoken of he had on a portion of one of these bearskins and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance which betook of the upsaroka character the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear the lips were thin and seemed like some other portions of his frame to be devoid of natural pliancy so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever this ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding and never even partially covered in any instance by the lips to pass this man with a casual glance one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter ut a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment that if such an expression were indicative of merriment the merriment must be that of a demon of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring men of nantucket these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity but on board the grampus it seems he was regarded at the time of the mutiny with feelings more of derision than of anything else i have been thus particular in speaking of dirk peters because ferocious as he appeared he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of augustus and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative narrative let me here say which in its latter portions will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining credence for all that i shall tell yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels it was determined at last that all the prisoners with the exception of augustus whom peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his cler should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain barnard was still living or it will be remembered he was left below when the mutineers came up presently the two made their appearance the captain pale as death but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound he spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate entreated them not to set him adrift but to return to their duty and promising to land them wherever they chose and to take no steps for bringing them to justice he might as well have spoken to the winds two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig side into the boat which had been lowered while the mate went below the four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow which they did without attempting any resistance ugustus being still left in his painful position although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell a handful of seaiscuit and a jug of water were now handed down but neither mast sail oar nor compass the boat was towed astern for a few minutes during which the mutineers held another consultation t was then finally cut adrift by this time night had come on here were neither moon nor stars visible nd a short and ugly sea was running although there was no great deal of wind the boat was instantly out of sight and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it this event happened however in latitude north longitude west and consequently at no very great distance from the bermuda islands augustus therefore endeavoured to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels off the coast all sail was now put upon the brig and she continued her original course to the southwest he mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition in which from all that could be understood a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape verd islands to porto rico no attention was paid to augustus who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin companionay dirk peters treated him with some degree of kindness and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook his situation was still one of the most precarious as the men were continually intoxicated and there was no relying upon their continued goodumour or carelessness in regard to himself his anxiety on my account he represented however as the most distressing result of his condition and indeed i had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship more than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board but was restrained from so doing partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld and partly through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief for the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch but in spite of the most constant vigilance three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred at length on the night of the third day there came on a heavy blow from the eastward and all hands were called up to take in sail during the confusion which ensued he made his way below unobserved and into the stateroom what was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposite for a variety of seatores and shipurniture and that several fathoms of old chainable which had been stowed away beneath the companionadder had been dragged thence to make room for a chest and were now lying immediately upon the trap to remove it without discovery was impossible and he returned on deck as quickly as he could as he came up the mate seized him by the throat and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark when his life was again preserved through the interference of dirk peters augustus was now put in handcuffs of which there were several pairs on boar and his feet lashed tightly together he was then taken into the steerage and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again until the brig was no longer a brig this was the expression of the cook who threw him into the berth t is hardly possible to say what precise meaning was intended by the phrase the whole affair however proved the ultimate means of my relief as will presently appear chapter for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle augustus abandoned himself to despair never hoping to leave the berth alive he now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who should come down with my situation thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold or it had been ten days since i was first imprisoned and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four as he was thinking on this subject the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold in any other circumstances the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented him from attempting it but now he had at all events little prospect of life and consequently little to lose e bent his whole mind therefore upon the task his handcuffs were the first consideration at first he saw no method of removing them and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure with very little effort or inconvenience merely by squeezing his hands through them his species of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure he now untied his feet and leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be readjusted in the event of any person coming down proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth the partition here was of soft pine board an inch thick and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through a voice was now heard at the forecastle companionay and he had just time to put his right hand into its handcuff the left had not been remove and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his ankle when dirk peters came below followed by tiger who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down the dog had been brought on board by augustus who knew my attachment to the animal and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage he went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch since the mutiny augustus had not seen him before his appearance with dirk peters and had given him up for lost supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate gang it appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a whaleboat from which not having room to turn round he could not extricate himself peters at last let him out and with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes with a can of water he then went on deck promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day when he had gone augustus freed both hands from the manacles and unfastened his feet he then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying and with his penknife for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search hi commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks as closely as possible to the floor of the berth he chose to cut here because if suddenly interrupted he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position for the remainder of the day however no disturbance occurred and by night he had completely divided the plank it should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a sleepinglace living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny drinking the wines and feasting on the sea stores of captain barnard and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig these circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and augustus for had matters been otherwise he would have found it impossible to reach me as it was he proceeded with confidence in his design it was near daybreak however before he completed the second division of the board which was about a foot above the first cu thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main orlop deck having got here he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of oilasks piled nearly as high as the upper deck there being barely room enough left for his body upon reaching the hatch he found that tiger had followed him below squeezing between two rows of the casks it was now too late however to attempt getting to me before dawn as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold he therefore resolved to return and wait till the next night with this design he proceeded to loosen the hatch so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again no sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced snuffed for a moment and then uttered a long whine scratching at the same time as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws there could be no doubt from his behaviour that he was aware of my being in the hold and augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down he now hit upon the expedient of sending the note as it was especially desirable that i should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended after events proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did for had it not been for the receipt of the note i should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan however desperate of alarming the crew and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence having concluded to write the difficulty was now to procure the materials for so doing an old toothpick was soon made into a pen and this by means of feeling altogether for the betweenecks were as dark as pitch paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter duplicate of the forged letter from mr ross this had been the original draught but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated augustus had written another thrusting the first by good fortune into his coatocket where it was now most opportunely discovered ink alone was thus wanting and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight incision with the penknife on the back of a finger just above the nail copious flow of blood ensuing as usual from wounds in that vicinity the note was now written as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place that captain barnard was set adrift and that i might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned but must not venture upon making any disturbance it concluded with these words i have scrawled this with blood our life depends upon lying close the slip of paper being tied upon the dog he was now put down the hatchway and augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence to conceal the hole in the partition he drove his knife in just above it and hung up a peaacket which he found in the berth his handcuffs were then replaced and also the rope around his ankles these arrangements were scarcely completed when dirk peters came below very drunk but in excellent humour and bringing with him my friend allowance of provision for the day this consisted of a dozen large irish potatoes roasted and a pitcher of water he sat for some time on a chest by the berth and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of the brig his demeanour was exceedingly capricious and even grotesque at one time augustus was much alarmed by his odd conduct at last however he went on deck muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow during the day two of the crew harpooner came down accompanied by the cook all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication like peters they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans it appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course agreeing in no point except the attack on the ship from the cape verd islands with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting as far as could be ascertained the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty a private pique of the chief mate against captain barnard having been the main instigation there now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew ne headed by the mate the other by the cook the former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself and equipping it at some of the west india islands for a piratical cruise the latter division however which was the stronger and included dirk peters among its partisans were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the south pacific there either to take whale or act otherwise as circumstances should suggest the representations of peters who had frequently visited these regions had great weight apparently with the mutineers wavering as they were between halfngendered notions of profit and pleasure he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed but more particularly on the deliciousness of the climate on the abundant means of good living and on the voluptuous beauty of the women as yet nothing had been absolutely determined upon but the pictures of the hybrid lineanager were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen and there was every probability that his intentions would be finally carried into effect the three men went away in about an hour and no one else entered the forecastle all day augustus lay quiet until nearly night he then freed himself from the rope and irons and prepared for his attempt a bottle was found in one of the berths and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by peters storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes to his great joy he also came across a lantern with a small piece of tallow candle in it this he could light at any moment as he had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches when it was quite dark he got through the hole in the bulkhead having taken the precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up when through he hung up the peaacket on his knife as before to conceal the aperture his manoeuvre being easily effected as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out until afterward he was now on the main orlop deck and proceeded to make his way as before between the upper deck and the oilasks to the main hatchway having reached this he lit the piece of candle and descended groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold in a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the closeness of the atmosphere he could not think it possible that i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air he called my name repeatedly but i made him no reply and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed the brig was rolling violently and there was so much noise in consequence that it was useless to listen for any weak sound such as those of my breathing or snoring he threw open the lantern and held it as high as possible whenever an opportunity occurred in order that by observing the light i might if alive be aware that succour was approaching still nothing was heard from me and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty he determined nevertheless to force a passage if possible to the box and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises he pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety until at length he found the pathway utterly blocked up and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out overcome now by his feelings he threw himself among the lumber in despair and wept like a child it was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down fortunate indeed was it that the incident occurred or upon this incident trivial as it appears the thread of my destiny depended many years elapsed however before i was aware of this fact a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me and return at once to the forecastle before condemning him entirely on this head the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration the night was fast wearing away and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered and indeed would necessarily be so if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak his candle was expiring in the socket and there would be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark it must be allowed too that he had every good reason to believe me dead in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself he had repeatedly called and i had made him no answer i had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me a supply which it was not at all probable i had hoarded in the beginning of my confinement as i had had every cause to expect a speedy release the atmosphere of the hold too must have appeared to him coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage of a nature absolutely poisonous and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box he hatchways at that time having been constantly open for many months previous add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend his confinement privations and narrow escapes from death together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed ircumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind nd the reader will be easily brought as i have been to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard yet augustus was not sure that it proceeded from the hold the doubt however was sufficient inducement to persevere he clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by means of the stowage and then watching for a lull in the pitchings of the vessel he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command egardless for the moment of the danger of being overheard by the crew it will be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me but i was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply confident now that his worst apprehensions were well founded he descended with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time in his haste some small boxes were thrown down the noise occasioned by which i heard as will be recollected he had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate he retraced his steps immediately and clambering up the stowage a second time called out my name loudly as before having watched for a lull this time i found voice to answer overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in he at length struck into an opening which promised better and finally after a series of struggles arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion chapter the leading particulars of this narration were all that augustus communicated to me while we remained near the box it was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details he was apprehensive of being missed and i was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement we resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead near which i was to remain for the present while he went through to reconnoitre to leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of yet how to act otherwise was the question he now seemed to be perfectly quiet and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box i was convinced that he was dead and determined to open the door we found him lying at full length apparently in a deep stupor yet still alive no time was to be lost yet i could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life without some attempt at preserving him we therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue augustus during part of the time being forced to clamber over the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate at length we succeeded in reaching the hole when augustus got through and tiger was pushed in afterward all was found to be safe and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped for the present it was agreed that i should remain near the opening through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision and where i could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure in explanation of some portions of this narrative wherein i have spoken of the stowage of the brig and which may appear ambiguous to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage i must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been performed on board the grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand a proper stowage cannot be accomplished in a careless manner and many most disastrous accidents even within the limits of my own experience have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular coasting vessels in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage the great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent rollings of the vessel with this end great attention must be paid not only to the bulk taken in but to the nature of the bulk and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo in most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw thus in a load of tobacco or flour the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or hogsheads upon discharging are found to be completely flattened and take some time to regain their original shape this screwing however is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco there can be no danger of any shifting whatever at least none from which inconvenience can result there have been instances indeed where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo a load of cotton for example tightly screwed while in certain conditions has been known through the expansion of its bulk to rend a vessel asunder at sea there can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco while undergoing its usual course of fermentation were it not for the interstices consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune only those who have encountered a violent gale of wind or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the gale can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel it is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage when there is a partial cargo becomes obvious when lying to especially with a small head sai a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her beamnds this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average yet without any serious consequences resulting provided there be a proper stowage if this however has not been strictly attended to in the first of these heavy lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water and being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium as she would otherwise necessarily do she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down it is not too much to say that at least one half of the instances in which vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board the whole after being first stowed as compactly as may be should be covered with a layer of stout shiftingoards extending completely across the vessel upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected reaching to the timbers above and thus securing everything in its place in cargoes consisting of grain or any similar matter additional precautions are requisite a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon leaching its destination his too although the freight when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee will overrun by a vast deal on account of the swelling of the grai the quantity consigned this result is occasioned by settling during the voyage and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced if grain loosely thrown in a vessel then is ever so well secured by shiftingoards and stanchions it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities to prevent these every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible and for this there are many contrivances among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain even after all this is done and unusual pains taken to secure the shiftingoards no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo of grain on board and least of all with a partial cargo yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels and it is likely many more from the ports of europe which sail daily with partial cargoes even of the most dangerous species and without any precautions whatever the wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen a lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain joel rice of the schooner firefly which sailed from richmond virginia to madeira with a cargo of corn in the year the captain had gone many voyages without serious accident although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage more than to secure it in the ordinary manner he had never before sailed with a cargo of grain and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely when it did not much more than half fill the vessel for the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes but when within a day sail of madeira there came on a strong gale from the n n e which forced him to lie to he brought the schooner to the wind under a doubleeefed foresail alone when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do and shipped not a drop of water towards night the gale somewhat abated and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before but still did very well until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beamnds to starboard the corn was then heard to shift bodily the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway the vessel went down like a shot this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira which picked up one of the crew the only person save and which rode out the gale in perfect security as indeed a jollyboat might have done under proper management the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous huddling together of oilasks and ship furniture i have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold on the orlop deck there was space enough for my body as i have state between the oilasks and the upper deck a space was left open around the main hatchway and several other large spaces were left in the stowage near the hole cut through the bulkhead by augustus there was room enough for an entire cask and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for the present footnote whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oilanks hy the grampus was not i have never been able to ascertain by the time my friend had got safely into the berth and readjusted his handcuffs and the rope it was broad daylight we had made a narrow escape indeed for scarcely had he arranged all matters when the mate came below with dirk peters and the cook they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape verds and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance at length the cook came to the berth in which augustus was lying and seated himself in it near the head i could see and hear everything from my hidinglace for the piece cut out had not been put back and i was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the peaacket which was hung up to conceal the aperture in which case all would have been discovered and our lives would no doubt have been instantly sacrificed our good fortune prevailed however and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery the bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side all this time tiger was lying in the foot of the berth and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties for i could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath after a few minutes the mate and cook went above leaving dirk peters behind who as soon as they were gone came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate he began to talk very sociably with augustus and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication while the two others were with him was a feint he answered all my companion questions with perfect freedom told him that he had no doubt of his father having been picked up as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift and used other language of a consolatory nature which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure indeed i began to entertain hopes that through the instrumentality of peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig and this idea i mentioned to augustus as soon as i found an opportunity he thought the matter possible but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most arbitrary caprice alone and indeed it was difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind peters went upon deck in about an hour and did not return again until noon when he brought augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding of this when we were left alone i partook heartily without returning through the hole no one else came down into the forecastle during the day and at night i got into augustus berth where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck and i regained my hidinglace as quickly as possible when the day was fully broke we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely and gave no indications of hydrophobia drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite his strange conduct had been brought on no doubt by the deleterious quality of the air of the hold and had no connexion with canine madness i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had persisted in bringing him with me from the box this day was the thirtieth of june and the thirteenth since the grampus made sail from nantucket on the second of july the mate came below drunk as usual and in an excessively goodumour he came to augustus berth and giving him a slap on the back asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again to this of course my friend answered in the affirmative when the ruffian set him at liberty after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coatocket both now went on deck and i did not see augustus for about three hours he then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast and that he had been ordered to sleep as usual in the forecastle he brought me too a good dinner and a plentiful supply of water the brig was still cruising for the vessel from the cape verds and a sail was now in sight which was thought to be the one in question as the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative i will here throw them into the form of a journal as i do not wish to omit them altogether july augustus furnished me with three blankets with which i contrived a comfortable bed in my hidinglace no one came below except my companion during the day tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture and slept heavily as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness towards night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in and very nearly capsized her the puff died away immediately however and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the foretopsail dirk peters treated augustus all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the pacific ocean and the islands he had visited in that region he asked him whether he would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate views to this augustus thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure since nothing better could be done and that anything was preferable to a piratical life july th the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from liverpool and was allowed to pass unmolested augustus spent most of his time on deck with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers they had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves in one of which a harpooner jim bonner was thrown overboard the party of the mate was gaining ground jim bonner belonged to the cook gang of which peters was a partisan july th about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west which at noon freshened into a gale so that the brig could carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail in taking in the foretopsail simms one of the common hands and belonging also to the cook gang fell overboard being very much in liquor and was drowned o attempt being made to save him the whole number of persons on board was now thirteen to wit dirk peters seymour the black cook jones greely hartman rogers and william allen of the cook party the mate whose name i never learned absalom hicks wilson john hunt and richard parker of the mate party esides augustus and myself july th the gale lasted all this day blowing in heavy squalls accompanied with rain the brig took in a good deal of water through her seams and one of the pumps was kept continually going augustus being forced to take his turn just at twilight a large ship passed close by us without having been discovered until within hail this ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookut the mate hailed her but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale at eleven a sea was shipped amidhips which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks and did some other slight damage towards morning the weather moderated and at sunrise there was very little wind july th there was a heavy swell running all this day during which the brig being light rolled excessively and many articles broke loose in the hold as i could hear distinctly from my hidinglace i suffered a great deal from seaickness peters had a long conversation this day with augustus and told him that two of his gang greely and allen had gone over to the mate and were resolved to turn pirates he put several questions to augustus which he did not then exactly understand during a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel and little could be done to remedy it as it was occasioned by the brig straining and taking in the water through her seams a sail was thrummed and got under the bows which aided us in some measure so that we began to gain upon the leak july th a light breeze sprung up at sunrise from the eastward when the mate headed the brig to the southwest with the intention of making some of the west india islands in pursuance of his piratical designs no opposition was made by peters or the cook at least none in the hearing of augustus all idea of taking the vessel from the cape verds was abandoned the leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour the sail was drawn from beneath the bows spoke two small schooners during the day july th fine weather all hands employed in repairing bulwarks peters had again a long conversation with augustus and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore he said nothing should induce him to come into the mate views and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands he asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case to which augustus said yes without hesitation peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject and went away during the remainder of the day augustus had no opportunity of speaking with him privately chapter july spoke a brig from rio bound to norfolk weather hazy with a light baffling wind from the eastward toay hartman rogers died having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of grog this man was of the cook party and one upon whom peters placed his main reliance he told augustus that he believed the mate had poisoned him and that he expected if he did not be on the lookut his own turn would come shortly there were now only himself jones and the cook belonging to his own gang n the other side there were five he had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate but the project having been coolly received he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further or from saying anything to the cook it was well as it happened that he was so prudent for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate and went over formally to that party while jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation there was now evidently no time to be lost and peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards provided augustus would lend him his aid my friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose and thinking the opportunity a favourable one made known the fact of my being on board at this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted as he had no reliance whatever upon jones whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate they went below immediately when augustus called to me by name and peters and myself were soon made acquainted it was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the first good opportunity leaving jones altogether out of our councils in the event of success we were to run the brig into the first port that offered and deliver her up the desertion of his party had frustrated peters design of going into the pacific n adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial on the score of insanity which he solemnly averred had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutin or upon obtaining a pardon if found guilty through the representations of augustus and myself our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of all hands take in sail and peters and augustus ran up on deck as usual the crew were nearly all drunk and before sail could be properly taken in a violent squall laid the brig on her beamnds by keeping her away however she righted having shipped a good deal of water scarcely was everything secure when another squall took the vessel and immediately afterward another o damage being done there was every appearance of a gale of wind which indeed shortly came on with great fury from the northward and westward all was made as snug as possible and we laid to as usual under a closeeefed foresail as night drew on the wind increased in violence with a remarkably heavy sea peters now came into the forecastle with augustus and we resumed our deliberations we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our design into effect as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated as the brig was snugly laid to there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather when if we succeeded in our attempt we might liberate one or perhaps two of the men to aid us in taking her into port the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces there were only three of us and in the cabin there were nine all the arms on board too were in their possession with the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had concealed about his person and the large seaman knife which he always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons from certain indications too such for example as there being no such thing as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions at least in regard to peters and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him it was clear indeed that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution peters proposed that he should go up on deck and enter into conversation with the watch alle when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble and without making any disturbance by seizing a good opportunity that augustus and myself should then come up and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck and that we should then make a rush together and secure the companionay before any opposition could be offered i objected to this because i could not believe that the mate who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudice would suffer himself to be so easily entrapped the very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert t not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced to station a watch on deck when a vessel is lying to in a gale of wind as i address myself principally if not altogether to persons who have never been to sea it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances lying to or in seaarlance laying to is a measure resorted to for various purposes and effected in various manners in moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a standtill to wait for another vessel or any similar object if the vessel which lies to is under full sail the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails so as to let the wind take them aback when she becomes stationary but we are now speaking of lying to in a gale of wind this is done when the wind is ahead and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of capsizing and sometimes even when the wind is fair but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward this manoeuvre then is seldom resorted to in such case unless through necessity when the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas for when lying to her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining and it is not so much the case when scudding often too it becomes necessary to scud a vessel either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind or when through the false modelling of the frame or other causes this main object cannot be effected vessels in a gale of wind are laid to in different manners according to their peculiar construction some lie to best under a foresail and this i believe is the sail most usually employed large squareigged vessels have sails for the express purpose called stormtaysails but the jib is occasionally employed by itself ometimes the jib and foresail or a doubleeefed foresail and not unfrequently the afterails are made use of foretopsails are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail the grampus was generally laid to under a closeeefed foresail when a vessel is to be laid to her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft that is when brought diagonally across the vessel this being done the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves in this situation a good vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a drop of water and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew the helm is usually lashed down but this is altogether unnecessary except on account of the noise it makes when loos for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when lying to indeed the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play as long as the sail holds a wellodelled vessel will maintain her situation and ride every sea as if instinct with life and reason if the violence of the wind however should tear the sail into pieces a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstance there is then imminent danger the vessel falls off from the wind and coming broadside to the sea is completely at its mercy the only resource in this case is to put her quickly before the wind letting her scud until some other sail can be set some vessels will lie to under no sail whatever but such are not to be trusted at sea but to return from this digression it had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying to in a gale of wind and the fact that he had now one coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner peters had suggested something however was to be done and that with as little delay as practicable for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against peters he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the gale augustus now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove under any pretext the piece of chainable which lay over the trap in the stateroom we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate it will be remembered that one of the crew hartman rogers had died during the morning having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate and for this belief he had reasons so he said which were incontrovertible but which he could not be prevailed upon to explain to us his wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character but whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion and determined to act accordingly rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon in violent convulsions and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever remember to have seen the stomach was swollen immensely like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks the hands were in the same condition while the face was shrunken shrivelled and of a chalky whiteness except where relieved by two or three glaring red splotches like those occasioned by the erysipelas one of these splotches extended diagonally across the face completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red velvet in this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard when the mate getting a glimpse of it for he now saw it for the first tim and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock and allow it the usual rites of seaurial having given these directions he went below as if to avoid any further sight of his victim while preparations were making to obey his orders the gale came on with great fury and the design was abandoned for the present the corpse left to itself was washed into the larboard scuppers where it still lay at the time of which i speak floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig having arranged our plan we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible peters went upon deck and as he had anticipated was immediately accosted by allen who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose the fate of this villain however was speedily and silently decided for peters approaching him in a careless manner as if about to address him seized him by the throat and before he could utter a single cry tossed him over the bulwarks he then called to us and we came up our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves and in doing this we had to proceed with great care for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward it was indispensable too that we should be quick in our operations for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast after searching about for some time we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pumpandles one of which augustus took and i the other having secured these we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard peters and myself then went below leaving augustus to watch upon deck where he took his station just where allen had been placed and with his back to the cabin companionay so that if any one of the mate gang should come up he might suppose it was the watch as soon as i got below i commenced disguising myself so as to represent the corpse of rogers the shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much for it was of a singular form and character and easily recognisable kind of smock which the deceased wore over his other clothing it was a blue stockinett with large white stripes running across having put this on i proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse this was soon effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes i then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen mittens and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves peters then arranged my face first rubbing it well over with white chalk and afterward splotching it with blood which he took from a cut in his finger the streak across the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking appearance chapter as i viewed myself in a fragment of lookinglass which hung up in the cabin and by the dim light of a kind of battleantern i was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance and at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus representing that i was seized with a violent tremour and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part it was necessary however to act with decision and peters and myself went upon deck we there found everything safe and keeping close to the bulwarks the three of us crept to the cabin companionay it was only partially closed precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting we found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed it now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise for they were evidently on the alert only one was asleep and he lying just at the foot of the companionadder with a musket by his side the rest were seated on several mattresses which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor they were engaged in earnest conversation and although they had been carousing as appeared from two empty jugs with some tin tumblers which lay about they were not as much intoxicated as usual all had knives one or two of them pistols and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand we listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act having as yet resolved on nothing determinate except that we would attempt to paralyze their exertions when we should attack them by means of the apparition of rogers they were discussing their piratical plans in which all we could hear distinctly was that they would unite with the crew of a schooner hornet and if possible get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us one of the men spoke of peters when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished and afterward added more loudly that he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain brat in the forecastle and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better to this no answer was made but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party and more particularly by jones at this period i was excessively agitated the more so as i could see that neither augustus nor peters could determine how to act i made up my mind however to sell my life as dearly as possible and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging and the washing of the sea over the deck prevented us from hearing what was said except during momentary lulls in one of these we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to go forward and order the lubbers to come into the cabin where he could have an eye upon them for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig it was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution the cook got up from his mattress to go for us when a tremendous lurch which i thought would carry away the masts threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors bursting it open and creating a good deal of other confusion luckily neither of our party was thrown from his position and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance or rather before he put his head out of the companionatch for he did not come on deck from this station he could not notice the absence of allen and he accordingly bawled out as if to him repeating the orders of the mate peters cried out ay ay in a disguised voice and the cook immediately went below without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it the mate received them with feigned cordiality and told augustus that since he had behaved himself so well of late he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum and made him drink it all this i saw and heard for i followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut and took up my old point of observation i had brought with me the two pumpandles one of which i secured near the companionay to be ready for use when required i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters should make a signal to me as agreed upon presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen i could not make out all that was said but i could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present the mate was evidently much agitated and presently when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers corpse i thought he was upon the point of swooning peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers at this the villain absolutely gasped for breath and turned his head slowly round upon his companions as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task no one however stirred and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement peters now made me the signal i immediately threw open the door of the companionay and descending without uttering a syllable stood erect in the midst of the party the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration usually in cases of a similar nature there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes a degree of hope however feeble that he is the victim of chicanery and that the apparition is not actually a visitant from the world of shadows it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about is to be attributed even in the cases most in point and where most suffering has been experienced more to a kind of anticipative horror lest the apparition might possibly be real than to an unwavering belief in its reality but in the present instance it will be seen immediately that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification of his disgusting corpse or at least its spiritual image the isolated situation of the brig with its entire inaccessibility on account of the gale confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance they had now been at sea twentyour days without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever the whole of the crew too at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board were assembled in the cabin with the exception of allen the watch and his gigantic stature he was six feet six inches hig was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant add to these considerations the awenspiring nature of the tempest and that of the conversation brought about by peters the deep impression which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men the excellence of the imitation in my person and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me as the glare of the cabin lantern swinging violently to and fro fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated the mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying and without uttering a syllable fell back stone dead upon the cabin floor and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig of the remaining seven there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind the four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered the only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook john hunt and richard parker but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence the two former were shot instantly by peters and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pumpandle which i had brought with me in the mean time augustus seized one of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer wilso through the breast there were now but three remaining but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them for they fought with great resolution and fury and but for the immense muscular strength of peters might have ultimately got the better of us these three men were jones greely and absalom hicks jones had thrown augustus on the floor stabbed him in several places along the right arm and would no doubt have soon despatched him as neither peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonist had it not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance we surely had never depended this friend was no other than tiger with a low growl he bounded into the cabin at a most critical moment for augustus and throwing himself upon jones pinned him to the floor in an instant my friend however was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever and i was so encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little the dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of jones eters nevertheless was far more than a match for the two men who remained and would no doubt have despatched them sooner had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act and the tremendous lurches of the vessel presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool several of which lay about the floor with this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with hicks he seized him by the throat and by dint of sheer strength strangled him instantaneously thus in far less time than i have taken to tell it we found ourselves masters of the brig the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard parker this man it will be remembered i had knocked down with a blow from the pumpandle at the commencement of the attack he now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom but upon peters touching him with his foot he spoke and entreated for mercy his head was only slightly cut and otherwise he had received no injury having been merely stunned by the blow he now got up and for the present we secured his hands behind his back the dog was still growling over jones but upon examination we found him completely dead the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat inflicted no doubt by the sharp teeth of the animal it was now about one olock in the morning and the wind was still blowing tremendously the brig evidently laboured much more than usual and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of easing her in some measure at almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle the hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended the entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away as well as the caboose together with the jollyboat from the counter the creaking and working of the mainmast too gave indication that it was nearly sprung to make room for more stowage in the after hold the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks a very reprehensible practice occasionally resorted to by ignorant shipuilder so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step but to crown all our difficulties we plummed the well and found no less than seven feet water leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin we got to work immediately at the pumps arker of course being set at liberty to assist us in the labour augustus arm was bound up as well as we could effect it and he did what he could but that was not much however we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going as there were only four of us this was severe labour but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits and looked anxiously for daybreak when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue and when the day at length broke the gale had neither abated in the least nor were there any signs of its abating we now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard our next care was to get rid of the mainmast the necessary preparations having been made peters cut away at the mast having found axes in the cabi while the rest of us stood by the stays and lanyards as the brig gave a tremendous leeurch the word was given to cut away the weatheranyards which being done the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea clear of the brig and without doing any material injury we now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before but our situation was still exceedingly precarious and in spite of the utmost exertions we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps the little assistance which augustus could render us was not really of any importance to add to our distress a heavy sea striking the brig to windward threw her off several points from the wind and before she could regain her position another broke completely over her and hurled her full upon her beamnds the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some tim and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from capsizing presently however we partially righted but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone and were bleeding in the most horrible manner contrary to parker advice we now proceeded to cut away the foremast and at length accomplished it after much difficulty owing to the position in which we lay in going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit and left us a complete hulk so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our longboat which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board but we had not long to congratulate ourselves for the foremast having gone and of course the foresail with it by which the brig had been steadied every sea now made a complete breach over us and in five minutes our deck was swept from stem to stern the longboat and starboard bulwarks torn off and even the windlass shattered into fragments it was indeed hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale abating but in this we were sadly disappointed for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury about four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast and as the night closed in upon us i had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together until morning by midnight we had settled very deep in the water which was now up to the orlop deck the rudder went soon afterward the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore we had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last as it was unusually strong being rigged as i have never seen one rigged either before or since down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks and others in the same manner down the sternost through these hooks there extended a very thick wroughtron rod the rudder being thus held to the sternost and swinging freely on the rod the tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact that the hooks in the sternost which ran entirely through it being clinched on the inside were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever known broke right on board of us sweeping the companionay clear off bursting in the hatchways and filling every inch of the vessel with water chapter luckily just before night all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible this precaution alone saved us from destruction as it was we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted as soon as i could recover breath i called aloud to my companions augustus alone replied saying it is all over with us and may god have mercy upon our souls byndy both the others were enabled to speak when they exhorted us to take courage as there was still hope it being impossible from the nature of the cargo that the brig could go down and there being every chance that the gale would blow over by the morning these words inspired me with new life for strange as it may seem although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty oilasks would not sink i had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether and the danger which i had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering as hope revived within me i made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass and in this occupation i soon discovered that my companions were also busy the night was as dark as it could possibly be and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing our deck lay level with the sea or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam a portion of which swept over us every instant it is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of water more than one second in three although we lay close together no one of us could see the other or indeed any portion of the brig itself upon which we were so tempestuously hurled about at intervals we called one to the other thus endeavouring to keep alive hope and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it the feeble condition of augustus made him an object of solicitude with us all and as from the lacerated condition of his right arm it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard et to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question fortunately his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass the seas as they tumbled in upon him were greatly broken in their violence in any other situation than this into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spo he must inevitably have perished before morning owing to the brig lying so much along we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case the heel as i have before stated was to larboard about one half of the deck being constantly under water the seas therefore which struck us to starboard were much broken by the vessel side only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces while those which came from larboard being what are called backater seas and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us the brig was a mere log rolling about at the mercy of every wave the gale was upon the increase if anything blowing indeed a complete hurricane and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance for several hours we held on in silence expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way that the remains of the windlass would go by the board or that some of the huge seas which roared in every direction around us and above us would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface by the mercy of god however we were preserved from these imminent dangers and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind when now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before augustus spoke asking peters who lay closest to him if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved as no reply was at first made to this question we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay but presently to our great joy he spoke although very feebly saying that he was in great pain being so cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach that he must either find means of loosening them or perish as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer this occasioned us great distress as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did we exhorted him to bear his sufferings with fortitude and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him he replied that it would soon be too late that it would be all over with him before we could help him and then after moaning for some minutes lay silent when we concluded that he had perished as the evening drew on the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes and the wind had abated a great deal although still blowing a severe gale i had not heard any of my companions speak for hours and now called to augustus he replied although very feebly so that i could not distinguish what he said i then spoke to peters and to parker neither of whom returned any answer shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial insensibility during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination such as green trees waving meadows of ripe grain processions of dancing girls troops of cavalry and other phantasies i now remember that in all which passed before my mind eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on horseback carriages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession when i recovered from this state the sun was as near as i could guess an hour high i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was still in the hold of the brig near the box and that the body of parker was that of tiger when i at length completely came to my senses i found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze and that the sea was comparatively calm so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships my left arm had broken loose from its lashings and was much cut about the elbow my right was entirely benumbed and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope which had worked from the shoulder downward i was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness looking round upon my companions i saw that peters still lived although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two as i stirred he made a feeble motion to me with his hand pointing to the rope augustus gave no indication of life whatever and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass parker spoke to me when he saw me moving and asked me if i had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation saying that if i would summon up what spirits i could and contrive to untie him we might yet save our lives but that otherwise we must all perish i told him to take courage and i would endeavour to free him feeling in my pantaloons pocket i got hold of my penknife and after several ineffectual attempts at length succeeded in opening it i then with my left hand managed to free my right from its fastenings and afterward cut the other ropes which held me upon attempting however to move from my position i found that my legs failed me altogether and that i could not get up neither could i move my right arm in any direction upon mentioning this to parker he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes holding on to the windlass with my left hand so as to allow time for the blood to circulate doing this the numbness presently began to die away so that i could move first one of my legs and then the other and shortly afterward i regained the partial use of my right arm i now crawled with great caution towards parker without getting on my legs and soon cut loose all the lashings about him when after a short delay he also recovered the partial use of his limbs we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from peters it had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his woollen pantaloons and through two shirts and made its way into his groin from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage no sooner had we removed it however than he spoke and seemed to experience instant relief eing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself his was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood we had little hope that augustus would recover as he evinced no signs of life but upon getting to him we discovered that he had merely swooned from loss of blood the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death having relieved him from the fastenings and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass we secured him in a dry place to windward with his head somewhat lower than his body and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs in about half an hour he came to himself although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognising any of us or had sufficient strength to speak by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark and it began to cloud up so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing exhausted as we were by good fortune it continued very moderate during the night the sea subsiding every minute which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation a gentle breeze still blew from the n w but the weather was not at all cold augustus was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel as he was still too weak to hold on at all for ourselves there was no such necessity we sat close together supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation we derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them when we put them on after this they felt remarkably warm and pleasant and served to invigorate us in no little degree we helped augustus off with his and wrung them for him when he experienced the same comfort our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst and when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect our hearts sunk within us and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea we endeavoured however to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned and the weather still continued clear and pleasant with a steady but very light breeze from the n w the sea was now quite smooth and as from some cause which we could not determine the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before the deck was comparatively dry and we could move about with freedom we had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below as the brig was completely full of water we went to this work despondingly and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything we made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the companionatch into two pieces of wood tying these across each other and fastening them to the end of a rope we threw them into the cabin and dragged them to and fro in the faint hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be of use to us for food or which might at least render us assistance in getting it we spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect fishing up nothing more than a few bedclothes which were readily caught by the nails indeed our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated we now tried the forecastle but equally in vain and were upon the brink of despair when peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin this proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire he proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping the undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger for as we could hardly expect to find much if any provision in the cabin itself it was necessary that the diver after letting himself down should make a turn to the right and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet in a narrow passage to the storeroom and return without drawing breath everything being ready peters now descended into the cabin going down the companionadder until the water reached his chin he then plunged in head first turning to the right as he plunged and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom in this first attempt however he was altogether unsuccessful in less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn u we accordingly drew him up instantly but so incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder he had brought nothing with him and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck upon getting out he was very much exhausted and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend the second attempt met with even worse success for he remained so long under water without giving the signal that becoming alarmed for his safety we drew him out without it and found that he was almost at the last gasp having as he said repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it this was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder this balustrade was indeed so much in the way that we determined to remove it if possible before proceeding with our design as we had no means of getting it away except by main force we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder and giving a pull against it with our united strength succeeded in breaking it down the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might steady himself and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search for a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose but at length to our great joy we discovered one of the weatherorechains so loose that we had not the least difficulty in wrenching it off having fastened this securely to one of his ancles peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward room to his inexpressible grief however he found it locked and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance as with the greatest exertion he could remain under water not more at the utmost extent than a single minute our affairs now looked gloomy indeed and neither augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape but this weakness was not of long duration throwing ourselves on our knees to god we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us and arose with renewed hope and vigour to think what could yet be done by mortal means towards accomplishing our deliverance chapter shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years crowded with events of the most startling and in many cases of the most unconceived and unconceivable character we were lying on the deck near the companionay and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom when looking towards augustus who lay fronting myself i perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner greatly alarmed i spoke to him but he made me no reply and i was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill when i took notice of his eyes which were glaring apparently at some object behind me i turned my head and shall never forget the ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us and not more than a couple of miles off i sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart and stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel stood in this manner motionless and unable to articulate a syllable peters and parker were equally affected although in different ways the former danced about the deck like a madman uttering the most extravagant rhodomontades intermingled with howls and imprecations while the latter burst into tears and continued for many minutes weeping like a child the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig of a dutch build and painted black with a tawdry gilt figurehead she had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather and we supposed had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to ourselves for her foretopmast was gone and some of her starboard bulwarks when we first saw her she was as i have already said about two miles off and to windward bearing down upon us the breeze was very gentle and what astonished us chiefly was that she had no other sails set than her foresail and mainsail with a flying jib f course she came down but slowly and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy the awkward manner in which she steered too was remarked by all of us even excited as we were she yawed about so considerably that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us or imagined that having seen us and discovered no person on board she was about to tack and make off in another direction upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention and again hold on towards us his singular conduct being repeated two or three times so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us we then saw three seamen whom by their dress we took to be hollanders two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle and the third who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit this last was a stout and tall man with a very dark skin he seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have patience nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way and smiling constantly so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth as his vessel drew nearer we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water but of this he took little or no notice continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations i relate these things and circumstances minutely and i relate them it must be understood precisely as they appeared to us the brig came on slowly and now more steadily than before and cannot speak calmly of this event ur hearts leaped up wildly within us and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to god for the complete unexpected and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand of a sudden and all at once there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel which was now close upon u a smell a stench such as the whole world has no name for o conception of ellish suffocating nsufferable inconceivable i gasped for breath and turning to my companions perceived that they were paler than marble but we had now no time left for question or surmise he brig was within fifty feet of us and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter that we might board her without her putting out a boat we rushed aft when suddenly a wide yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running and as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet we had a full view of her decks shall i ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle twentyive or thirty human bodies among whom were several females lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of putrefaction we plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help yes long and loudly did we beg in the agony of the moment that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us would not abandon us to become like them would receive us among their goodly company we were raving with horror and despair horoughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment as our first loud yell of terror broke forth it was replied to by something from near the bowsprit of the stranger so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived at this instant another sudden yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view and we beheld at once the origin of the sound we saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark and still nodding his head to and fro but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it his arms were extended over the rail and the palms of his hands fell outward his knees were lodged upon a stout rope tightly stretched and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a cathead on his back from which a portion of the shirt had been torn leaving it bare there sat a huge seagull busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh its bill and talons deep buried and its white plumage spattered all over with blood as the brig moved further round so as to bring us close in view the bird with much apparent difficulty drew out its crimsoned head and after eying us for a moment as if stupified arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting and flying directly above our deck hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and liverike substance in its beak the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of parker may god forgive me but now for the first time there flashed through my mind a thought a thought which i will not mention and i felt myself making a step towards the ensanguined spot i looked upward and the eyes of augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses i sprang forward quickly and with a deep shudder threw the frightful thing into the sea the body from which it had been taken resting as it did upon the rope had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive as the gull relieved it of its weight it swung round and fell partially over so that the face was fully discovered never surely was any object so terribly full of awe the eyes were gone and the whole flesh around the mouth leaving the teeth utterly naked this then was the smile which had cheered us on to hope this the ut i forbear the brig as i have already told passed under our stern and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward with her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of deliverance and joy deliberately as she went by we might possibly have found means of boarding her had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body we had seen and felt but we could neither think nor act until alas too late how much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming i have since this period vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger her build and general appearance as i have before stated led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion we might have easily seen the name upon her stern and indeed taken other observations which would have guided us in making out her character but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to everything of that nature from the saffronike hue of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever or some other virulent disease of the same fearful kind if such were the case and i know not what else to imagin death to judge from the positions of the bodies must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming in a way totally distinct from that which generally characterizes even the most deadly pestilences with which mankind are acquainted it is possible indeed that poison accidentally introduced into some of their seatores may have brought about the disaster or that the eating some unknown venomous species of fish or other marine animal or oceanic bird might have induced it ut it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved and will no doubt remain for ever involved in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery chapter we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness hiding her from our sight recalled us in some measure to our senses the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned absorbing all other cares and considerations nothing however could be done until the morning and securing ourselves as well as possible we endeavoured to snatch a little repose in this i succeeded beyond my expectation sleeping until my companions who had not been so fortunate aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provision from the hull it was now a dead calm with the sea as smooth as i have ever known it he weather warm and pleasant the brig was out of sight we commenced our operations by wrenching off with some trouble another of the forechains and having fastened both to peters feet he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open provided he could get at it in sufficient time and this he hoped to do as the hulk lay much more steadily than before he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door when loosening one of the chains from his ankle he made every exertion to force a passage with it but in vain the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated he was quite exhausted with his long stay under water and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place for this service parker immediately volunteered but after making three ineffectual efforts found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door the condition of augustus wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance peters had left one of the chains in the passage and i found upon plunging in that i had not sufficient ballast to keep me firmly down i determined therefore to attempt no more in my first effort than merely to recover the other chain in groping along the floor of the passage for this i felt a hard substance which i immediately grasped not having time to ascertain what it was but returning and ascending instantly to the surface the prize proved to be a bottle and our joy may be conceived when i say that it was found to be full of port wine giving thanks to god for this timely and cheering assistance we immediately drew the cork with my penknife and each taking a moderate sup felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth strength and spirits with which it inspired us we then carefully recorked the bottle and by means of a handkerchief swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken having rested a while after this fortunate discovery i again descended and now recovered the chain with which i instantly came up i then fastened it on and went down for the third time when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever in that situation would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom i therefore returned in despair there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope and i could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish the wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium which perhaps i had been prevented from feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it they talked incoherently and about matters unconnected with our condition peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket augustus too i remember approached me with a serious air and requested me to lend him a pocketomb as his hair was full of fish scales and he wished to get them out before going on shore parker appeared somewhat less affected and urged me to dive at random into the cabin and bring up any article which might come to hand to this i consented and in the first attempt after staying under a full minute brought up a small leather trunk belonging to captain barnard this was immediately opened in the faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink we found nothing however except a box of razors and two linen shirts i now went down again and returned without any success as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck and upon getting up saw that my companions had ungratefully taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before i saw them i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of their conduct when augustus burst into tears the other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke but i hope never again to behold laughter of such a species the distortion of countenance was absolutely frightful indeed it was apparent that the stimulus in the empty state of their stomachs had taken instant and violent effect and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated with great difficulty i prevailed upon them to lie down when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber accompanied with loud stertorous breathing i now found myself as it were alone in the brig and my reflections to be sure were of the most fearful and gloomy nature no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine or at the best by being overwhelmed in the first gale which should spring up for in our present exhausted condition we could have no hope of living through another the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly insupportable and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it with my knife i cut off a small portion of the leather trunk and endeavoured to eat it but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel although i fancied that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out towards night my companions awoke one by one each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror brought on by the wine whose fumes had now evaporated they shook as if with a violent ague and uttered the most lamentable cries for water their condition affected me in the most lively degree at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations their conduct however gave me great uneasiness and alarm for it was evident that unless some favourable change took place they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety i had not yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from below but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while i went down parker appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others and i endeavoured by every means in my power to arouse him thinking that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect i contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body and then leading him to the companionay he remaining quite passive all the whil pushed him in and immediately drew him out i had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment for he appeared much revived and invigorated and upon getting out asked me in a rational manner why i had so served him having explained my object he expressed himself indebted to me and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation we then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way which we immediately did when they both experienced much benefit from the shock this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the showerath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania potu finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope i again made three or four plunges into the cabin although it was now quite dark and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady in the course of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two casenives a threeallon jug empty and a blanket but nothing which could serve us for food i continued my efforts after getting these articles until i was completely exhausted but brought up nothing else during the night parker and peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner but nothing coming to hand we now gave up this attempt in despair concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief but to no purpose the sea was still smooth with only a long swell from the northward as on yesterday this was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink with the exception of the bottle of port wine and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained i never saw before nor wish to see again human beings so utterly emaciated as peters and augustus had i met them on shore in their present condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i had ever beheld them their countenances were totally changed in character so that i could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a few days before parker although sadly reduced and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom was not so far gone as the other two he suffered with great patience making no complaint and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every manner he could devise for myself although at the commencement of the voyage i had been in bad health and was at all times of a delicate constitution i suffered less than any of us being much less reduced in frame and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood generally simpering in their expressions with idiotic smiles and uttering the most absurd platitudes at intervals however they would appear to revive suddenly as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour and speak for a short period of their prospects in a manner altogether rational although full of the most intense despair it is possible however that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine and that i may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and imbecilities as themselves his is a matter which cannot be determined about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming towards it peters and augustus took little notice of what he said being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation upon looking in the direction pointed out i could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore ndeed i was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature it was a long time nevertheless before i could convince parker of his mistake he then burst into a flood of tears weeping like a child with loud cries and sobs for two or three hours when becoming exhausted he fell asleep peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather i advised them to chew it and spit it out but they were too excessively debilitated to be able to follow my advice i continued to chew pieces of it at intervals and found some relief from so doing my chief distress was for water and i was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves the day wore on in this manner when i suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward and on our larboard bow she appeared to be a large ship and was coming nearly athwart us being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant none of my companions had as yet discovered her and i forbore to tell them of her for the present lest we might again be disappointed of relief at length upon her getting nearer i saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us with her light sails filled i could now contain myself no longer and pointed her out to my fellowufferers they immediately sprang to their feet again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy weeping laughing in an idiotic manner jumping stamping upon the deck tearing their hair and praying and cursing by turns i was so affected by their conduct as well as by what i now considered a sure prospect of deliverance that i could not refrain from joining in with their madness and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck clapping my hands shouting and other similar acts until i was suddenly called to my recollection and once more to the extreme of human misery and despair by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented towards us and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which i had at first perceived her it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such misrepresentations the conduct of augustus most sensibly affected me in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us and in making preparations to go on board of her some seaweed floating by the brig he maintained that it was the ship boat and endeavoured to throw himself upon it howling and shrieking in the most heartrending manner when i forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea having become in some degree pacified we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her the weather becoming hazy with a light breeze springing up as soon as she was entirely gone parker turned suddenly towards me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder there was about him an air of selfossession which i had not noticed in him until now and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say he proposed in a few words that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others chapter i had for some time past dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which i laboured the proposition had not been heard by either peters or augustus i therefore took parker aside and mentally praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained i expostulated with him for a long time and in the most supplicating manner begging him in the name of everything which he held sacred and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested to abandon the idea and not to mention it to either of the other two he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my arguments and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed upon to do as i desired but when i had ceased speaking he said that he knew very well all i had said was true and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained that it was unnecessary for all to perish when by the death of one it was possible and even probable that the rest might be finally preserved adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period i now begged him if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design at least to defer it for another day when some vessel might come to our relief again reiterating every argument i could devise and which i thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature he said in reply that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late as regarded himself at least finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a mild tone i now assumed a different demeanour and told him that he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our calamities that my health and strength
