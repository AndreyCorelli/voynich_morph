it was one of the conclusions arrived at by adelung that the same language would not maintain itself beyond the limit of a hundred and fifty thousand square miles but by means of books the limits of the world alone are the limits within which language and the enjoyment of it can be confined letters waft a sigh from indus to the pole and printed volumes carry thoughts that breathe and words that burn over the great oceans from one quarter of the world to another such a volume is the one now in the hand of the reader it is freighted with a dozen pleasant papers or essays the subjects of which are not confined to america exclusively they furnish us with text and afford opportunity for illustrative comment profiting by this opportunity let me commence by observing in reference to the opening essay that the inns and taverns of london underwent a great change after the death of james the first the rights of honest topers were suppressed by his son king charles who for the poor fee of an annual three pounds sterling granted licences to taverneepers to sell wines at what prices they pleased in spite of all statutes to the contrary you may fancy how flushed the face of a thirsty cockney might become who on putting down his eightpence for a quart of claret was told by francis the drawer that the price was a full quarter noble or nendightpence lord goring who issued these licences pocketed a respectable amount of fees in return by statute london had authority only for the establishment of forty taverns but what did roystering george goring care for statute since the king gave him licence to ride over it taverns multiplied accordingly not only in the city but in those uburbs as they were once called fragrant drury lane and refined onvent garden with competition came lower prices however and the throats of the londoners were refreshed while their purses were not so speedily lightened jolly places they became again but when they not only increased all over the town but took to ictualling as it was termed as well as iquoring the authorities began to inquire into the matter with the claret that was drunk a corresponding amount of venison was eaten at the same time the king bucks began to disappear and suspicion arose that gentlemen in taverns dined off his sacred majesty deer a watch was set to prevent such felonious fare being carried into london from any of the royal parks chases or forests still haunches smoked on the boards of those naughty victualling taverns and haughty cockneys reatly daring dined the stolen bucks were smuggled in over bow bridge and not till that passage was occupied by representatives of legal authority did the venison intended for the court cease to find its way into the city the drama at this time lingered about blackfriars and the bankside bacchus emigrated westward before thespis in in onvent garden and the ittle lane adjacent which had then just begun to be called russell street there were not less than eight taverns and twenty alehouses this was thought to be so much beyond the requirements of the public thirst that an order was issued to reduce the number of taverns to two and the alehouses to four the suburban public cried out against the drinking privileges of the city where claret was tapped in taverns and ale ran from the spigot from before breakfast till after supperime the council directed the attention of the lord mayor thereto and in inquiry was made as to how many taverns had been newly opened since the year the reply was ixty and one in the return it is pleasant to read of the oar head as n ancient tavern teetotallers will perhaps entertain due regard for agsishaw ward as being the only one in the city described as having ever a tavern within that ward but then basing hall or bagsishaw ward was of such small extent as to be rather contemptuously spoken of by stowe himself who calls it small thing consisting of one street an inhabitant of this ward had therefore only to step into the next street if he wanted a stoup of bordeaux or a flagon of ale if he swore over his liquor he was liable to the penalty of a shilling and if he went on his way home noisily with more claret under his belt than he well knew how to carry he might be mulcted of a crown these fines were distributed among the poor so that the more drinking and profanity abounded the better for those poor to be blasphemous was to be on one of the blessed paths of charity city chronicles tell of one richard dixon who having more of an eccentric compassion for the distressed than regard for propriety swallowed his claret swore a score of oaths and deposited twenty shillings with the town clerk for london paupers sober people in the city however complained of the increasing number of inns and taverns orders were issued accordingly and a boniface here and there took down his bush at the beginning of the week but hung it up again before saturday the temperance party furnished a list of taverns new and old in the city in october at that time shakspeare and washington irving oar head in eastcheap was kept by one william leedes ot by any licence from the king majesty but s a freeman will leedes may well have seen shakspeare who had not then been dead a score of years and we may fancy mine host guests discussing the second edition of the folio which had then been out of the press not much above twelve months in spite of the law for the suppression of certain taverns these remained open and new inns were built the fashion and delicacy of drury lane were deeply affected by the threatened building of a tavern in that refined locality in addition to eleven already existing there the master of his majesty tents one thomas jones resided in drury lane and he petitioned the council to prohibit the above building as being to the great prejudice of the royal tentaster nd other neighbours being men of eminent quality the greatest blow at the old taverns was the prohibition of ictualling taverneepers beset the king for licences to cook and retail meat t being says one petition thing much desired by noblemen and gentlemen of the best rank and others for the which if they please they may also contract beforehand as the custom is in other countrie there being no other place fit for them to eat in the city this was in cheapside but there was also will mead house in bread street it had ever been resorted to by citizens and foreigners on account of its famous fish dinners the company had always been ellffected of the very best quality too gentlefolk who conformed themselves to the laws made for eating fish upon days appointed if will mead be not permitted to vend his lenten fare then he is eprived of his best way of subsistence having applied himself and bred up many servants only for the dressing of fish as licence had been given to two vintners to ress and vent flesh will prays for similar licence to dress and vend fish also will was landlord of that very ermaid of which mr tuckerman speaks in his first essay he ermaid of ben jonson who had then just closed his dramatic career with love welcome he ermaid which some thirty years earlier had been kept by the poet namesake johnson and which had been a ermaid where men of quality took their wine as early at least as the time when the houses of york and lancaster were at bloody strife for the crown of his our england but occasionally men of quality died as well as drank in a london inn i am not sure that it was not in this very ermaid that richard de grey the sixth lord grey of ruthyn died in an utterly penniless gambler his son henry from poverty never assumed any title of honour and it was not until the time of his greatrandson reginald that the honour and fortune were restored of a family of which the present baroness grey de ruthyn is the representative those old inns had their tragic as well as their gayer aspects a man was as likely to die poisoned as ruined by gaming in some of them for example in eighteen pipes of white wine belonging to peter van paine a foreigner were seized and lord mayor parkhurst wrote to the council that n eight of them were found eight bundles of weeds in four some quantities of sulphur in another a whole piece of match besides in every cask a kind of gravel mixture by which mixtures the wines are conceived to be very unwholesome and of the like nature with those which were formerly destroyed peter van paine must have dealt in a compound of the quality of modern hamburg sherry a compound that would have been deeply declined by the poorest of those authors who form the subject of the second essay poor authors against no class of men have the acutelyointed shafts of satire been more frequently darted congreve who had so little cause to be ashamed of the name yet persistently rejected the honour of being supposed to be one of the brotherhood when voltaire visited him the french writer expressly stated that the compliment was addressed to the author and not to merely mr congreve the latter remarked that he was a entleman and not an author whereupon the polite frenchman rejoined that if congreve had been only a gentleman he the french author would never have thought of calling upon him at all a wicked wit some hundred and odd years ago made the early pages of sylvanus urban lively by inventing a census of surviving english authors these he set down in round numbers at three thousand who had produced in the preceding year of abortive works born dead and not one that survived the year itself three hundred and twenty perished by sudden death and a few thousands went to line trunks make skyocket cases hold pies or were consumed by worms one thousand of these literary gentlemen are said to have died of lunacy a rather greater number were tarved seventeen were hanged fifteen committed suicide five pastoral poets died of fistula others in various ways while a difference was suggested as to the diet lives and deaths of aldermen and authors in a zero indicating the number of writers who died of urfeit perhaps one of the most singular reasons for founding a periodical and undertaking much of the authorship and editorship presents itself in the case of the celebrated french physician th ophraste renaudet he had a number of nervous anxious restless patients who required little more than to have their minds drawn from the unprofitable occupation of dwelling upon the condition of the body the great doctor did not wish that the thoughts of his patients should be allowed to dwell very much upon anything books of science politics or polemical theology were not at all what he required the romances of the day were stilted pompous things quite as difficult for invalids to read as any of the inflated treatises on scientific political and theological subjects renaudet may be said to have been a pupil of the philosophical school of hippias that selfeliant teacher of elis maintained that a portion at least of manly virtue consisted in being able to dispense with the assistance of other men hippias never allowed any man to help him in any matter wherein he could help himself he was accordingly his own tailor shoemaker hairdresser laundress and cook how the philosopher looked when he went abroad or how he fared when he dined at home it is at once awful and amusing to think of renaudet did not go quite so far as the elian but in case of his patients failing to find help in others he took the matter into his own hands and founded the gazette de france it was better if not for himself at least for his patients than if he had discovered a new remedy for prevalent diseases those pleasant little paragraphs of news were as so many pleasant fillips to the lazy intelligences of the nervous those fresh supplies of little scandals were as fresh pinches of rappee to the arid nostril all athirst for dust those brief hints and innuendoes were as gentle titillations not strong enough to exhaust but just sufficient to exhilarate refresh and strengthen nervous patients recovered many who might otherwise have become so did not fall ill and every one was delighted with renaudet attempt at authorship except his fellowractitioners the most of whom then lived upon the nerves of the fashionable public renaudet authorship had a benevolent and unselfish motive as an example of audacity in the same line i know nothing that can compare with a circumstance which occurred in the middle of the last century there was at that time in oxford an honest watchmaker named greene he was a great reader and a great admirer of milton but like the artist who had just finished a painting on a signboard and contemplated his performance with a commiserating thought of titian and the complacent cry of poor little tit so the oxford watchmaker tapped his forehead like poor andr chenier before execution and thought he had omething there beyond any possession that could be boasted of by mortal sons of song accordingly greene published a specimen of a new version of paradise lost in blank verse of the watchmaker own adaptation y which he modestly remarked hat amazing work is brought somewhat nearer the summit of perfection poor greene ummit of perfection might lead one to believe that his ideas of improvement were not directed towards milton only but that he wished to give a new version to the old joke the point of which lay in he height of acme it is a singular fact that one of the best literal renderings of milton into a foreign language is one into french by jean de diur it is lineal metaphrastic and literal consequently you have as it were the words of the song but only faint or rather no echoes of the music nevertheless the patience and conscientiousness of the translator are to be seen in the fidelity with which he has interpreted the significance of the terms another original phase of authorship may be here recorded since it is in connection with milton while the oxford watchmaker was carrying paradise lost to the summit of perfection by his improvements landor was carrying through the press his essay on milton use and imitation of the moderns the author described the attempt as one hitherto never made in prose or rhyme the method by which he sought to prove his case against milton was by naming certain authors whom he supposed the poet to have consulted and then giving quotations from them to expose milton plagiarisms the case startled the world only for a while competent defenders of milton authorship arose and they proved that milton had not plagiarised from the sources named by landor but that the latter had forged his quotations in order to traduce milton the discovery made every one eager to avoid landor as a rogue and to possess his book as a curiosity a french author flung his poisoned dart also at milton voltaire accused him of taking his epic from an old italian mystery the adamo by andr ivi but milton has had gallant champions in french authors too their judgment is that if milton created his great epic out of the chaos of the old mystery he in a certain sense resembled the creator who out of brute clay created man in the image of the creator himself dmon in angloaxon and st avitus in latin likewise treated of the creation and the fall long before milton but as another french author guizot has remarked t is of little importance to milton glory whether he was acquainted with them or not he was one of those who imitate when they please for they invent when they choose and they invent even while imitating true authorship could not be more happily defined than under those words and they may be applied in reference to another attempt to question milton originality in the statement that he founded his epic on the old drama adamo caduto by salandra moreover there is nothing more in common between milton and his predecessors than that he selected a subject which they had sung before him their tune is on an oaten reed but milton sits down to the organ and billows of sound roll forth to awe and enchant the world in our own country milton made but low way not merely with the general but with the educated public dryden supposed he wrote paradise lost in blank verse because he was unable to do it in rhyme johnson depreciated him by asserting that if he could cut a colossus out of the rock he could not carve heads upon cherrytones as if milton briefer poems and sonnets were unworthy of the author of the great epic hannah more united with johnson not only in thinking these briefer poems bad but in critically examining why they were so but there is no end to the vagaries of authors when judging of other writers dryden in his essay on dramatic poetry makes shakspeare the homer and johnson the virgil of dramatic composition but in his defence of the epilogue to the conquest of granada he informs us that shakspeare abounds in solecisms and nonsense in lameness of plot meanness of writing in comedy that cannot raise mirth and tragedy that cannot excite sympathy and most wonderful of all placing shakspeare on a level with fletcher he says ad they lived now they would doubtless have written more correctly if you would know to what correct level dryden thought shakspeare might have been brought had he had the good luck to live later the knowledge is vouchsafed in the assertion that he well placing of words for the sweetness of pronunciation was not known till mr waller introduced it this is quite as bad as the criticism of addison who bracketed lee and shakspeare together accused them of a spurious sublimity and gave it as his opinion that n those authors the affectation of greatness often hurts the perspicuity of style these great literary artists understood shakspeare so indifferently that they were unable to picture him truly to themselves or to represent him naturally to others milton called sweetest shakspeare ancy child dryden says his fancy limped and addison hints that his sublimity rendered him obscure perhaps some among us may be inclined to smile at mr tuckerman allusion in his chapter on pictures to a portrait of n american matronly belle of the days of washington by stewart which represents the type of mingled selfeliance and womanly loveliness that has made the ladies of our republican court so memorably attractive of the attraction of the ladies there can be no doubt but can a republic care to pride itself on such an institution as a ourt la rochefoucauld said very well of royal courts in europe that they did not render those that tarried in them happy but that they prevented those who had tarried at them from being happy elsewhere it may be added that there is only one royal court on record where every one was equal and that was the proverbially celebrated ours du roi p taut but the equality there led to inextricable confusion because every one wished to command and no one cared to obey now the court of king p taut has very much extended itself so wide indeed are its limits that it may be said to embrace all society which has become a grand court where dissimulation and distrust splendour without and anxieties within abundantly prevail some one has compared that tremendous institution called ociety as well as courts generally to those magnificent illegulated gilt clocks to be seen in france the exterior is dazzling with beauty but inside everything is going wrong among old court fashions of the last century was one of having a portrait of the eye of course this was only of ladies eyes yes that slew the peace of mortal man nd the counterfeit presentiment of one of which was held to be a solace to the memory and a stimulant to hope lovers carried about with them the figure of one of the presume two eyes of their respective ladies there was an affected modesty in this fashion and if i may so speak the mode most prevailed when modesty or a decent reserve which might pass for it was least in fashion it has been a disputed question whether painting or poetry was the earlier born it would be as difficult to determine whether calliope wrote heroic songs before clio painted heroic deeds probably poetry which preceded prose in the early festive ceremonies of the human race bards sang of high deeds before less gifted men made long speeches about the was earlier than painting the actions of heroes were first fixed on the artist imagination by the songs of the bards and the praise of orators but there is a prettier theory touching the origin of portraitainting in the story of the youth who drew the outline of the one face he loved by tracing with charcoal its shadow on the wall purposely disposed to enable him to display this primitive effort of art and of affection as we may not take all portraits of our ancestors for ver effigies so are the portraits of more modern heroes not to be accepted without due reserve there was for instance a series of lives of the british admirals with illustrative portraits and charles lamb sat for them all desmahis says rather saucily of the ladies but they must have been those of his time and not the general se that when they go to have their portraits taken they wish the artist to be faithless and the portrait to be a likeness steele has similar satire clerimont in the tender husband says that his fancy is utterly exhausted with inventing faces for his sitters gave my lady scornwell he says he choice of a dozen frowns before she found one to her liking i suppose in these days the fair are not so exacting in the very ancient days noble sitters were even more so it was death to the painter as well as to his reputation if he failed to please a roman emperor i shudder when i think of the artist who received a commission to paint a fullength of nero it was more than life size it was a hundred and twenty feet high and there was possible death in every inch of it michael angelo had a good idea of the simple dignity of an artist on being told of one who painted pictures with his fingers he simpleton said he e had better keep to his pencils a picture painted without pencils is however not so curious a fact as publishing a book that never was written mr tuckerman volume reminds me of another set of essays which were published in called colloquies desultory but chiefly upon poetry and poets it is a very agreeable volume of pages but not a word of it was really ever written the clever printer and publisher mr lordan of romsey set up the types as fast as he mentally composed the book and the latter is highly creditable to the author who however never wrote it lord palmerston respected this ingenious man and collectors of singular books keep a good look out for a work that was published before the author penned a word of it the next curiosity to an author who did not write his own book passing over the authors who really did write books by other people is perhaps the physician who scorned to take fees mr tuckerman has pretty well exhausted the subject of doctors let me notice how few of them resemble those protohristian physicians cosmas and damian who won the glorious name of anargyri or the because out of their abundant charity they gave dvice gratis which it must be said is a commodity often worth the price it costs when you get it for nothing those lastamed amiable physicians were arabians by birth and among those people some curious ideas still prevail touching the relations between medical men and patients when the late dr hogg was travelling with lamartine in the east it was the physician happiness to cure of a very horrible disease a poor and pious arab who had been reduced almost to despair the cure was slow but at last it was perfect and the gratitude of the arab to god the prophet and dr hogg was beyond all bounds the convalescent waited on his mortal benefactor and told him that he was the greatest of the wonders of the world the medico fancying the grateful fellow might embarrass himself by overstraining his means in order to evince his gratitude told him that all had been done for the love of god and the good of a fellowreature and that nothing more was to be said about it but the arab had much more to say about it od he remarked ad conferred upon the christian doctor a power beyond that possessed by any other man the prophet had permitted him to find a remedy for the maladies which had beset one of the faithful gratitude taking the form of cash payment was therefore indispensable need no payment said the doctor ust so effendi replied the countryman of cosmas and damian t is so i understand it but the chief of doctors will not be ungrateful for the power he has been permitted to exercise behold the servant whom he has been allowed to make whole let the effendi show his thankfulness by bestowing on his servant bakshish between these two extremes of physicians altogether declining fees and patients requesting them from physicians as testimonies of gratitude for cure almost miraculously wrought modern practice has established itself on a pretty good basis but the old theory yet not the old reality as to fees still exists the honorarium is slipped into the physician hand with an air of there being nothing in it and that unworldly person often looks like cosmas and damian as if he had taken nothing by it a question of health connects itself closely with the subject of the next essay on holidays many a soldier in the noble army of workers owes much of his health to the keeping of holidays mr tuckerman regrets that his country does not take rest and rejoice on some common national holiday at least once a year now all christian nations have one that they may celebrate once a week but some among us are doing their conscientious best to turn the joyous festival into a gloomy fast god granted the day but some among us misinterpret the meaning of the grant obstruct rest and enjoyment and only change one sort of labour for another let all the nation go up and praise the lord but for ther things mild heav a time ordains and disapproves that care though wise in show that with superfluous burden loads the day and when god sends a cheerful hour refrains the making of a holiday rendered famous for ever a philosopher whose reputation would not have spread so widely through his philosophy when anaxagoras was dying he was asked if he had any particular desire that should be fulfilled y said the clazomenian n the anniversary of my death let all the boys have a holiday thence arose the anaxagorica festivals in which the boys rejoiced not that anaxagoras had died on that day but that he had lived during many years of usefulness before it mr bright never shook the faith of his own followers so much as when he voted against the shortening of the hours of labour of women and children in the cotton mills the contrast between the ancient and the modern philosopher is not to the disadvantage of the heathen but there are some persons who are averse to much leisure time on workingays and to any air of enjoyment on sundays a scotchman who had gone back to his country after a long absence declared after going to kirk that the whole kingdom was on the road to perdition he people he said sed to be reserved and solemn on the sabbath but now they look as happy on that day as on any other with regard to what is asserted in this volume respecting the judicial and legal excellence of modern times compared with a past period the assertion cannot be admitted without a certain reserve we may look back at those old brehon laws which st patrick himself could not amend or even make more clear when he attempted to be for them what coke afterwards was upon lyttleton for instance if a brehon judge were to utter an absurdity ere he for instance to say that he was inclined to believe in the folly of a criminal which folly had led to crime and were the judge to inflict a ridiculously light sentence in consequence the ruth of nature as the phrase then ran would have been violated and a blotch would fix itself on the face of the judge for ever one might reasonably suppose that no brehon judge ever exposed himself to be twice so branded but human nature is as weak as it is perverse we read in the ancient laws of ireland of a certain sencha mac aililla who the more he was lotched the wickeder he grew he seemed to defy the brand as others have defied public opinion he did not care what the law was when he had to administer it between a member of his own tribe and one of another clan he would decide in favour of his own ountry as he called it irrespective of law and justice this exemplary sencha used to retire from the judgmenteat daily with three additional fiery blotches to those he bore the day previous the monster became so ugly that he was fain at last to withdraw from the public gaze it was the same with the lawyers in those felicitous times if one ventured upon a cotch insinuation such as deliberately accusing a witness of forgery and on the accusation being immediately shown to be groundless pleading that the charge was simply an nsinuation perfectly professional on the brehon nose of such an unworthy lawyer a carbuncle would establish itself like a light on a disagreeable object to help you to avoid it a brehon lawyer never even played with a lie but a pimple started on his tongue and checked his speech if a brehon judge were addicted to the wineup it was as much as his nose or at least the end of it was worth to potter about excess from the bench if he lived an unclean life and then judicially talked solemn sham to the ignorant and immoral a burning st anthony fire or whatever name it was called before st anthony overspread his face and never left it nay there is record of unjust kings and judges laughing at the commission of crime till their mouths extended from ear to ear and remained so for ever after it must have been then that divine astr a bandaged her eyes were she to open them now and glance over the world she would behold bench and bar unstained by a blush nevertheless a sigh may be permitted for the good old brehon times when wicked lawyers blushed in spite of themselves in many respects those old times or their customs have not so completely passed away as might be generally thought in connection with mr tuckerman next subject of sepulchres i may notice those military funerals at which the horse of the dead rider follows his master to the grave there is now no significance in such a matter but it was once of very stern reality and not a mere form it is now simply a relic of the times when the steed was slain at the side of the tomb of his defunct master a tomb which the horse was destined to share with the departed soldier the faithful horse like the indian dog was to keep him company in the fields beyond the waters of oblivion it was a pagan ceremony but it did not finally go out till somewhat late in the christian era n fact not till towards the close of the last century on the th of february there was a military burial at treves a cavalry general in the service of the palatinate a teutonic knight and commander of lorraine named frederick kasimir was then and there buried according to the rites of the order of chivalry of which he was a member as soon as the coffin was lowered into the grave the general horse was led up by the officer who had had it in charge during the funeral procession an official then advanced and by a skilful sweep of a sharp huntingnife across the animal throat stretched him dead after which the dead horse was thrown into the grave on the top of the coffin it was a hideous ceremonial the origin of which dates from the days when skeleton knights were supposed to require skeleton chargers the above was the last occasion on which such a ceremony was performed the favourite horse that followed the duke of wellington funeral car the caparisoned steed that was but yesterday led after the bier of the dragoon who used to mount him were but formalities the meaning of which is for the most part forgotten there was a period when a grave and much ceremony were thus afforded to brutes but when also the grave as begrudgingly allowed and all ceremony denied to men i allude to the actors which pleasant brotherhood forms the subject of mr tuckerman next essay this has been especially the case in france thence some erroneously suppose that actors were excommunicated by the roman catholic church whereas the ecclesiastical authorities at rome especially protected the italian players in paris from the ban proclaimed by the gallican bishops against actors and actresses in england there has been more liberality of feeling towards the players these have had individual clerical enemies from archbishop grindal down to dean close but they have also had as many friends from archbishop bancroft down to the present archbishop of dublin who amidst groups of actors and a large general public in stratford church at the last shakspeare centenary gave expression to wise and loving testimony in behalf of that poor player on whom god conferred the gifts that made of him the foremost poet of the entire world as between plaintiff and defendant the opposite cases were succinctly stated by dean close and mr buckstone the dean once denounced the brethren of the drama generally as wicked people mr buckstone simply replied that while there was no crime subject to capital punishment but that a clergyman had suffered for it there was no instance of an actor ever having been hanged for any crime this is not quite correct but the rare exception testifies to the general rule one actor has been hanged and two or three richly deserved to be but speaking generally they have been distinguished for the good observance of prudence and the excellent practice of charity lord southampton described the players at the lackfriars as arried men and of reputation even in grindal days though there were some among them of equivocal conduct and character they were designated as hose grave and sober actors burbage fortune is a proof of their thrift alleyn noble bequests are so many proofs of his godlike charity in every path of his life from st botolph bishopsgate down to dulwich college he has left proofs of a benevolence which still brings enjoyment to numberless legatees alleyn letters afford us a glance into the household of a player of the seventeenth century and they show that the house was well kept and that a spirit of piety sanctified it so of betterton his hand and his heart were open and liberal what were quinn faults in the light of his delicate and profuse charity the same question might be asked in reference to many other actors they have not only shown as the tatler once said of his dramatic contemporaries a wonderful benevolence towards the interests and necessities of each other but towards those of all who needed succour they have played equally well in this respect on and off the stage and all that need be added in regard to them may be said in the quaint words of sir thomas overbury who remarks value a worthy actor by the corruption of some few of the quality as i would do gold in the ore i should not mind the dross but the purity of the metal theatrical criticism in early days found no place in our newspapers even as late as the first appearance of sprangor barry in thello a the journalist only recorded the fact adding as a sort of critical notice that the gentleman got as much applause as could be expected an essay on newspapers might extend to a folio volume they have all been founded on the insatiable appetite that humanity has to know what has happened to its fellows the difference is not so great between the earliest and the latest samples of newspapers the eading article which so often misleads is comparatively of modern origin but the roman acta diurna may be said to correspond with our reports and general intelligence chronicling human errors heroism and rascality pillorying the names of young fellows who had quaffed too deeply of the falernian and noting how the fine imposed on a felonious butcher who gave short weight was to be devoted to the building of a chapel in the temple of tellus for the propagation of the gospel of that deity and the reformation of light weights if the subject of newspapers could be exhausted in a single essay it has been done by mr tuckerman of journalism generally a very summary phrase of southey renders a rather acrid judgment he had been alluding to the fact of marchmont needham having published the mercurius britannicus for the parliament the mercurius pregmaticus in the king interest and the mercurius politicus in support of oliver his consequent remark was that ournalists in that age had about as much probity as in this but these mercurii were something like the moniteur the official paper of the predominant power for the time being in the latter is imperial majesty napoleon of one day was he corsican usurper of the next one man may have written both phrases but two governments uttered them the writer was a part of the pen used by a couple of superior officials each of whom employed the pen to express antagonistic sentiments there was once a period when the office now performed by a journalist was occasionally undertaken by the preacher we learn from old chroniclers that scarcely an event which very closely affected the public ever took place without its being shadowed forth from the pulpit rufus was in all probability not slain by sir walter tyrrel but that he was treacherously slain cannot be disputed if the record be true that god vengeance against the wicked in high places was a theme very much dwelt upon by the popular preachers of the day en who addressed themselves to the judgments impulses and prejudices of the people in the reign of the second edward contemporary events were employed for illustrative purposes from the pulpit the putting away of the king was discussed there under similitudes as a matter in a solemn national crisis might now be weighed and examined more openly in an eloquent leader the pulpit at paul cross alone would furnish a thousand illustrations of how the preacher could deftly mingle politics with religion patriotism was then stimulated in a time of approaching war by the priest reciting the ede roll of the king enemies and solemnly cursing every one of them amidst the popular acclamation church and state met and shook hands sometimes with a mask on the face of each at the trystinglace of paul cross but there may be sermons efficiently delivered from other places besides pulpits ermons in stones formed a poet phrase which led to another rendering of the sentiment included in it by a modern poetess mrs browning in her sonnet on power greek slave sees a purpose as well as a beauty in it and she exclaims fair stone from god pure height of beauty against man wrong catch up in thy divine face not alone east griefs but west and strike and shame the strong by thunders of white silence overthrown the image indeed is rather a bold one reminding us of the soliloquy in a french tragedy commencing with the observation quel silence se fait entendre while directing attention to mr tuckerman pleasant paper on statues it may be worth while recording that under the christian era sculpture was first employed by a woman under the influence of gratitude for a manifestation of the divine mercy the story is indeed only traditional but it is ancient and comes down to us through eusebius according to that historian the woman of paneas after having been cured of her disease as mentioned in the gospels returned to her native place and set up in one of the streets there an image of the saviour with the figure of herself in the act of adoration this group of statuary the material indeed is not mentioned and the word image sometimes implies picture was the progenitor of all the effigies of god and the saints that have since been erected in public highways in order to stimulate the religious fervour of the passers by if that alleged protoroup did not exactly effect this the story of the grateful woman and her statuary led to the same result it may be a mere legend but even then the legend itself was in such case invented for the purpose of bringing about the adoption of the fashion of setting up images challenging the reverence of all who looked on them and it was afterwards appealed to as authority alike for the fashion and the observance nowhere have statues been erected with greater effect than on bridges they who remember the bridge at prague over the moldau with the statues and groups of saints st john neoponuck towering over all will confirm this fact the fashion has not been followed in our own country where there are some relics however of bridge architecture said to be as old as the days of the britons such are rather fondly said to be the small red stone arches spanning the streams in some of the cornish valleys we may rest more satisfied however with the triangular bridge at croyland which was completed in the year after the island was first called england namely a whether we can in the days of queen victoria detect in the structure any of the stones the laying of which was watched by the curious lincolnshire folk in the reign of king egbert may be reasonably doubted the foundations rather than the superstructure of the original bridge alone remain this bridge was of great importance to the monastery of croyland but indeed as much may be said of all bridges and their vicinities to build them was a holy work the title of ontifex belonged to the highest of the sacred classes of rome ontifex maximus is a designation which the pope himself inherits from the roman emperors and ontificum coen is a phrase by which we learn from horace that the sacred successors of those who erected the sublician bridge were persons who with some care for the souls and welleing of the people had a special regard for their own bodies perhaps it was because of this connection between holy men and bridges that in early english times the keeping of our bridges and of the roads leading to them was intrusted to hermits who were in fact the original tollakers and turnpikeeepers in england old london bridge which was commenced in and finished in which was the only bridge at london over the thames till that of westminster was opened in and which lasted till the new bridge was inaugurated in by william the fourth was the work of a holy pontifex peter colechurch chaplain of st mary in the poultry the architect found fitting burial place in the crypt of the chapel of st thomas which stood in the centre of the bridge itself thus the london bridge which peter built became his sepulchre and monument when peter died but it is time that i should be at least as silent as peter himself since mr tuckerman is ready and the stage prepared the first little piece is played out and the curtain now rises to a better sustained drama and to a finished actor plaudite j doran inns hoer has travelled life dull round whater his fortunes may have been must sigh to think how oft he found life warmest welcome at an inn shenstone the old legitimate delightful idea of an inn is becoming obsolete like so many other traditional blessings it has been sacrificed to the genius of locomotion the rapidity with which distance is consumed obviates the need that so long existed of byay retreats and haltinglaces a hearty meal or a few hours sleep caught between the arrival of the trains is all the railway traveller requires and the modern habit of moving in caravans has infinitely lessened the romantic probabilities and comfortable realities of a journey the rural alehouse and picturesque hostel now exist chiefly in the domain of memory crowds haste and ostentation triumph here over privacy and rational enjoyment as in nearly all the arrangements of modern society old walton would discover now but few of the secluded inns that refreshed him on his piscatorial excursions the ancient ballads on the wall have given place to french paper the scent of lavender no longer makes the linen fragrant instead of the crackle of the open woodire we have the dingy coalmoke and exhalations of a stove and green blinds usurp the place of the snowy curtains not only these material details but the social character of the inn is sadly changed few hosts can find time to gossip the clubs have withdrawn the wits the excitement of a stageoach arrival is no more and a poet might travel a thousand leagues without finding a romantic aid of the inn such as southey has immortalized jollity freedom and comfort are no longer inevitably associated with the name the world has become a vast procession that scorns to linger on its route and has almost forgotten how to enjoy thanks however to the conservative spell of literature we can yet appreciate in imagination at least the good old english inn goldsmith village alehouse has daguerreotyped its humble species while dr johnson evenings at the itre keep vivid the charm of its metropolitan fame indeed it is quite impossible to imagine what british authors would have done without the solace and inspiration of the inn addison fled thither from domestic annoyance dryden chair at ill was an oracular throne when hard pressed steele and savage sought refuge in a tavern and

informed that a wellhumbed volume of the english bards had been seen soon after its publication at a little hostel in albany elia quaint anecdote of the quakers when they all ate supper without paying for it and irving tout gentleman are incidents which could only have been suggested by a country inn and as to the novelists from smollett and fielding to scott and dickens the most characteristic scenes occur on this vantageround where the strict unities of life are temporarily discarded and its zest miraculously quickened by fatigue hunger a kind of infinite possibility of events a singular mood of adventure and pastime nowhere else in civilized lands so readily induced it is therefore by instinct that these enchanting chroniclers lead us thither from old chaucer to our own longfellow gil bias acquired his first lesson in a knowledge of the world by his encounter with the parasite at the inn of panafleur and don quixote enthusiasm always reaches a climax at these places of wayside

have sweet anne page and jolly falstaff made the very name of the arter inn in the east a monastery in the desert a tent on the nile a boat a hacienda in south america a kiosk in turkey a caff in italy but in britain an inn is the pilgrim home and one not less characteristic the subject as suggestive of the philosophy of civilization is worth investigation in england and in towns of angloaxon origin where the economies of life have a natural sway we find inns representative in london especially a glance at the parlour wall reveals the class to whose convenience the tavern is dedicated in one the portraits of actors in another scenes in the ring and on the racecourse here the countenance of a leading merchant and there a military effigy suggest the vocation of those who chiefly frequent the inn nor are local features less certain to find recognition a view of the nearest nobleman estate or his portrait ornaments the sittingoom and the observant eye can always discover an historical hint at these public resorts heywood the dramatist aptly specified this representative character of inns he gentry to the king head the nobles to the crown the knights unto the golden fleece and to the plough the clown the churchman to the mitre the shepherd to the star the gardener hies him to the rose to the drum the man of war to the feathers ladies you the globe the seamen do

historical landmarks in the middle ages the ross keys the hree kings and t francis abounded the puritans substituted for ngel and lady the oldier and citizen the aracen head was a device of the crusades and before the oach and horses was the sign of the ackhorse indicative of the days of equestrian travel many current anecdotes attest the virtue of an old and the hazards of a new inn sign as when the loyal host substituted the head of george the fourth for the ancient ass which latter effigy being successfully adopted by a neighbouring innkeeper his discomfited rival had inscribed under the royal effigy his is the real ass thackeray cites an inn sign as illustrative of scotch egotism n cuparife he writes here a little inn called the battle of waterloo and what do you think the sign is the battle of waterloo is one broad scotchman laying about him with a broadsword the coffeeoom of the best class of english inns carpeted and curtained the dark rich hue of the old mahogany the ancient plate the fourost bed the sirloin or mutton joint the tea muffins cheshire and stilton the ale the coalire and the times form an epitome of england and it is only requisite to ponder well the associations and history of each of these items to arrive at what is essential in english history and character the impassable divisions of society are shown in the difference between the ommercial and the offeeoom the timeorn aspect of the furniture is eloquent of conservatism the richness of the meats and strength of the ale explain the bone and sinew of the race the tea is fragrant with cowper memory and suggestive of east india conquests the cheese proclaims a thrifty agriculture the bed and draperies comfort the coalire manufactures while the times is the chart of english enterprise division of labour wealth selfsteem politics trade courtife naccessibility to ideas and bullyism the national subserviency to rank is as plainly evinced by the plates on chamberoors at the provincial inns setting forth that therein on a memorable night slept a certain scion of nobility and from the visitor at the great house of a neighbourhood when sojourning at the inn thereof is expected a double fee as an instance of the inappropriate of that stolid insensibility to taste and tact which belongs to the nation consider the english waiter his costume is that of a clergyman or a gentleman dressed for company and in ridiculous contrast with his menial obeisance perhaps it is the selfmportance nourished by this costume which renders him such a machine incapable of an idea beyond the routine of handing a dish and receiving a sixpence old hobson whose name is proverbially familiar went with his wain from cambridge to the ull inn bishopsgate street london lement inn

every one from whom they came had meant to put his whole wit in a jest and had resolved to live a fool the rest of his dull life the author of peter wilkins was a frequent visitor at an hostel near clifford inn and dr johnson frequented all the taverns in fleet street old slaughter coffeeouse in st martin lane was the favourite resort of hogarth the house where jeremy taylor was born is now an inn and prior uncle kept an inn in london where the poet was seen when a boy reading horace this incident is made use of by johnson in his lives of the poets in a very caustic manner for after relating it he observes of prior that n his private relaxations he revived the tavern and in his amorous pedantry he exhibited the college there is no city in europe where an imaginative mood can be so indefinitely prolonged as at venice and in the early summer the traveller after gliding about all day in a gondola and thinking of barbarossa faliero titian and the creations of shakspeare otway byron and cooper at evening from under the arches of st mark square watches the picturesque and sometimes mysterious figures and then between mossrown palaces and over lone canals returns to his locanda to find its aspect perfectly in accordance with his reverie at least such was my experience at the olden lion the immense salleanger was dimly lighted and the table for two or three guests set in a corner and half surrounded by a screen when i raised my eyes from my first dinner there they fell on a large painting of the death of seneca a print of which had been familiar to my childhood and thus memory was ever invoked in venice and her dissolving views reflected in the mirror of the mind unbroken by the interruptions from passing life that elsewhere render them so brief the mere fact of disembarking at the weedy steps the utter silence of the canal invaded only by the plash of the gondolier oar or his warning cry at the angle the tessellated pavement and quaintlyarved furniture of the bedroom and a certain noiseless step and secretive gravity observable in the attendants render the venetian inn memorable and distinct in reminiscence and in perfect harmony with the place and its associations during the late revolutionary era in europe the inn tables of germany afforded the most reliable index of political opinion the free discussion which was there indulged brought out every variety of sentiment and theory as it included all classes with a due sprinkling of foreigners from the old novel to the new farce indeed the extremes of public opinion and the average tone of manners the laughable contreemps and the delightful adventure are made to reveal themselves at inns so that political sects and all vocations are identified with them to rip van winkle the most astonishing change he discovered in his native village after his long nap was the substitution of washington likeness for that of king george on the tavern sign the dark staircase rising from the mule stable of a posada the bare chambers woolnotted mattresses odour of garlic and vegetables swimming in oil are items of the spanish inn not likely to be forgotten by the epicurean traveller but good beds and excellent chocolate are to be found at the most uninviting spanish inns and the imaginative traveller enjoys the privilege of sojourning at the very one where don quixote was knighted in highlyivilized lands inns have not only a national but a professional character the sign the pictures on the wall and the company have a certain individuality arine in sailors inns pugilistic in sporting ones and picturesque in those haunted by artists the lines of demarcation are as visible as those which separate newspapers and shops in the grand division of labour that signalizes modern life the inn also has thus become an organ and a symbol even their mottoes and symbols give traditional suggestions or emblazon phases of opinion natural history has been exhausted in supplying effigies mythology has yielded up all her deities and institutions heroes and localities are kept fresh in the traveller imagination by their association with reature comforts thus he dreams of cromwell at the umbleown dick and of the stuarts at the ing charles in the oak the days of chivalry at the tar and garter or the roix de malta of brilliant campaigns at the agram and montmorency of woman love at the etrarch and laura and of man at the reemasons tavern my host at ravenna had been byron purveyor during the poet residence there and he was never weary of descanting upon his character and the incidents of his sojourn in fact upon discovering my interest in the subject he forgot the landlord in the cicerone and gave no small part of a day to accompanying me to the haunts of the bard our first visit was to the guiccioli palace and here he described his lordship dinners with the precision and enthusiasm of an antiquarian certifying a document or medal then he took me to the pine forest and pointed out the track where byron used to wheel his horse at full gallop and discharge his pistol at a bottle placed on a stump xercises preparatory to his grecian campaign at a particular flagstone in the main street my guide suddenly paused ignore said he ust as milord had reached this spot one evening he heard the report of a musket and saw an officer fall a few rods in advance dismounting he rushed to his side and found him to be a familiar acquaintance an agent of the government who had thus become the victim to private vengeance byron had him conveyed to his own apartment and placed on a bed where in half an hour he expired this event made a deep impression on his mind he was dispirited for a week and wrote a description of death from a shot which you will find in his poems derived from this scene with such local anecdotes my byronic host entertained me so well that the departed bard ever since has seemed to live in my remembrance rather than my fancy whoever has eaten trout caught in the arno at the little inn at tivoli or been detained by stress of weather in that of albano will not forget the evidences the walls of both exhibit that rollicking artists have felt at home there such heads and landscapes caricatures and grotesque animals as are there improvised baffle description a well is the inn of the desert he dragoman usually looks out for some place of shelter says the author of over the lebanon to balbek he shadow of a ruin or the covering of a grove of figrees is the most common and if possible near a well or stream the first of all considerations is to reach a spot where you can get water so that throughout the east the well answers to the old english halfay house and roadide accommodation for man and beast which gave their cheerful welcome to the tally ho and red rover that flourished before this age of iron the pedestrian in wales sometimes encounters a snug and beautifullyituated hostel perhaps the ngler rest where five minutes beside the parlour fire and a chat with the landlady or her pretty daughter give him so complete a home feeling that it is with painful reluctance he again straps on his knapsack at liberty to muse by the everinging teaettle if the weather is unpropitious stroll out in view of a noble mountain or a fairy lake in the warm sunset or hear the news from the last wayfarer in the travellers room and there is thus mingled a sense of personal independence comfort and solitude which is rarely experienced even in the most favoured domain of hospitality an equally winsome but more romantic charm holds the roaming artist who stops at albano or volterra where the dreamy campagna or etruscan ruins alternate with groups of sunburnt contadini lighted up by the charcoal glow in a way to fascinate salvator before his contented gaze his portfolio fills up with miraculous rapidity and the still life is agreeably varied by the scenic costumes and figures which grace the vintage or a festa some humble champollion could easily add to the curiosities of literature by a volume gleaned among inn inscriptions rom the marble tablet announcing the sojourn of a royal personage to the rude caricature on the whitewashed wall and the sentimental couplet on the windowane to say nothing of the albums which enshrine so many tributes to etna and the white mountains he heirlooms of abbat the famous padrone of catania and crawford of the notch sicily is famous for the absence of inns and the intolerable discomfort of those that do exist but mine host of catania was the prince of landlords a fine specimen of manly beauty and with the manners of a gentleman he seemed to think his guests entitled to all the courtesy which should follow an invitation he made formal calls upon them and gave sage advice as to the best way to pass the time fitted them out with hospitable skill and experienced counsels for the ascent of etna and brought home choice game from his hunting excursions as a present to the tranger within his gates his discourse too was of the most bland and entertaining description he was fellow of infinite wit of most excellent fancy and these ministrations derived a memorable charm from a certain gracefulness and winsome cordiality no wonder his scrapook is filled with eulogiums and that the traveller in sicily by the mere force of contrast records in hyperboles the merits of the orona dro alas for the mutability of inns and their worthy hosts abbat was killed by an accidental shot during an meute in catania in the waxed floor light curtains and gay paper of a parisian bedroom however cheerful are the reverse of snug but in the provincial inns of the continent with less of comfort there is often more historical interest than in those of england the stone staircases and floors and the scanty furniture are forlorn and the exuberance of the host civility is often in ludicrous contrast with the poverty of his larder an hour or two in the dreary salleanger of a provincial french inn on a rainy day is the acme of a voyageur depression the restaurant and caf have superseded the french inns of whose gastronomic renown and scenes of intrigue and violence we

ravaillac went from a tavern to assassinate henry the fourth and fashionable orgies were carried on in the emple cellars it is not uncommon to find ourselves in a friar dormitory the large hotels in the minor towns having frequently been erected as convents and in italy such an inn as that of terracina with its legends of banditti and its romantic site the waves of the mediterranean moaning under its lofty windows infallibly recalls mrs radcliffe in the cities many of the hotels are palaces where noble families have dwelt for centuries and about them are perceptible the traces of decayed magnificence and the spell of traditional glory and crime to an imaginative traveller these fanciful attractions often compensate for the absence of substantial merit and there is something mysterious and winsome in the obsolete architecture and fallen grandeur of these edifices uge shadows glide along the high cornices the mouldy frescoes look as if they had witnessed strange vicissitudes and the imagination readily wanders through a series of wonderful experiences of which these old palazzi have been the scene here as elsewhere in the land it is the romantic element the charm of antiquity that is the redeeming feature for picturesque beauty of situation neatness and rural comfort some of the inns of switzerland are the most delightful on the continent inviting the stranger to linger amid the clear fresh and glorious landscape and relish the sweet butter white bread and unrivalled honey and eggs served so neatly every morning by a fair mountaineer with snowy cap and gay bodice i am a lover of the woods and sometimes cross the bay with a friend to long island and pass a few hours in the strip of forest that protected our fugitive army at the battle of flatbush there are devious and shadowy paths intersecting it and in spring and autumn the wild flowers radiant leaves and balmy stillness cheer the mind and senses fresh from the dust and bustle of the city often after one of these woodland excursions we have emerged upon a quiet road with farmouses at long intervals and orchards and grainields adjacent and followed its course to a village whose gableoofed domicile and ancient graveyard indicate an old settlement and here is a little inn which recalls our idea of the primitive english alehouse it has a little dutch porch a sunny garden the liquor is served from the square bottles of holland the back parlour is retired and neat and the landlady sits all day in the window at her sewing and when a little acquainted will tell you all about the loveffairs of the village the cheese and sourrout at dinner suggest a flemish origin the old sign that hangs at the roadide was brought to this country by an english publican when the fine arts were supposed to be at so low a stage as to furnish no dick tinto equal to such an achievement it represents the arms of great britain and doubtless beguiled many a trooper of his majesty when long island was occupied by the english no sooner however had they retreated than the republican villagers forced the landlord to have an american eagle painted above the king escutcheon indeed it is characteristic of inns that they perpetuate local associations put your head into an italian boardingouse in new york and the garlic macaroni and red wine lead you to think yourself at naples the snuff dominoes and gazettes mark a french caf all the world over in montreal you wake up in a room like that you occupied at marseilles and at halifax the malt liquor is as english as the currency he sports of the inn yards are noted often in the memoirs of elizabeth reign in a late biography of lord bacon his brother anthony is spoken of as aving taken a house in bishopsgate street near the famous ball inn where plays are performed before cits and gentlemen very much to the delight of essex and his jovial crew and in allusion to the earl conspiracy the lower class of inns then and there are thus described rom kens like

the golden ball where we had a frugal supper and a little punch as the finances of none of the company were in very good order but we had rich enough conversation on literary subjects enlivened by smollett agreeable stories which he told with peculiar grace and his more than clerical zest for such a rendezvous is apparent in his notice of another favourite inn t was during this assembly that the inn at the lower end of the west bow got into some credit and was called the diversorium thomas nicholson was the man name and his wife nelly douglas nelly was handsome thomas a rattling fellow here often met robertson the historian horne the dramatist hume jardine and other notable men of the scotch metropolis to facilitate their intercourse when in london they also stablished a club at a

for public entertainment of man and beast the inns of switzerland will bear the test of reminiscence better than those of any other part of the continent the solitary system of the english inn is objectionable discomfort is proverbial in havannah hotels the gardenables and music in the german hostels are pleasant social features and with all their frugal resources the farmtations in norway boast the charm of a candid and na ve hospitality which sweetens the humble porridge of the weary traveller t is scarcely credible says an nprotected female in her record of travel there hat such predamite simplicity of heart still exists on earth in pictures and diaries the german landlord is always lightaired and holds a beer tankard and the hotels in the british west indies according to a recent traveller are always kept by at middleged coloured ladies who have no husbands rose writing to hallam from italy hints the union of romantic and classical associations which some of the inns conserve and inspire that of ivita castellana he remarks s on the classic route from rome to florence and is a type of the large italian inns such as one finds in romances balconies terraces flowers of the south large courts open for posthaises othing is wanting when heine visited germany he tells us how the conservative habits of his fatherland newly impressed him in the familiar and oldashioned dishes ourrout stuffed chestnuts in green cabbages stockfish swimming in butter eggs and bloaters sausages fieldfares roasted angels with appleauce and goose in medi val times in that part of europe from the isolation of inns they were emphatically the places to find an epitome of the age oldiers monks noblemen and peasants surrounded the same stove shared the contents of the same pot and often the straw which formed their common bed the proverb was are not built for one the salutations benisons and curses the motley guests the lack of privacy the trinkgeld and stirrupup the murders and amours the converse and precautions the orgies and charities thereof were each and all characteristic of the unsettled state of society the diversities of rank the common necessities and the priestly military and boorish elements of life and manners but the rarity of any publicouse as we understand the term is more characteristic of those times than the incongruous elements therein occasionally exhibited here seems says an ancient historian o have been no inns or houses of entertainment for the reception of travellers during the middle ages this is a proof of the little intercourse which took place between different nations the duty of hospitality was so necessary in that state of society that it was enforced by statutes it abounded and secured the stranger a kind reception under any roof where he chose to take shelter on first entering an inn at havreerace i found the landlady taking leave of the captain of an american packet ship he had paid his bill not without some remonstrance and his smiling hostess with true french tact was now in the act of bidding so pleasing a farewell as would lure him to take up his quarters there on the return voyage she had purchased at the market a handsome bouquet and tied it up jauntily with ribbons the ruddy seaog face of the captain was half turned aside with a look of impatience at the idea of being inveigled into goodature after her extortion but she not a whit discouraged held her flowers up to him and smiling with her fair hand on his rough dreadaught overcoat turned full to his eye a sprig of yellow blossom and with irresistible na vet whispered mon cher capitaine cst immortel comme mon attachement pour vous it was a little scene worthy of sterne and brought the agreeableness and the imposition of the innkeepers of the continent at once before me one evening in florence i was sent for by a countryman who lodged at the most famous hotel in that city and found him perambulating his apartment under strong excitement of mind he told me with much emotion that the last time he had visited florence was twenty years before with his young and beautiful wife the belle of the season that winter was the marchesa she gave a magnificent ball and in the midst of the festivities took the young american couple into her boudoir and sung to them with her harp her vocal talent was celebrated but it was a rare favour to hear her and this attention was prized accordingly ou know added my friend hat i came abroad to recover the health which grief at my wife death so seriously impaired and you know how unavailing has proved the experiment on my arrival here i inquired for the best inn and was directed hither upon entering this chamber which was assigned me something in the frescoes and tiles struck me as familiar they awoke the most vivid associations and at last i remembered that this is the very room to which the beautiful marchesa brought us to hear her sing on that memorable evening the family are dispersed and her palace is rented for an hotel hence this coincidence among the minor local associations to be enjoyed at rome not the least common and suggestive are those which belong to the old ear inn where montaigne lodged not only the vicissitudes but the present fortunes of european towns are indicated by the inns i arrived at ancient syracuse at sunset on a spring afternoon and dismounted at an inn that looked like an episcopal residence or government house so lofty and broad were the dimensions of the edifice but not a person was visible in the spacious court and as i wandered up the staircases and along the corridors no sound but the echo of my steps was audible at length a meagre attendant emerged from an obscure chamber and explained that this grand pile was erected in anticipation of the american squadron in the mediterranean making their winter quarters in the harbour of syracuse a project abandoned at the earnest request of the king of naples who dreaded the example of a republican marine in his realm and then so rarely did a visitor appear that the poor lonely waiter was thrown into a fit of surprise from which he did not recover during my stay to the stranger no more characteristic evidence of our material prosperity and gregarious habits can be imagined than that afforded by the large showy and thronged hotels of our principal cities they are epitomes of the whole country at a glance they reveal the era of upholstery the love of ostentation the tendency to live in herds and the absence of a subdued and harmonious tone of life and manners the large mirrors and bright carpets which decorate these resorts are entirely incongruous he brilliancy of the sunshine and the stimulating nature of the climate demand within doors a predominance of neutral tints to relieve and freshen the eye and nerves it is characteristic of that devotion to the immediate which de tocqueville ascribes to republican institutions that these extravagant and gregarious establishments in our country are so often named after living celebrities in the mercantile literary and political world this custom gives those who enjoy this distinction while living he freedom of the house it greatly amused the friends of our modest geoffery crayon when encouraged by his affectionate kinswoman and his friend kennedy to ravel on his capital under the pressure of necessity he once thus desperately claimed the privileges of his honoured name wherefrom his sensitive nature habitually shrunk arrived in town safe he writes from new york to his niece nd proceeded to the irving house where i asked for a room what party had i with me none had i not a lady with me no i was alone i saw my chance was a bad one and i feared to be put in a dungeon as i was on a former occasion i bethought myself of your advice and so when the book was presented to me wrote my name at full length from sunnyside i was ushered into an apartment on the first floor furnished with rosewood yellow damask and pierlasses with a bed large enough for an alderman and his wife a bathoom adjoining in a word i was accommodated completely en prince the negro waiters all call me by name and vie with each other in waiting on me the chambermaid has been at uncommon pains to put my room in firstate order and if she had been pretty i absolutely should have kissed her but as she was not i shall reward her in sordid coin henceforth i abjure all modesty with hoteleepers and will get as much for my name as it will fetch kennedy calls it travelling on one capital the extravagant scale upon which these establishments are conducted is another national feature at once indicating the comparative ease with which money is acquired in the new world and the passion that exists here for keeping up appearances it would be useful to investigate the influence of hotel life in this country upon manners whatever may be the result as to the coarser sex its effect upon women and children is lamentable owering the tone compromising the taste and yielding incessant and promiscuous excitement to the love of admiration the change in the very nature of young girls thus exposed to an indiscriminate crowd is rapid and complete modesty and refinement are soon lost in overonsciousness and moral hardihood but perhaps the most singular trait in the american hotel is the deference paid to the landlord instead of being the servant of the public he is apparently the master and a traveller who makes the now rapid transition from a new york to a liverpool hotel might think himself among a different race the courteous devotion almost subserviency in the one case being in total contrast with the nonchalance and even despotism of the other the prosperous security of the host with us and the dependence of his guest for any choice of accommodation is doubtless the most obvious reason for this anomaly but it is also in a degree at least to be referred to the familiarity with which even gentlemen treat the innkeepers to use a vulgar phrase they descend to curry favour and minister to the selfsteem of a class of men in whom it is already pampered beyond endurable bounds no formula of republican equality justifies this behaviour and it usually reacts unfavourably for the selfespect of the individual some foreigner remarked with as much truth as irony that our aristocracy consisted of hoteleepers and steamboat captains and appearances certainly warrant the sarcasm it was not always thus when washington lodged at the old walton mansionouse which had been converted to an inn the old negro who kept it was the ideal of a host an air of dignity as well as comfort pervaded the house through the open upper half of the broad door played the sunshine upon the sanded threshold at the head of the long easy staircase ticked the oldashioned clock fullength portraits by copley graced the parlour wall the old dutch stoop looked the emblem of hospitality no angular figures were ranged to squirt tobaccouice no pert clerks lorded it from behind a mahogany barricade but the glow of the windows at night the alacrity of the sedate waiter the few but respectable guests and the prolonged meals of which but two or three partook gave to the inn the character of a home lafayette wrote to his wife in while descanting with enthusiasm upon the simplicity of manners in this country he very inns are different from those in europe the host and hostess sit at table with you and do the honours of a comfortable meal and on going away you pay your fare without higgling an english traveller who visited this country soon after the revolutionary war speaks of the ncomplying temper of the landlords of the country inns in america hey will not says another ear the treatment we too often give ours at home they feel themselves in some degree independent of travellers as all of them have other occupations to follow nor will they put themselves into a bustle on your account but with good language they are very civil and will accommodate you as well as they can the general custom of having two or three beds in a room to be sure is very disagreeable it arises from the great increase of travelling within the last few years and the smallness of their houses which were not built for houses of entertainment it is a most significant indication of our devotion to the external that ovations at which the legislators of the land discourse and eulogies that fill the columns of the best journals celebrate the opening of a new tavern or the retirement of a publican the confined and altitudinous cells into which so many of the complacent victims of these potentates are stowed and their habits of subserviency to the rules of the house which are perked up on their chamberalls induced a sicilian friend of mine to complain that sojourners at inns in this land of liberty were treated like friars the gorgeous luxury of the metropolitan inns is reversed in the small towns where without the picturesque situation we often find the discomfort of the continent under date of march john winthrop first governor of massachusetts records in his journal amuel cole set up the first house of common entertainment in boston according to the famous literary ruse of irving and wirt knickerbocker facetious history and the letters of a british spy were found in the innhamber of a departed traveller of old the american inn or tavern as it was called subserved a great variety of purposes one of new england local historians says he taverns of olden time were the places of resort for gentlemen and one consequence was good suppers and deep drinking they also performed the office of newspapers the names posted on the several tavernoors were a sufficient notice for jurors saturday afternoon was the time when men came from all quarters of the town to see and hear all they could at the tavern where politics and theology trade barter and taxes were all mixed up together over hot flip and strong toddy he taverns served also as places for marketing during most of the winter they were filled every night with farmers who had brought their pork butter grain seeds and poultry to market most families supplied themselves through these opportunities and purchased the best articles at moderate prices andlords could not grow rich very fast on country custom the travelling farmer brought all his food for himself in a box and that for his horse in a bag he therefore paid only twelve cents for his bed and as much for horseeeping it was not uncommon to have six days expenses amount only to two dollars auctions theatricals legerdemain caucuses military drills balls and dancingchools all came in place at the tavern especially sleighiding parties found them convenient ou will not go into one wrote brissot in ithout meeting with neatness decency and dignity the table is served by a maiden wellressed and pretty by a pleasant mother whose age has not effaced the agreeableness of her features and by men who have that air of respectability which is inspired by the idea of equality and are not ignoble and base like the greater part of our own taverneepers in wansey the commercial traveller already cited tells us he lodged at the unch of grapes in boston and paid five shillings a day including a pint of madeira he had an interview with citizen genet and dr priestley at the ontine near the battery in new york and saw frenchmen with tricolour cockades at the ndian queen on the boston road rivial data for his journal then and yet now suggestive of the political and economical condition of the land whereof even tavern bills and company are no inadequate test a sagacious reminiscent informs us that he taverns of boston were the original business exchanges they combined the countingouse the exchangeffice the readingoom and the bank each represented a locality to the lamb tavern called by the sailors sheep baby people went to see a man from dedham t was the resort of norfolk county the old eastern stageouse in ann street was frequented by downasters captains of vessels formerly from the penobscot and kennebec there were to be seen groups of sturdy men seated round an enormous fireplace chalking down the price of bark and lumber and skippers bringing in a vagrant tarpaulin to sign the articles to the exchange coffeeouse resorted the nabobs of essex county here those aristocratic eastern towns newburyport and portsmouth were represented by shipowners and shipbuilders merchants of the first class dealers in butter and cheese went to the city tavern in brattle street favourite sojourn of members of the general court ts courtard crowded with teams loaded with the best pork from vermont and western massachusetts and the wooden notions of yankee rustics the last of the old boston taverns was the once famous elmtreet house a rendezvous of stageoaches teams and transient boarders which was kept up in the old style until fairly drawn from the field by modern improvements indeed this slight mention of the functions and fortunes of inns in the new england metropolis hints more than a volume of statistics the progress of her growth and the cause of her social transitions locomotion has completely done away with the local affinities of the past and emigration modified the individuality of class and character which of old gave such special interest to the inn we are too gregarious luxurious and hurried to indulge in these primitive expedients at the old aleigh tavern in virginia ot long since destroyed by fire atrick henry lodged when he made his memorable but as a patriotic orator in the house of burgesses and it was in a chamber of this inn that he prepared his speeches and that the great leading men of the revolution in that state assembled to consult some of the inns in canada are named after the indian chiefs mentioned in the earliest records of exploration by cartier at the rauncis tavern in new york washington took leave of his officers and the ocial club still famous in the annals of the city met military men appreciate good inns washington wrote to frauncis and lafayette praised him one of the latest of memorable associations connected with the inns of new york is that which identifies the ity hotel with the naval victories of the last war with england no one who listened to the musical voice of the late ogden hoffman as he related to the st nicholas society at their annual banquet his personal memories of that favourite hotel will fail to realize the possible dramatic and romantic interest which may attach to such a resort even in our unromantic times and in the heart of a commercial city visions of naval heroes of belles in the dance witty coteries and distinguished strangers political crises and social triumphs flitted vividly before the mind as the genial reminiscent called up the men women f tes and follies there known a recent english traveller in the united states in alluding to the resemblance he discovered to what was familiar at home speaks of one relic which has caught the eye of few as suggestive of the old country here is he observes n baltimore an old inn with an old sign standing at the corner of eutaw and franklin streets just such as may still be seen in the towns of somersetshire and before it are to be seen old wagons covered and soiled and battered about to return from the city to the country just as the wagons do in our own agricultural counties how near to us the record of aiting at an inn brings the renowned fter dinner writes washington in the diary of his second visit to new england hrough frequent showers we proceeded to the tavern of a mrs haviland at rye who keeps a very neat and decent inn mendelssohn ideal as was his tone of mind wrote zestfully to his sister neat civil frenchwoman keeps the inn on the summit of the simplon and it would not be easy to describe the sensation of satisfaction caused by its thrifty cleanliness which is nowhere to be found in italy lockhart when an assiduous oxford scholar found his choicest recreation in quiet row on the river and a fishinner

discussion which gave to the sanded parlour of the village alehouse the air of the pal stra at tusculum or the amaltheum of cum it is impossible to conceive any house of entertainment more dreary than some of the stageouses as they were called in new england the baroom with an odour of stale rum the parlour with its everlasting sampler over the fireplace weeping willow tombstone and inscription the peacock feathers or asparagus boughs in the chimney as if in cheerful mockery the lookinglass that reflects every feature awry the crossights of the windows inquisitive loungers pierust like leather

landlady had grenadier proportions and red cheeks a few peasants were drinking ale beneath a roof whence depended flitches of bacon and with the frocks the yellow hair and the full ruddy features we

rested at an inn on their way to egypt and it was at the hree taverns in the suburbs of rome that paul was met by the brethren venerable as are these allusions in sacred history the visible token of the antiquity of inns that strikes our imagination most vividly is the winetains on the marble counter in pompeii falstaff absolutely requires the frame of an inn to make his portrait intelligible with the buxom figure of mrs quickly in the background and it may safely be asserted that no public house of entertainment has afforded such worldide mirth as the oar head eastcheap the freaks of tony lumpkin have their natural scope at an alehouse and goldoni locandiera is a fine colloquial piece of real life even the most eloquent of england historians cites the superior inns that existed in the range of travel there during the early part of the seventeenth century as a reliable evidence of the prosperity and civil advancement of the nation these inns are in fact the original retreats for reedom and comfort whence our pleasant ideas on the subject are derived they still exist in some of the rural districts of the kingdom and the cleanliness good fare and retirement of the oldashioned english inn as well as the freshness and urbanity of the host wholly justify their renown the exigencies of the climate and the domestic habits of the people explain this superiority where so much enjoyment is sought within doors and the national character is reserved and individual better provision is naturally made both for the physical welleing and the privacy of the wayfarer than is required under less inclement skies and among a more vivacious and social race a most characteristic note of boswell is that which records his idol hearty encomiums on a tavern while dining at one in london both the man and the place then combined to realize the perfection of the idea for that dim and multitudinous city invites to secluded conviviality and that irritable dogmatic yet epicurean sage required the liberty of speech an absolute deference and the solid physical comforts so easily obtained at a london tavern there he could make narticulate animal noises over his food without restraint there he could bring only such companions as would bear to be contradicted and there he could refresh body and mind without fear of intrusion from a printer devil or needy author bores and duns away a good listener by surrounded with pleasant viands and a cheerful blaze a man so organized and situated might without extravagance call a tavernhair the throne of human felicity and quote shenstone praise of inns with rapture beneath this jovial appreciation however there lurks a sad inference it argues a homeless lot for lonely or ungenial must be the residence contrast with which renders an inn so attractive and we must bear in mind that the winsome aspect they wear in english literature is based on their casual and temporary enjoyment it is as recreative not abiding places that they are usually introduced and in an imaginative point of view our sense of the appropriate is gratified by these landmarks of our precarious destiny for we are but ilgrims and sojourners on the earth jeremy taylor compared human life to an inn and archbishop leighton used to say he would prefer to die in one authors igh is our calling friend creative art whether the instrument of words she

while the whole world seems adverse to desert wordsworth some of the fondest illusions of our studentife and companionship were based on literary fame the only individuals of the male gender who then seemed to us indiscriminate and mutual lovers of literatur worthy of admiration and sympathy were authors our ideal of felicity was the consciousness of distributing ideas of vital significance and causing multitudes to share a sentiment born in a lonely heart the most real and permanent sway of which man is capable we imagined that of ruling and cheering the minds of others through the medium of literature our herbals were made up of flowers from the graves of authors their signatures were our only autographs the visions that haunted us were little else than a boundless panorama that displayed scenes in their lives we used continually to see in fancy petrarch beside a fountain under a laurel with the sweet penseroso visible in his portraits dante in the corridor of a monastery his

fiction we nearly suffocated ourselves in the crowded gallery of the old church at cambridge listening to sprague phi beta kappa poem and often watched the spiritual figure of the dle man and gazed on the white locks of our venerable painter with his onaldi and aint king vividly remembered we wearied an old friend of brainard by making him repeat anecdotes of the poet and have spent hours in the french coffeeouse which halleck once frequented eliciting from him criticisms anecdotes or recitations of campbell new haven people that came in our way were obliged to tell all they could remember of the vagaries of percival and the elegant hospitality of hillhouse we have followed judge hopkinson through the rectangular streets of his native metropolis with the tune of hail columbia humming in our ears and kept a curious eye on howard payne through a whole evening party fondly cognizant of sweet home beaumont and fletcher were our damon and pythias the memorable occurrence of our childhood was the advent of a new waverley novel and of our youth a fresh edinburgh review we loved plumolour because poor goldy was vain of his coat of that hue and champagne partly because schiller used to

butter with the author of werther daisies with burns and primroses with wordsworth mrs thrale acceptance of piozzi was a serious trouble to our minds and whether ittle burney would be happy after her marriage with the noble emigr was a problem that made us really anxious until the second part of her diary was procurable and relieved our solicitude an unpatriotic antipathy to the pilgrim fathers was quelled by the melodious p an of mrs hemans and we kept vigils before a portrait of mrs norton at an artist studio with a chivalric desire to avenge her wrongs this enthusiasm for authors was not altogether the result of a literary idiosyncrasy or local influences it grew out of a consciousness of personal obligation mrs radcliffe miss porter and maturin were the clandestine intimates of childhood the english poets became the confidants of youthful sentiment which met but a cool reception from those by whom we were surrounded and when judgment was enough matured to discriminate the charms of style a new world opened under the guidance of mackenzie and sterne lady montagu and sir thomas browne books are endeared like people by the force of circumstances ideal tendencies a spirit of inquiry a thirst for sympathy will often drive minds whose environment is uncongenial to seek therein what is elsewhere denied and when in early life this resource becomes habitual it is not surprising that a deep personal feeling should be gradually engendered and that we should come to regard favourite authors as the most reliable and dearest of our companions and this without an inkling of pedantry or a title to scholarship but from a thoroughly human impulse intellectually vindicating itself to such a pitch did the feeling once possess us that we resented any imputation cast upon our chosen authors as if they were actual friends we honoured the critic that defended bacon from the charge of meanness and longed to applaud his prowess we disliked to admit the evidence that johnson was dogmatic and ascribed his arrogance to a kind of excusable horselay we contended that thomson was not lazy but encouraged ease to escape ambition we grew very warm if any one really believed shelley an atheist and argued that his faith transcended that of the majority of soalled christians we never would admit that sterne was heartless or moore a toady we could have embraced dr madden after reading his infirmities of genius and thought the most brave of sidney deeds his defence of poesy how we longed to go aishing with walton to walk in cowley garden to see roscoe library to hear coleridge talk to feel the grasp of burns hand to drink whisky with john wilson to pat scott dogs to go to the theatre with lamb to listen to dsraeli the elder anecdotes to look on the lakes of westmoreland at the side of wordsworth and to ride through ur village in miss mitford pony chaise the first time we saw an author was an epoch it was in a church some one whispered just as the sermon began that a lady in the next pew was the writer of a moral tale then rated high in our little circle we did nothing the rest of the service but watch and speculate upon this to us wonderful personage we were disappointed at her everyay look and attire there was no fine frenzy in eye or gesture there she sat for all the world like any other lady ild quiet and attentive we were somewhat consoled by noting the extreme paleness of her complexion and a kind of abstraction in her gaze her habiliments were dark and faded in fact as we afterward discovered she was poor and her book had been printed by subscription thenceforth for a long time we imagined all female authors were dressed in black looked pensive and had no colour this illusion however was banished some years later when we were taken to a literary soir e where all the female authors were fat dressed in a variety of colours and instead of being melancholy had an overwhelming vivacity that made us realize how the type had changed by degrees we became enlightened and our authormania cooled in the first place we were shocked by seeing a pathetic writer whose universal tribute was tears in a flashy vest then we encountered a psychologist whose forte was sublimity enacting the part of a mendicant it was our misfortune to conduct a bard whose highlymaginative strain had often roused our aspirations home from a party in a state of inebriety one author we were prepared to love turned out a disagreeable egotist another wearied us by the exactions of his vanity a third repelled by intense affectation and a fourth by the bitterness of his comments one who had written only the most refined sentiment proved upon acquaintance an acute yankee one who had sung the beauty of nature we found to be an inveterate dandy and another whose expressed ideas betokened excess of delicacy grossly violated the ordinary instincts of gentle blood on one of our earliest visits to the illusive charm attached to the idea of a female author became indeed changed to a horror from which we have never wholly recovered we were requested to escort a lady to what we understood was an ordinary social gathering after entering a rather small and somewhat obscure drawingoom saluting the hostess and taking the proffered seat we were struck with the formal arrangement of the company they formed an unbroken row along the walls of the room except at one end at which stood a table surmounted by an astral lamp and in an armhair beside it in studied attitude like one pos for a daguerreotype sat a woman of masculine proportions coarse features and hair between yellow and red which fell in unkempt masses down each side of her broad face she was clad in white muslin of an antiquated fashion we noticed that the guests cast looks partly of curiosity partly of uneasiness upon this herculean female who rolled her eyes occasionally and smiled on us all with a kind of complacent pity we ventured amidst the silence to ask our neighbour the name of the gigantic unknown she appeared extremely surprised at the very natural question hy don you know wee invited here to meet her and i assure you it is a rare privilege that is mrs jones the celebrated author of the affianced one at this moment a brisk little woman in the corner with accents slightly tremulous and a manner intended to be very nonchalant broke the uncomfortable hush of the room y dear mrs jones said she s one of your earliest and most fervent admirers allow me to inquire if your health does not suffer from the intense state of feeling in which you evidently write the amazonian novelist sighed t was funny to see that operation on so large a scale nd then in a voice so like the rougher sex that we began to think she was a man in disguise replied hen i reach the catastrophe of my stories it is not uncommon for me to faint dead away and as i always write in a room by myself it has happened more than once that i have been found stretched miserable and cold on the floor with a pen grasped in my fingers and the carpet littered with manuscript blotted with tears the siddonian pathos of this announcement sent a thrill round the circle glances of admiration and pity were thrown upon the selfmmolated victim at the shrine of letters and other inquiries were adventured which elicited equally impressive replies until the psychological throes of authorship articularly in the female gender the aspect of an experience combined of epilepsy and nightmare the tragic egotism of these revelations at length overcame our patience and leaving our fair companion to another escort we slipped out of the room a thundertorm had arisen the rain was pouring down in torrents upon the doorteps we encountered a very pale thin little man with an umbrella under his arm and a pair of overshoes in his hands as we passed he addressed us in a very meek and frightened voice lease sirs is there a party here es lease sirs is the celebrated mrs jones here es lease sirs do you think i could step into the entry i mr jones hastening to our lodgings in another metropolis at twilight we passed a dwarf standing on a threshold who leaped down and caught us by the arm eagerly pronouncing our name and requesting a moment interview he led the way to a little room lighted by a single candle closed the door and with a quivering impatience of gesture introduced himself we remembered his name at once he was the author of a feeble imitation of pope we never beheld such an ogre his little green eyes apeike limbs and expression indicative of sensitiveness and conceit in that lone and dusky cabinet were appalling from a cupboard he took down what we supposed to be a ledger and placing it on the table gave an emphatic slap to the worn brown cover here said he s garnered the labour of years i have heard of your enthusiasm for authors and i will read you specimens of a poem destined to see the light a twelvemonth hence listen it was an epic in blank verse reary monotonous and verbose his recitation was like the refrain of a bullrog it grated on the ear and made the nerves shrink the candle burned thick the air seemed mephitic and in a little while we were oppressed and fevered as by a glamour cast over our brain we looked toward the door and moved uneasily the green eye was cast fiercely up from the page and the tone of the deformed became malicious we had heard of his vindictive spirit and felt as if in the cave of an imp spellbound and helpless the complacent hardihood with which he read on made us inwardly frantic we thought of the fair being who waited for us at a neighbouring fireside of the free air we had quitted and we writhed under the infliction hours passed a numb halfnconscious sense of misery stole over us and still the little demon glared and spouted ords words words ow detestable seemed they then at last in a fit of desperation we clapped our hand to our forehead and murmuring something about a congestive tendency sprang up ran through the hall and out at the door and looking back after hurrying on a few yards beheld the dwarf with his enormous book clasped to his heart gazing after us with the implacable look of a disappointed savage literature is no more regulated by accident than nature lucky hits and the tricks of pencraft are as temporary as all other artificial expedients the authors truly remembered and loved are men in the best sense of the term the human the individual informs and stamps their books with an image or an effluence not born of will or mere ingenuity but emanating from the soul and this is the quality that endears and perpetuates their fame hence goldsmith is beloved milton reverenced and the grave of burns a ecca of the mind at the commencement of the last century there appeared in the london gazette the offer of a reward of fifty pounds for the discovery of a certain person thus described middleized spare man about forty years of age of a brown complexion and dark brown hair though he wears a wig having a hooked nose a sharp chin gray eyes and a large mouth this was daniel defoe the victim of partisan injustice for whose rights every schoolboy would fight now out of sheer gratitude to the author of robinson crusoe let the writers who debase authorship into a perversion of history a sickly medium for egotistical rhetoric a gross theft of antecedent labours a base vehicle for spite or a mechanical knack of bookaking realize that they are foredoomed to contempt and that character is as little disguised by types as by costume the genuine author is recognized at once his integrity is selfvident it was sunset on the arno far down the river over mountain ranges where snow yet lingered a warm tint half rose and half amethyst glowed along the horizon beside the low parapet that bordered the street people were loitering back from their afternoon promenade at the cascine here a priest there a soldier now an englishman on horseback and then a bearded artist sometimes an ovalaced contadina the broad brim of whose finelyoven straw hat flapped over his eyes of mellow jet and again a trig nurse with saxon ringlets dragging a petulant urchin along and over all these groups and figures was shed the beautiful smile of parting day and by them under graceful bridges flowed the turbid stream its volume doubled by the spring freshets i surveyed the panorama from an overhanging balcony where i stood awaiting the appearance of a friend upon whom i had called hearing a movement behind i stepped back into the salon and found a middleged gentleman seated on a divan near the window we exchanged salutations and began to converse he alluded in unexceptionable english to the beauty of the hour came here from geneva he said here i work n italy i recreate and it is wonderful how this country ministers to intellectual repose even by the very associations it excites we feel a dreamike relation with the past and enter readily for a time into the dolcearniente spirit of the people and then return to taskork invigorated and with new zest there was a bland selfossessed and paternal look about this chance acquaintance that insensibly won my confidence and respect he was the image of a wise and serene maturity his ample brow his strong physique his affable manner and kindly eye suggested experience intelligence and benignity i was certain that he was a philosopher of some kind and fancied him an optimist but the utter absence of pretension and the simple candour of his address gave no hint of a man of renown accordingly i soon found myself engaged in a most pleasant and to me instructive colloquy following up the hint he had thrown out i spoke of the difficulty of combining mental toil with health everting in my own mind to our american race of scholars a majority of whom are confirmed invalids h said he here is vast error on this subject be assured that we were intended for intellectual labour and that there is a way of making it subservient to health i will tell you a few rules founded on experience vary the kind of work et it be research one hour meditation another collation toay and revision toorrow do this on system give the first part of the day to the hardest study the afternoon to exercise and the evening to social intercourse let the mind be tasked when the brain is most vigorous hat is after sleep and woo the latter blessing not in the feverish hour of thought and emotion but after the gentle exercise of the mind which comes from pastime and friendliness i looked at the hale contented face of the speaker about whom no sign of nervous irritability or exhaustion was discoverable and asked myself what experience of mental toil could have led him to such inferences he looked like a temperate country gentleman or unambitious and welloo citizen he then spoke of the changes he observed upon each successive visit to italy of the climate of switzerland and the society of geneva then he referred to america divining at once that it was my country and exhibiting entire familiarity with all that had been accomplished there in literature he betrayed a keen sense of enjoyment recognized a genial influence in the scene before us and gradually infected me with that agreeable feeling only to be derived from what poor cowper used to call omfortable people i led him to speak of his own method of life which was one of the most philosophical order he considered occasional travel and prudent habits the best hygi ne for a man of sedentary pursuits and the great secret both of health and successful industry the absolute yielding up of one consciousness to the business and the diversion of the hour ever permitting the one to infringe in the least degree upon the other i felt an instinctive respect toward him but at the same time entirely at home in his company the gentleman and the scholar appeared to me admirably fused in without overlaying the man presently the friend we mutually expected came in and introduced me to sismondi i was fresh from his italian republics and literature of the south of europe and he realized my ideal of a humane and earnest historian quite in contrast with this tranquil and robust votary of letters was the appearance and manner of silvio pellico no one who has ever read the chronicle of his imprisonments can forget the gentle and aspiring nature just blooming into poetic development which by the relentless fiat of austrian tyranny was cut off in a moment from home intelligent companionship and graceful activity and subjected to the loneliness privation and torments of long and solitary confinement nor is the spirit in which he met the bitter reverse less memorable than its tragic detail ecorded with so much simplicity and borne with such loving faith when i arrived in turin he was still an object of espionage and it was needful to seek him with caution agreeably to instructions previously received i went to a caf near the strada alfieri just at nightfall and watched for the arrival of an abb remarkable for his manly beauty i handed him the card of a mutual friend and made known my wishes the next day he conducted me through several arcades and by many a group of nobleooking piedmontese soldiers to a gateway thence up a long flight of steps to a door at which he gave a significant knock in a few moments it was quietly opened he whispered to the old serva and we tarried in an antehamber until a diminutive figure in black appeared who received me with a pensive kindliness that to one acquainted with le mie prigioni was fraught with pathos i beheld in the pallor of that mild face and expanded brow and the purblind eyes the blight of a dungeon his manner was subdued and nervous and his very tones melancholy i was unprepared to find after years of liberty the effects of his experience so visible and felt almost guilty of profane curiosity in having thus intruded upon his cherished seclusion i had known other victims of the same infernal tyranny but they were men of sterner mould who had resisted their cruel fate by the force of will rather than the patience of resignation pellico very delicacy of organization barbed the arrows of persecution and when at length he was released loneliness hope deferred and mental torture had crushed the energy of his nature the sweetness of his autobiography was but the fragrance of the trampled flower unelastic ever again to rise up in its early beauty a smile lighted up his brooding expression when i told him of the deep sympathy his book had excited in america and he grasped my hand with momentary ardour but the man too plainly reflected the martyr the stifling air he breathed under the leads of venice and the damps of his spielberg cell seemed yet to weigh upon his soul no glimmer of the patriotic fire which beams from francesca da rimini no ray of the vivacious observation that beguiled his solitude and quickened his pen redeemed the hopeless air of the captive poet the shadow of the power he had braved yet lay on his form and face and only the solace of filial love and the consolations of religion gave hope to his existence that is but a vulgar idea of authorship which estimates its worth by the caprices of fashion or the prestige of immediate success like art its value is intrinsic there are books as there are pictures which do not catch the thoughtless eye and yet are the gems of the virtuoso the oracles of the philosopher and the consolations of the poet we love authors as we love individuals according to our latent affinities and the extent of the popular appreciation is no more a standard to us than the world estimate of our friend whose nature we have tested by faithful companionship and sympathetic intercourse he who has not the mental independence to be loyal to his own intellectual benefactors is as much a heathen as one who repudiates his natural kin indeed an honest soul clings more tenaciously to neglected merit in authors as in men there is a chivalry of taste as of manners doubtless lamb zest for the old english dramatists addison admiration of milton poetry and carlyle devotion to german favourites were all the more earnest and keen because they were ignored by their neighbours in the library an original mind is conscious of special and comparatively obscure friends as the lover of nature has his pet flower and the lover of art his favourite old master it is well to obey these decided idiosyncrasies they point like the diviningod to hidden streams peculiarly adapted to our refreshment i knew an old merchant that read no book except boswell johnson and a black and humpacked cook whose only imaginative feast was the arabian nights

of authorship to society varies with political influences and average culture the class of degraded penwrights so often alluded to by fielding the ferocious quarrels recorded of and by pope and johnson with critics and publishers are phases of literary life which if not extinct have become essentially modified with the progress of civilization yet a quite recent quarterly reviewer speaks of this class of men as kind of ticketfeave lunatics and modern experiences if less dark than old annals of grub street include some quite as remarkable instances of reckless extravagance in prosperity and barbarous neglect in adversity the bohemian class is confined to no epoch or country yet charming is the group of authors that illustrate and signalize every period of british history n

chatterton milton or burke realized in rehearsing their personal cognizance of these famous authors such is the instinctive attraction of congenial or eminent authorship if this subject were nomenclated and analyzed in the naturalistic way there is scarcely a sphere of humanity or a form of character which might not be identified with or illustrated by authorship the mad the mendicant the charlatan ombative contemplative heroic and sybarite re but a few of the varieties which literary biography reveals their amours diseases profits calamities triumphs quarrels personal tastes and habits domestic life and most individual traits and fortunes have been minutely recorded so as to form on the whole the best and most accessible psychological cabinet for the student of human nature

hunt and montgomery have a pathetic charm which no other record of captivity boasts even the selfelusions of authors awaken a considerate interest the mistaken judgment of petrarch and milton in regard to the comparative merit of their writings and the exaggerated estimate of their own verses by such able statesmen as frederic and richelieu tend to enhance the mysteries of the craft and sanction its illusions but it must be confessed that the romance of authorship is fast disappearing in its reality so numerous have become the votaries of a once rare pursuit so common the renown so universal the practice that the individual and characteristic the curious and interesting elements thereof are more and more merged in the commonplace and familiar a distinction has often been insisted on between the critical and the creative in literature but modern criticism in its best development is essentially reproductive so intimate deep and affluent is its dealing with authors that they often are restored in all their vital worth and the process has endeared such writers as lamb hazlitt carlyle arnold and st beuve as true intellectual benefactors such philosophical and sthetic interpreters of authorship have engendered an eclectic appreciation and enjoyment of authors and made us what allston calls ide likers hence the prevalence and promise of what may be called a cosmopolitan in distinction to a provincial taste whereby we learn to value the greatest diversities of style subject and character in literature fastidious and severely disciplined minds indeed coldly ignore certain authors and warmly espouse others but to a spirit at once generous and cultivated sympathetic and intelligent though a special charm will invest favourite authors all of the fraternity who are genuine have a recognized claim to grateful recognition and even the unequal and incongruous development of modern english literature incident to the absence of what matthew arnold calls ny centre of intelligent and urbane spirit like the french academy desirable as such a discipline and standard is in quelling eccentricity and incorrectness the free and energetic development the honest though sometimes rude exercise of authorship in our vernacular is no small compensation we confess a partiality for the richlyiversified phases of mental life thus induced n eclectic relish for the varieties of national and personal characteristics the artistic french the meditative german the practical english writers have each their attraction and use the desultory style of richter the quaint individuality of lamb the verbose dignity of johnson the mosaic finish of gray the grotesque eloquence of carlyle the flowing rhetoric of macaulay wordsworth pastoral isolation scott feudal enthusiasm byron intense consciousness shelley disinterested idealism the homely images of crabbe and the sensuous luxury of keats are all in their way and at times accordant with our mental wants congenial to our receptive moods why should not we tolerate and enjoy the various elements of literature as fully and fondly as those of nature and society does it not argue a narrowness of mind inconsistent with genuine intellectual and moral health to perversely confine our appreciation of authorship to certain schools forms and individuals are not the philosophical the piquant the earnest the playful the solemn gay impressive winsome acute wise and humorous traits and triumphs of written thought as legitimate in their infinite variety as means of human culture discipline and pleasure as the myriad tints and tones of nature and the diversities of character and manners a true lover of authors will not only find something to enjoy and appropriate in the most diverse forms of expression and qualities of genius both in the literature of power and in that of knowledge as finely discriminated by de quincey but will separate the inspired and the journeyman work of each author and do justice to what is genuine while repudiating the conventional if what go the maintained is literally true and genuine authorship is the reflex of consciousness upon outward life then all its spontaneous products must have a vital element of human life love and truth more or less congenial to all readers of candid clear and humane instincts for we agree with a liberal and acute critic when he says that the gift of literary genius ies in the faculty of being happily inspired by a certain intellectual and spiritual atmosphere y a certain order of ideas of dealing divinely with these ideas presenting them in the most effective and attractive combinations making beautiful works of them it is a new and glorious era in our experience of books when the vital significance of authorship is heartily realized dilletantism excusable in the novice gives place to the worship of truth to write for the mere sake of writing to amuse with the pen becomes in our estimation what it is thing of less interest than the most simple and familiar phenomena of nature as life reveals itself and character matures we long above all for reality we perceive that growth is our welfare and that earnestness faith and new truth are the only joy of a manly intellect then we read to nerve our moral energies to extend the scope of perception and to deepen the experience of the soul the butterflies of literature allure no longer the imitators we pass by but the deep thinkers the original the brave lead us on to explore analyze and conquer iterature says schlegel to the spirit in which it is pursued is an infamy a pastime a dry labour a handicraft an art a science a virtue and this diversity is true not only of authors in general but sometimes of the same individual many a poet whose early utterance was inspired has degenerated into a hack a truckster and a mercenary penman and many a youthful dabbler in letters by some deep experience has been matured into the bold advocate or heroic pioneer in the world of thought we soon learn heartily to sympathize with one of the unfortunate originals of go the werther and declare with him have resolved in future to take good care how i write anything to an author save what all the world may see only extending the prudential resolve to conversation or whatever advance has been made in refinement in the use of language in the abuse of confidence modern writers are so destitute of scruples that the sanctities of life and social intercourse have no greater or more profane intruder than the author nor is the eart of courtesy the only high quality risked by the vocation it almost seems in vain and unchivalric natures to sap manhood itself some one has said he man who has learned to read has lost one portion of his courage if he writes verses he has lost a double portion there is a fatal fluency an arrogant expressiveness whereby the robust and honest material of character is as it were evaporated in words for nothing characterizes the genuine author more than a reticent tone an integrity of utterance which makes it apparent that his authorship instead of a graft is a growth of his best humanity so proverbial is the social barrenness of the craft in its average conventional scope that a facetious florentine barber in one of the best of modern historical novels romola is quite appropriately made to say am sorely afraid that the good wine of my understanding is going to run off at the spigot of authorship and i shall be left an empty cask with an odour of dregs like many other incomparable geniuses of my acquaintance all meanness is disenchanting but selfish economy of intellectual treasures and egotistical insensibility to the merit of others not only robs the author of all sympathetic charm but almost invariably signalizes his essential mediocrity or unfounded pretensions under the two diverse aspects of an inspiration and a career authorship thus offers the extremes of attraction and antagonism to candid and earnest souls if the spontaneous gift and charm of the former are justly endeared to all lovers of humanity the artificial conditions worldly motives and forced relations of the latter often dispel the illusions of fame in the realities of vulgar notoriety and mercenary zeal we can well understand how a reverent delicate and true nature like maurice de gu rin shrinks from professional authorship when the original beauty and truth of his utterances led his friends to urge that vocation upon him he literary career he writes to me unreal both in its own essence and in the rewards one seeks from it and therefore fatally marred by a secret absurdity at this moment our vernacular is the only tongue in which men can express themselves fearlessly it appropriately enshrines the literature of freedom we seldom realize this noble distinction of the english language i was halfsleep one afternoon in the cabin of a steamer in the bay of naples when suddenly the violent pitching of the vessel ceased and i hastened on deck to learn the reason of the change and found to my surprise that we were returning into the harbour the captain having decided that it was too great a risk to venture to sea in such a gale pleasant as was the transition from tossing waves to smooth water every traveller in that region who has gone through the business of a departure he passport signatures the tussle with porters drivers and boatmen the leaveakings packingps directions at postffice and banker an embarkation in the midst of cries rushings to and fro disputes for gratuities beggars missing baggage attempts to secure a berth wringing of hands waving of handkerchiefs and it may be embraces at parting very traveller cognizant of this experience will understand how vexatious it was within an hour after this tantalizing process to find one self in travelling costume once more in the city for the afternoon with no lodging no appointment and no sighteeing to do i was not long in resolving to visit once more my old dininglace the corona ferro at the opposite table to that at which i was seated appeared a handsome young man with a dark intelligent eye and a bearing indicative of spirit and courtesy seeing me hesitate over the carte he suggested a dish which had proved molto buono that day and having followed the kindly counsel we engaged in a desultory chat about the weather the opera the last news from france and by the time dessert came on had established quite a pleasant understanding at length he made an inquiry based upon the idea that he was addressing an englishman i corrected the error and his politeness at once warmed into enthusiasm at the discovery that he was talking with an american after dinner he invited me to his apartments i found the sittingoom adorned with pictures and littered with books having ordered coffee we were soon engaged in a serious discussion of literary subjects in which my new friend proved a tasteful votary he wished for a definite statement as to the extent of the liberty of the press in the united states i explained it and he became highly excited paced the room quoted alfieri sighed pressed his brow and at length flung himself into a chair declaring that if it were not for kindred who had claims upon him he would emigrate at once to america to account for his feelings he showed me a pile of mss the publication of which had been prohibited by the government censors on account of their liberal sentiment he then exhibited several beautiful poems founded on scientific truths yet mystically involving great and humane principles ruse he had been compelled to resort to in order to express publicly his opinions as i recognized the evidences of genius watched his chafed mood and noted his manly spirit i felt deeply the crushing influence of despotism upon authorship and realized the natural antagonism between poets and kings there is no greater fallacy than that involved in the notion of an essential diversity between an author and his books professed opinions do not reveal the truth of character but unconscious phases of style habits of thought and tones of expression like what is called natural language make us thoroughly acquainted with the man is not jeremy taylor religious sentiment manifest in the very method of his utterance can we not see at a glance the improvidence and the fascination of sheridan in the tenor of his plays who would not avouch the honesty of john stephens after reading his travels what reverent heart is not magnetized by the genuineness of devotion in watts however crudely expressed is not prudence signified in the very style of franklin are we not braced with the selfonfident frankness of cooper in the spirit as well as the characters of his nautical and forest tales critics betray their arrogant temper under the most courteous phrases a gentleman is still a gentleman and a puppy a puppy on paper as in life the sham and the true are equally discernible in print and in society montaigne exhibits his worldly wisdom as plainly in his essays as he ever did in his acts it is not therefore the insidious but the obvious perils of authorship that threaten the novice lamentable is it to see mediocre men take up as a vocation either literature or art for in both a certain amount of character alone insures respectability and this is less requisite in pursuits that do not so openly challenge observation one day i was told a gentleman had called and waited for me in the drawingoom as i entered he was gazing from the window in the shadow of a damask curtain which threw a warm tint upon as strongly moulded a face as i remembered to have seen in one so young his forehead was compactly rounded his hair curly and raven and his eye dark and luminous as i approached he handed me a note of introduction from a friend refused the proffered seat and wore so earnest and grave an expression that i almost thought he was the bearer of a challenge ir he began have come to you for sympathy in a great undertaking i wish to be cheered in a mission encouraged in a career advised in an experiment there was a certain wildness in the manner of this sententious address which breathed of an excited fancy i expressed a willingness to aid him to the extent of my humble ability he drew a thick packet from his coat and proceeded am a native of a little village in a neighbouring state my father is an agriculturist and has endeavoured to render me content with that lot but there is something here nd he laid a large red hand on his capacious breast hat rebels against the decree i aspire to the honours of literature i long to utter myself to the world here is a tragedy and some lyrics and i have come to town to test my fortune as an author i saw that he was an enthusiast and calmly pointed out the obstacles to success he became impatient i enlarged on the healthfulness and wisdom of a country life on the precarious subsistence incident to pencraft his eye flashed with anger i urged him to consider well the risk he incurred the danger of failure the advantages of a reliable vocation the comfort of an independent though secluded existence he advanced toward me with an indignant stride ir he exclaimed have been misinformed you are not the man i took you for farewell for ever and he rushed from the house six months had elapsed and i was sitting over a book in my quiet room one day when a terrific knock at the door aroused me and an instant after the stranger entered and impetuously grasped my hand ir y dear friend i mean e said have done you injustice and i have come to apologize for a month after my former interview i passed a feverish novitiate hawking my manuscripts around deceived by plausible members of the trade snubbed by managers frozen out of the sanctums of editors yawned at by casual audiences baffled at every turn until worn out mortified and despairing i went home the feel of the turf the breath of the wind the lowing of the kine the very scent of hay was refreshing i thought over your counsel and found it true i now farm the paternal acres on shares write verses during the long winter evenings lead the choir on sundays am to marry the pride of the village next week and am here to beg your pardon and invite you to my wedding the delectable quality of authorship is its impersonality consider a moment the privilege and the immunity if we address a multitude or an individual the impression may be pleasing or wearisome but courtesy requires that it be endured with equanimity a book is unobtrusive silent objective it can be taken up or let alone in it if genuine there is a thought that craves hospitality to be caught in a favourable mood as the fallow hillock receives the seed borne on the vagrant wind it may take root and the originator thereof has unconsciously given birth to an undying impulse or yielded spiritual refreshment the whole process is like that of nature nostentatious benign and of inestimable benefit and yet how latent beyond observation secreted in consciousness all power of expression hether by means of pen colour or chisel artistic development is but a new vocabulary that reveals character the author and the artist differ from their less gifted fellows simply in this hat they have more language the endowment does not change their natures if coarse artificial vain f brave truthful or shallow hey thus appear in books and marble or on canvas and hence it is that character is the true gauge of authorship and wins or repels confidence respect and love in the same proportion as do living men y their fruit shall ye know them therefore authors themselves most effectually disenchant readers they are disloyal to their high mission they compromise their own ideal write gossip instead of truth describe themselves instead of nature dip their pens in the venom of malevolence corrupt their style with vulgarity keep no faith with aspiration truckle to power and interest and so bring their vocation itself into merited disdain how charming on the other hand is the spontaneous bard who sings from an overflowing and musical nature there is a court in one of the most populous quarters of london which rejoices in the name of spring gardens doubtless the spot at one time was a rural domain at present a few trees peering over a wall and a retired and quaint look about some of the brick domiciles that line the street alone justify the pleasant name it bears in one of these houses is the office of the commissioners of lunacy and there one winter morning i had the satisfaction of a brief t te te with procter his plainlyut frockoat long and black his white hair and quiet bearing made him appear a curate such as goldsmith portrayed it is a curious vocation for a poet hat of testing the wits of people suspected of being out of their mind nd a painful one for a sensitive nature to inspect the asylums devoted to their use but i remembered that procter early taste drew him into intimate love and recognition of the old english dramatists whose natural element was the terrible in human passion and woe i considered the profound tenderness of his muse and i felt that even the tragic scenes it was his duty to witness and to study were not without a certain sad affinity with genius kean visited madhouses to perfect his conception of lear and he who sings of human weal and sorrow is taught to deepen and hallow his strain by the misery as well as the amenities of his life the heart of courtesy the mood of aspiration have not been quelled in procter by the stern professional business which is his daily task they loomed up even in that dusky office and kept faith with my previous ideal but it was especially in the poet eye that i read the spirit of his muse ineffably mild and tender is its expression deepening under the influence of emotion like the tremulous cadence of music that is born of sentiment i saw there the soul that dictated ow many summers love hast thou been mine end down thy pitying angel god and so many other lays of affection endeared to all who can appreciate the genuine lyrics of the heart identified with the name of barry cornwall with all its occasional disenchantment my love of authors imparted a singular charm to the experience of travel the lapse of time and new localities united then to revive the dreams of youth what a new grace the first view of the hills of spain derived from the memory of cervantes and the gleanings in that romantic field of lockhart and irving how

had laid the dust freshened the leaves and purified as well as cooled the sultry air attracted by the sweet breath and vivid tints of the landscape i determined to walk to a steamboatanding four miles off and on my way make a longeditated visit to sunnyside taking an umbrageous path that wound through a shady lane i sauntered along sometimes in view of the crystal expanse of tappan zee sometimes catching a glimpse of the hoary and tufted palisades and again pausing under a majestic elm on whose pendent spray a yellowird chirped and swung or from whose dense green canopy a locust trilled its drowsy note the breeze was scented with clover and woodbine sleek cattle grazed in the meadows amber clouds flecked a heaven of azure fields of grain waved like a shoreless lake of plumes the maize stood thick and tasselled the lofty chestnuts shook their feathery bloom now and then a solitary crow hovered above or a brown robin hopped cheerily by the wayside it was one of those clear serene luxurious days of early summer which in our capricious climate occasionally unite the gorgeous hues of the orient with the balm and the softness of italy pearly outlines stretched along the hills the broad river gleamed in sunshine and every shade of emerald flashed or deepened over the wide groves and teeming farms as i drew near to irving cottage the bees were contentedly humming round the locusts and the ivyeaves that clustered thickly about the old gables were dripping with the tears of night every bugle of the honeysuckle was a delicate censer and the turf and hedge wore their brightest colours even the old weathercock trophy of an ancient colonial stadtouse dazzled the eye as it caught the lateral rays of the sun the fowls strutted about with unwonted complacency and the houseog bounded through the beaded grass as if exhilarated by the scene on the veranda that overlooks the river from which it is divided by a little grove sat our favourite author with a book on his knee the embodiment of thoughtful content his home looked the symbol of his genius and his expression the reflex of his life they harmonized with a rare completeness and fulfilled to the heart the

new french meute and that led us to speak of the first revolution and irving gave some impressive reminiscences of his visits to the localities of paris which are identified with those scenes of violence and blood he recurred to them with keen sensibility and in graphic details it was delightful thus to commune with a man whose name was associated with my first conscious relish of native authorship and detect the same moral zest and picturesque insight in his talk which so long ago had endeared his writings i felt anew the conservative power of a love of nature and an artistic organization they had kept thus fresh the sympathies and thus enjoyable the mind retirement was as grateful now as when he sought it as a juvenile dreamer the noble river won as fond a glance as when first explored as a truant urchin and the kindly spirit beamed as truly in his smile as when he mused in the alhambra or walked to melrose with scott for a cicerone my authormania revived in all its original fervour here were the mellow hues on the picture that beguiled my boyhood and the man the scene and the author blended in a graceful unity of effect without a single incongruity pictures on this picture and on this amlet it is not surprising that pictures with all their attraction for eye and mind are to many honest and intelligent people too much of a riddle to be altogether pleasant what with the oracular dicta of selfonstituted arbiters of taste the discrepancies of popular writers on art the jargon of connoisseurship the vagaries of fashion the endless theories about colour style chiaroscuro composition design imitation nature schools painting has become rather a subject for the gratification of vanity and the exercise of pedantic dogmatism than a genuine source of enjoyment and culture of sympathy and satisfaction ike music literature scenery and other recognized intellectual recreations in these latter spheres it is not thought presumptuous to assert and enjoy individual taste the least independent talkers will bravely advocate their favourite composer describe the landscape which has charmed or the book which has interested them but when a picture is the subject of discussion few have the moral courage to say what they think there is a selfistrust of one own impressions and even convictions in regard to what is represented on canvas that never intervenes between thought and expression where ideas or sentiments are embodied in writing or in melody nor is this to be ascribed wholly to the technicalities of pictorial art in which so few are deeply versed but in a great measure to the incongruous and irrelevant associations which have gradually overlaid and mystified a subject in itself as open to the perception of a candid mind and healthy senses as any other department of human knowledge half the want of appreciation of pictures arises from ignorance not of the principles of art but of the elements of nature good observers are rare the peasant criticism upon moreland armyard hat three pigs never eat together without one foot at least in the trough as a strict inference from personal knowledge of the habits of the animal so the surgeon found a head of the baptist untrue because the skin was not withdrawn somewhat from the line of decollation these and similar instances show that some knowledge of or interest in the thing

tapestries are hints of what is essential in the progress and the triumphs of painting considered as a language how definitely is the style of painters associated with special forms of character and spheres of life here certainly never was a painter says a traveller in spain of murillo ho without much imagination and telling no story could yet vision his eyes with such pure love and make lips so parting with prayer as murillo himself a father he loved to paint the childaviour in conjunction with thinaced saints it is this variety of human experience typified and illustrated on canvas that forms our chief obligations to the artist through him our perception of and acquaintance with our race ts individuality and career its phases and aspects re indefinitely enlarged he greatest benefit says a late writer e owe to the artist whether painter poet or novelist is the extension of our sympathies art is the nearest thing to life it is a mode of amplifying our experience and extending our contact with our fellowreatures beyond the bounds of our personal lot room with pictures in it and a room without pictures says an sthetic essayist iffer by nearly as much as a room with windows and a room without windows nothing we think is more melancholy particularly to a person who has to pass much time in his room than blank walls with nothing on them for pictures are loopholes of escape to the soul leading it to other spheres it is such an inexpressible relief to the person engaged in writing or even reading on looking up not to have his line of vision chopped square off by an odious white wall but to find his soul escaping as it were through the frame of an exquisite picture to other beautiful and perhaps idyllic scenes where the fancy for a moment may revel refreshed and delighted is it winter in your world perhaps it is summer in the picture what a charming momentary change and contrast and thus pictures are consolers of loneliness they are a sweet flattery to the soul they are a relief to the jaded mind they are windows to the imprisoned thought they are books they are histories and sermons hich we can read without the trouble of turning over the leaves the effect of a picture is increased by isolation and surprise i never realized the physiognomical traits of madame de maintenon until her portrait was encountered in a solitary countryouse of whose drawingoom it was the sole ornament and the romance of a miniature by malbone first came home to me when an ancient dame in the costume of the last century with trembling fingers drew one of her husband from an antique cabinet and descanted on the manly beauty of the deceased original and the graceful genius of the young and lamented artist hazlitt wrote an ingenious essay on a portrait by vandyke which gives us an adequate idea of what such a masterpiece is to the eye and mind of genuine artistic perception and sympathy few sensations or rather sentiments are more inextricably made up of pleasure and sadness than that with which we contemplate as is not infrequent in some old gallery of europ a portrait which deeply interests or powerfully attracts us and whose history is irrevocably lost a better homily on the evanescence of human love and fame can scarcely be imagined a face alive with moral personality and human charms such as win and warm our stranger eyes yet the name subject artist owner all lost in oblivion to pause before an interesting but nknown portrait is to read an elegy as pathetic as gray the mechanical processes by which nature is so closely imitated and the increase of which during the last few years is one of the most remarkable facts in science may at the first glance appear to have lessened the marvellous in art by making available to all the exact representation of stillife but when duly considered the effect is precisely the reverse for exactly in proportion as we become familiar with the mechanical production of the similitudes of natural and artificial objects do we instinctively demand higher powers of conception greater spiritual expression in the artist the discovery of daguerre and its numerous improvements and the unrivalled precision attained by photography render exact imitation no longer a miracle of crayon or palette these must now create as well as reflect invent and harmonize as well as copy bring out the soul of the individual and of the landscape or their achievements will be neglected in favour of the facimiles obtainable through sunshine and chemistry the best photographs of architecture statuary ruins and in some cases of celebrated pictures are satisfactory to a degree which has banished mediocre sketches and even minutelyinished but literal pictures specimens of what is called aturerinting which gives an impression directly from the veined stone the branching fern or the seaoss are so true to the details as to answer a scientific purpose natural objects are thus lithographed without the intervention of pencil or ink and these several discoveries have placed the results of mere imitative art within reach of the mass in other words her prose language hat which mechanical science can utter s so universal that her poetry hat which must be conceived and expressed through individual genius the emanation of the soul s more distinctly recognized and absolutely demanded from the artist in order to vindicate his claim to that title than ever before perhaps indeed the scope which painting offers to experimental individual and prescriptive taste the loyalty it invokes from the conservative the nfinite possibilities it offers to the imaginative the intimacy it promotes with nature and character are the cause of so much originality and attractiveness in its votaries the lives of painters abound in the characteristic the adventurous and the romantic open vasari walpole or cunningham at random and one is sure to light upon something odd genial or exciting one of the most popular novelists of our day assured me that in his opinion the richest unworked vein for his craft available in these days of civilized uniformity is artistife at rome to one thoroughly cognizant of its humours and aspirations its interiors and vagrancies its selfenials and its resources i have sometimes imagined what a story the old white dog who so long frequented the epri and the aff greco and attached himself so capriciously to the brother artists of his deceased master could have told if blessed with memory and language he had tasted the freedom and the zest of artistife in rome and scorned to follow trader or king he preferred the odour of canvas and oil to that of conservatories and had more frolic and dainty morsels at an al fresco of the painters in the campagna than the kitchen of an italian prince could furnish his very name betokened good cheer and was pronounced after the manner of the pert waiters who complacently enunciate a few words of english bifteck was a privileged dog and though occasionally made the subject of a practical joke taught absurd tricks sent on fools errands and his white coat painted like a zebra these were but casual troubles he was a sensible dog to despise them when he could enjoy such quaint companionship behold such experiments in colour and drawing serve as a model himself and go on delicious sketching excursions to albano and tivoli besides inhaling tobaccomoke and hearing stale jests and love soliloquies ad infinitum i am of bifteck opinion there is no such true earnest humorous and individual life in these days of high civilization as that of your genuine painter impoverished as it often is baffled in its aspirations unregarded by the material and the worldly it often rears and keeps pure bright genial natures whose contact brings back the dreams of youth it is pleasant too to realize in a great commercial city that man oes not live by bread alone that fun is better than furniture and a private resource of nature more prolific of enjoyment than financial investments it is rare comfort here in the land of bustle and sunshine to sit in a tempered light and hear a man sing or improvise stories over his work to behold once more vagaries of costume to let the eye rest upon pictorial fragments of italy he ld familiar faces of roman models the endeared outlines of apennine hills the contadina bodice and the brigand hat until these objects revive to the heart all the romance of travel vernet sympathies were excited by the misfortunes of a worthy tradesman of marseilles and he attended the sheriff auction at the bankrupt house where among the crowd he recognized a woulde connoisseur in art of ample wealth the painter fixed his eyes upon a dim and mediocre picture on the wall and bid fifteen francs immediately the rich amateur scented a prize a long contest ensued and at length the picture was knocked off to vernet antagonist for so large a sum that the honest bankrupt was enabled to pay his creditors in full and recommence business with a handsome capital with the progress of civilization pictures have grown in permanent market value a quaker who incurred the reproach of his brethren for securing a wouverman for a large sum was excused for this anity by his shrewd friends when he demonstrated to them that he had made an excellent investment literature affords many illustrations of the romance of the pictorial art of which among our own authors allston and hawthorne have given memorable examples in monaldi and twiceold tales unknown portraits have inspired the most attractive conjectures and about the best known and most fascinating hover an atmosphere of intensely personal interest or historical association vasari mrs jameson hazlitt and other artriters have elaborated the most delectable facts and fancies from this vast individual sphere of the picturesque the technicalities of art its refinements of style its absolute significance are indeed as dependent for appreciation on a special endowment as are mathematics but the general and incidental associations in which is involved a world of poetry may be enjoyed to the full extent by those whose perception of form sense of colour and knowledge of the principles of sculpture painting music and architecture are notably deficient it is a law of life and nature that truth and beauty adequately represented create and diffuse a limitless element of wisdom and pleasure such memorials are talismanic and their influence is felt in all the higher and more permanent spheres of thought and emotion they are the gracious landmarks that guide humanity above the commonplace and the material along the ine of infinite desires art in its broad and permanent meaning is a language he language of sentiment of character of national impulse of individual genius and for this reason it bears a lesson a charm or a sanction to all ven to those least versed in its rules and least alive to its special triumphs sir walter scott was no amateur yet through his reverence for ancestry and his local attachments portraiture and architecture had for him a romantic interest sydney smith was impatient of galleries when he could talk with men and women and made a practical joke of buying pictures yet newton and leslie elicited his best humour talfourd cared little and knew less of the treasures of the louvre but lingered there because it had been his friend hazlitt elysium indeed there are constantly blended associations in the history of english authors and artists reynolds is identified with johnson and goldsmith smibert with berkeley barry with burke constable and wilkie with sir george beaumont haydon with wordsworth and leslie with irving the painters depict their friends of the pen the latter celebrate in verse or prose the artist triumphs and both intermingle thought and sympathy and from this contact of select intelligences of diverse vocation has resulted the choicest wit and the most genial companionship if from special we turn to general associations from biography to history the same prolific affinities are evident whereby the artist becomes an interpreter of life and casts the halo of romance over the stern features of reality hampton court is the almost breathing society of charles the second reign the bodleian gallery is vivid with britain past intellectual life the history of france is pictured on the walls of versailles the luxury of colour bred by the sunsets of the euganean hills the waters of the adriatic the marbles of san marco and the skies and atmosphere

normal type and suggestive exemplar to the imagination a chapter of romance a sequestration and initial token of the characteristic and the historical either of what has become traditional or what is for ever true the indirect service good artists have rendered by educating observation has yet to be acknowledged the venetian painters cannot be even superficially regarded without developing the sense of colour nor the roman without enlarging our cognizance of expression nor the english without refining our perception of the evanescent effects in scenery raphael has made infantile grace

unfold a tale in reference to their best acquisitions which outvies fiction beckford tablealk abounded in such reminiscences an american artist who had resided long in italy and made a study of old pictures caught sight at a shop window in new orleans of an homo so pathetic in expression as to arrest his steps and engross his attention upon inquiry he learned that it had been purchased of a soldier fresh from mexico after the late war between that country and the united states he bought it for a trifle carried it to europe and soon authenticated it as an original guercino painted for the royal chapel in madrid and sent thence by the government to a church in mexico whence after centuries it had found its way through the accidents of war to a pawnbroker shop in louisiana a lady in one of our eastern cities wishing to possess as a memorial some article which had belonged to a deceased neighbour and not having the means at the public sale of her effects to bid for an expensive piece of furniture contented herself with buying for a few shillings a familiar chimneycreen one day she discovered a glistening surface under the flowered paper which covered it and when this was torn away there stood revealed a picture of acob and rachel at the well by paul veronese doubtless thus concealed with a view to its secret removal during the first french revolution the missing charles first of velasquez was lately exhibited in this country and the account its possessor gives of the mode of its discovery and the obstacles which attended the establishment of its legal ownership in england is a remarkable illustration both of the tact of the connoisseur and the mysteries of jurisprudence political vicissitudes not only cause pictures to emigrate like their owners but to change their costume f we may so call a frame ith equal celerity that which now encloses peale washington at princeton once held the portrait of george the third and there is an elaborate old frame which holds the likeness of a new england poet grandfather whence was hurriedly taken the portrait of governor hutchinson in anticipation of a domiciliary visit from the ons of liberty there is scarcely indeed an artist or a patron of art of any eminence who has not his own tory of a picture like all things of beauty and of fame the very desire of possession which a painting excites and the interest it awakens give rise to some costly sacrifice or incidental circumstance which associates the prize with human fortune and sentiment a friend of mine in exploring the more humble class of boardingouses in one of our large commercial towns in search of an unfortunate relation found himself while expecting the landlady absorbed in a portrait on the walls of a dingy back parlour the furniture was of the most common description a few smutched and faded annuals halfovered with dust lay on the centreable beside an oldashioned astral lamp a cracked porcelain vase of waxlowers a yellow satin pincushion embroidered with tarnished goldace and an album of venerable hue filled with hyperbolic apostrophes to the charms of some ancient beauty which with the dilapidated windowurtains the obsolete sideboard the wooden effigy of a redaced man with a spyglass under his arm and the cracked alabaster clockase on the mantel all bespoke an impoverished establishment so devoid of taste that the beautiful and artistic portrait seemed to have found its way there by a miracle it represented a young and spirituelle woman in the costume so elegant in material and formal in mode which copley has immortalized in this instance however there was a french look about the coiffure and robe the eyes were bright with intelligence chastened by sentiment the features at once delicate and spirited and altogether the picture was one of those visions of blended youth grace sweetness and intellect from which the fancy instinctively infers a tale of love genius or sorrow according to the mood of the spectator subdued by his melancholy errand and discouraged by a long and vain search my friend whose imagination was quite as excitable as his taste was correct soon wove a romance around the picture it was evidently not the work of a novice it was as much out of place in this obscure and inelegant domicile as a diamond set in filigree or a rose among pigweed how came it there who was the original what her history and her fate her parentage and her nurture must have been refined she must have inspired love in the chivalric perchance this was the last relic of an illustrious exile the last memorial of a princely house this reverie of conjecture was interrupted by the entrance of the landlady my friend had almost forgotten the object of his visit and when his anxious inquiries proved vain he drew the loquacious hostess into general conversation in order to elicit the mystery of the beautiful portrait she was a robust grayaired woman with whose constitutional goodature care had waged a long and partially successful war that indescribable air which speaks of better days was visible at a glance the remnants of bygone gentility were obvious in her dress she had the peculiar manner of one who had enjoyed social consideration and her language indicated familiarity with cultivated society yet the anxious expression habitual to her countenance and the bustling air of her vocation which quickly succeeded conversational repose hinted but too plainly straitened circumstances and daily toil but what struck her present curious visitor more than these casual traits were the remains of great beauty in the still lovely contour of the face the refined lines of her mouth and the depth and varied play of the eyes he was both sympathetic and ingenious and ere long gained the confidence of his auditor the unfeigned interest and the true perception he manifested in speaking of the portrait rendered him in its owner estimation worthy to know the story his own intuition had so nearly divined the original was theodosia the daughter of burr his affection for her was the redeeming fact of his career and character both were anomalous in our history in an era remarkable for patriotic selfacrifice he became infamous for treasonable ambition among a phalanx of statesmen illustrious for directness and integrity he pursued the tortuous path of perfidious intrigue in a community where the sanctities of domestic life were unusually revered he bore the stigma of unscrupulous libertinism with the blood of his gallant adversary and his country idol on his hands the penalties of debt and treason hanging over him the fertility of an acute intellect wasted on vain expedients n outlaw an adventurer a plausible reasoner with one sex and fascinating betrayer of the other poor bereaved contemned ne holy loyal sentiment lingered in his perverted soul ove for the fair gifted gentle being who called him father the only disinterested sympathy his letters breathe is for her and the feeling and sense of duty they manifest offer a remarkable contrast to the parallel record of a life of unprincipled schemes misused talents and heartless amours as if to complete the tragic antithesis of destiny the beloved and gifted woman who thus shed an angelic ray upon that dark career was soon after her father return from europe lost in a storm at sea while on her way to visit him thus meeting a fate which even at this distance of time is remembered with pity her wretched father bore with him in all his wanderings and through all his remorseful exile her picture mblem of filial

the paradox of ruskin beautiful rhetoric haydon suicidal devotion to the rand style mrs jameson gracious exposition of religious art and the extravagant encomiums which the fashionable painter of the hour elicits from accredited critical journals indicate the antagonistic theories and tastes that prevail and yet these are all authentic and recognized oracles of artistic knowledge more or less true

of deception is the very name of a pictureealer that to the multitude an ld master is a bugbear he tricks of this trade form a staple of paris correspondents and travelled raconteurs the details of manufacture in perhaps this most lucrative branch of spurious traffic are patent and although the legitimate products of worldenowned painters are authenticated and on record scarcely a month passes without some extensive fraud the amateur in literature sculpture and music is comparatively free from this perpetual danger the sense of mystery does not baffle his enthusiasm and while the pictorial votary or victim is disputing about an ndrea del sarto or a eniers or bewildered by the conflicting theories of rival artists in regard to colour tone composition foreshortening chiaroscuro he enjoys

derivable from these anomalous results of ictures is that we should rely upon our individual impressions enjoy what appeals gratefully to our consciousness repudiate hackneyed and conventional terms judgments and affectations and boldly declare with the poet before the picture which enchants us leave to learned fingers and wise hands the artist and his ape to teach and tell how well his

memory and imagination so familiar through engravings cameos and other reproductive forms of art and so identified with tragic experience ideal aspiration or heroic deeds that the first view of the originals is an epoch in life we seem to behold them down a limitless vista of time and they appeal to our consciousness like the faces of the longoved longost and suddenly restored it is as if we had

victim with the passion of youth and the fancy of a painter one of the courageous but inadequate band who conspired to rescue her at the scaffold and it was long believed that he died of indignant grief after the catastrophe imagine him with the shadow of that mighty sorrow upon his soul his hand inspired by tender recollection secluded with her image stamped on his broken heart and patiently reproducing those delicate features and that anguished expression is last offering to her he so quickly followed into the valley of death his tudy fell into the hands of maffei barberini and furnished guido reni the materials for this his most effective and endeared creation its marvellous almost magnetic expression doubtless gave rise to the belief so long current that he sketched beatrice on her way to execution but the later explanation is more accordant with probability and more satisfactory to the mind for such a work requires for the conditions of success both the inspiration of love and the aptitude of skill ubaldini furnished one and guido the other many travellers especially women have expressed great disappointment with the ornarina they cannot associate a figure so much the reverse of ethereal and charms so robust with the refined taste and delicate person of raffaelo but such objections are founded on an imaginative not philosophic theory of love there never was a genuine artist who in matters of feeling was not a child of nature and we have but to recognize the idiosyncrasies of poet and painter to find a key to their human affinities what a peculiar interest we feel in the objects of love whose affection cheered and whose sympathy inspired those products of pen and pencil which have become part of our mental being i have seen a crowd of halfashful and wholly intent english girls watch the carriage which contained the obese yet still fairaired countess whose youthful charms so long made byron a methodical hermit at ravenna and the respectable matron

tribune instantly gives is that of genuine womanhood there is generosity a repose a world of latent emotion an exuberance of sympathetic power in the full impassioned eye the broad symmetrical bosom the rich olive tint it is precisely the woman to harmonize by her simple presence and to soothe or exalt by her spontaneous love the mood of a man of nervous organization and ardent temper there is a tranquil selfossession in the face and figure which the sensitive and excitable artist especially finds refreshing candid nature such as alone can inspire such a man confidence a majestic simplicity peculiar to the best type of roman women more delightful to the overasked brain and sensibilities than the highest culture of an artificial kind and there is the fresh unperverted richlyeveloped harmoniouslynited heart and physique which notwithstanding the modern standard of female charms is the normal and the essential basis of honest natural affinity i could never turn in the florence gallery from the pale delicatelyounded ideal brow the almost pleading eye and the cherubic lips of raffaelo instinct with the needs as well as the immortal longings of genius to the mellow calm selfustained and healthful ornarina without fancying the support the rest the inexhaustible comfort n othello sense of that expressive word hich the sensitive artist could find in the cheerful baker

feel a musical inspiration and since i came here have been busily engaged in composition and from florence he writes here is a small picture here which i discovered for myself it is by fra bartolomeo who must have been a man of most devout tender and earnest spirit the figures are finished in the most exquisite and consummate manner you can see in the picture itself that the pious master has taken delight in painting it and in finishing the most minute details probably with a view of giving it away to gratify some friend we feel as if the painter belonged to it and still ought to be sitting before his work or had this moment left this personal magnetism about pictures is an authentic evidence of their vital relation to character and it is felt often in an incredible way by the imaginative and susceptible the same gifted and generous composer who thus wrote of titian and fra bartolomeo speaks of the impression he received from raphael portrait by himself outhful pale delicate and with such inward aspirations such longing and wistfulness in the mouth and eyes that it is as if you could see into his very soul that he cannot succeed in expressing all that he sees and feels and is thus impelled to go forward and that he must die an early death this is written on his mournful suffering yet fervid countenance vandyke portraits of charles the first impress the

assiduous pencil has transmitted the individualities of our revolutionary drama and thus the art of portraiture even in its general relations may become through illustrious subjects and rare fidelity the romance which association of ideas breeds from reality i was never more impressed with the absolute line of demarcation between the imitative and the inventive even in the lighter processes of art

announced an intelligence far beyond all mechanical art and interfused the material with the abstract the imaginative and the human as only genius can the same thing is evinced by comparing the best photographs of architecture figures or landscapes with the sketchook of a genuine artist in certain points there will be found a special intelligence and feeling which transcend the most remarkable
