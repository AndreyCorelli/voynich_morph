the first ray of light which illumines the gloom and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal pickwick would appear to be involved is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the transactions of the pickwick club which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers as a proof of the careful attention indefatigable assiduity and nice discrimination with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted may joseph smiggers esq p p p perpetual vice president ember pickwick clu presiding the following resolutions unanimously agreed to that this association has heard read with feelings of unmingled satisfaction and unqualified approval the paper communicated by samuel pickwick esq g p general chairman ember pickwick clu entitled speculations on the source of the hampstead ponds with some observations on the theory of tittlebats and that this association does hereby return its warmest thanks to the said samuel pickwick esq g p for the same that while this association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must accrue to the cause of science from the production to which they have just adverted o less than from the unwearied researches of samuel pickwick esq g p in hornsey highgate brixton and camberwell hey cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field from extending his travels and consequently enlarging his sphere of observation to the advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning that with the view just mentioned this association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal emanating from the aforesaid samuel pickwick esq g p and three other pickwickians hereinafter named for forming a new branch of united pickwickians under the title of the corresponding society of the pickwick club that the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this association that the corresponding society of the pickwick club is therefore hereby constituted and that samuel pickwick esq g p tracy tupman esq p augustus snodgrass esq p and nathaniel winkle esq p are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same and that they be requested to forward from time to time authenticated accounts of their journeys and investigations of their observations of character and manners and of the whole of their adventures together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise to the pickwick club stationed in london that this association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the corresponding society defraying his own travelling expenses and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please upon the same terms that the members of the aforesaid corresponding society be and are hereby informed that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters and the carriage of their parcels has been deliberated upon by this association that this association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it emanated and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein a casual observer adds the secretary to whose notes we are indebted for the following account casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head and circular spectacles which were intently turned towards his the secretary face during the reading of the above resolutions to those who knew that the gigantic brain of pickwick was working beneath that forehead and that the beaming eyes of pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses the sight was indeed an interesting one there sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of hampstead and agitated the scientific world with his theory of tittlebats as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar and how much more interesting did the spectacle become when starting into full life and animation as a simultaneous call for pickwick burst from his followers that illustrious man slowly mounted into the windsor chair on which he had been previously seated and addressed the club himself had founded what a study for an artist did that exciting scene present the eloquent pickwick with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters which had they clothed an ordinary man might have passed without observation but which when pickwick clothed them f we may use the expression nspired involuntary awe and respect surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries on his right sat mr tracy tupman he too susceptible tupman who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses ove time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed inch by inch had the gold watchhain beneath it disappeared from within the range of tupman s vision and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat but the soul of tupman had known no change admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion on the left of his great leader sat the poetic snodgrass and near him again the sporting winkle the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a caninekin collar and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shootingoat plaid neckerchief and closely fitted drabs mr pickwick s oration upon this occasion together with the debate thereon is entered on the transactions of the club both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies and as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men we transfer the entry to these pages mr pickwick observed says the secretar that fame was dear to the heart of every man poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend snodgrass the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend tupman and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field the air and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend winkle he mr pickwic would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings cheer ossibly by human weaknesses loud cries of no but this he would say that if ever the fire of selfmportance broke out in his bosom the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually quenched it the praise of mankind was his swing philanthropy was his insurance office vehement cheering he had felt some pride e acknowledged it freely and let his enemies make the most of it e had felt some pride when he presented his tittlebatian theory to the world it might be celebrated or it might not a cry of it is and great cheering he would take the assertion of that honourable pickwickian whose voice he had just heard t was celebrated but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him on this the proudest moment of his existence cheers he was a humble individual no no still he could not but feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour and of some danger travelling was in a troubled state and the minds of coachmen were unsettled let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them stageoaches were upsetting in all directions horses were bolting boats were overturning and boilers were bursting cheers voice no no cheers let that honourable pickwickian who cried no so loudly come forward and deny it if he could cheers who was it that cried no enthusiastic cheering was it some vain and disappointed man e would not say haberdasher loud cheer ho jealous of the praise which had been erhaps undeservedly estowed on his mr pickwick researches and smarting under the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry now took this vile and calumnious mode of mr blotton of aldgat rose to order did the honourable pickwickian allude to him cries of order chair yes no go on leave off etc mr pickwick would not put up to be put down by clamour he had alluded to the honourable gentleman great excitement mr blotton would only say then that he repelled the hon gent s false and scurrilous accusation with profound contempt great cheering the hon gent was a humbug immense confusion and loud cries of chair and order mr a snodgrass rose to order he threw himself upon the chair hear he wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue hear hear the chairman was quite sure the hon pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of mr blotton with all possible respect for the chair was quite sure he would not the chairman felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense mr blotton had no hesitation in saying that he had not e had used the word in its pickwickian sense hear hear he was bound to acknowledge that personally he entertained the highest regard and esteem for the honourable gentleman he had merely considered him a humbug in a pickwickian point of view hear hear mr pickwick felt much gratified by the fair candid and full explanation of his honourable friend he begged it to be at once understood that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a pickwickian construction cheers here the entry terminates as we have no doubt the debate did also after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point we have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the next chapter but they have been carefully collated from letters and other ms authorities so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration in a connected form chapter the first day s journey and the first evening s adventures with their consequences that punctual servant of all work the sun had just risen and begun to strike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of may one thousand eight hundred and twentyeven when mr samuel pickwick burst like another sun from his slumbers threw open his chamber window and looked out upon the world beneath goswell street was at his feet goswell street was on his right hand s far as the eye could reach goswell street extended on his left and the opposite side of goswell street was over the way such thought mr pickwick are the narrow views of those philosophers who content with examining the things that lie before them look not to the truths which are hidden beyond as well might i be content to gaze on goswell street for ever without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it and having given vent to this beautiful reflection mr pickwick proceeded to put himself into his clothes and his clothes into his portmanteau great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire the operation of shaving dressing and coffeembibing was soon performed and in another hour mr pickwick with his portmanteau in his hand his telescope in his greatcoat pocket and his noteook in his waistcoat ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down had arrived at the coachtand in st martin serand cab said mr pickwick here you are sir shouted a strange specimen of the human race in a sackcloth coat and apron of the same who with a brass label and number round his neck looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities this was the waterman here you are sir now then fust cab and the first cab having been fetched from the public house where he had been smoking his first pipe mr pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle golden cross said mr pickwick only a bob s vorth tommy cried the driver sulkily for the information of his friend the waterman as the cab drove off how old is that horse my friend inquired mr pickwick rubbing his nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare fortywo replied the driver eyeing him askant what ejaculated mr pickwick laying his hand upon his noteook the driver reiterated his former statement mr pickwick looked very hard at the man s face but his features were immovable so he noted down the fact forthwith and how long do you keep him out at a time inquired mr pickwick searching for further information two or three veeks replied the man weeks said mr pickwick in astonishment and out came the noteook again he lives at pentonwil when he s at home observed the driver coolly but we seldom takes him home on account of his weakness on account of his weakness reiterated the perplexed mr pickwick he always falls down when he s took out o the cab continued the driver but when he s in it we bears him up werry tight and takes him in werry short so as he can t werry well fall down and we ve got a pair o precious large wheels on so ven he does move they run after him and he must go on e can t help it mr pickwick entered every word of this statement in his noteook with the view of communicating it to the club as a singular instance of the tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances the entry was scarcely completed when they reached the golden cross down jumped the driver and out got mr pickwick mr tupman mr snodgrass and mr winkle who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious leader crowded to welcome him here s your fare said mr pickwick holding out the shilling to the driver what was the learned man s astonishment when that unaccountable person flung the money on the pavement and requested in figurative terms to be allowed the pleasure of fighting him mr pickwic for the amount you are mad said mr snodgrass or drunk said mr winkle or both said mr tupman come on said the cabriver sparring away like clockwork come on all four on you here s a lark shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen go to vork sam nd they crowded with great glee round the party what s the row sam inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves row replied the cabman what did he want my number for i didn t want your number said the astonished mr pickwick what did you take it for then inquired the cabman i didn t take it said mr pickwick indignantly would anybody believe continued the cabriver appealing to the crowd would anybody believe as an informer ud go about in a man s cab not only takin down his number but ev ry word he says into the bargain a light flashed upon mr pickwick t was the noteoo did he though inquired another cabman yes did he replied the first and then arter aggerawatin me to assault him gets three witnesses here to prove it but i give it him if i ve six months for it come on and the cabman dashed his hat upon the ground with a reckless disregard of his own private property and knocked mr pickwick s spectacles off and followed up the attack with a blow on mr pickwick s nose and another on mr pickwick s chest and a third in mr snodgrass s eye and a fourth by way of variety in mr tupman s waistcoat and then danced into the road and then back again to the pavement and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out of mr winkle s body and all in half a dozen seconds where s an officer said mr snodgrass put em under the pump suggested a hotieman you shall smart for this gasped mr pickwick informers shouted the crowd come on cried the cabman who had been sparring without cessation the whole time the mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene but as the intelligence of the pickwickians being informers was spread among them they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of enforcing the heated pastryendor s proposition and there is no saying what acts of personal aggression they might have committed had not the affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a newomer what s the fun said a rather tall thin young man in a green coat emerging suddenly from the coachard informers shouted the crowd again we are not roared mr pickwick in a tone which to any dispassionate listener carried conviction with it ain t you though in t you said the young man appealing to mr pickwick and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process of elbowing the countenances of its component members that learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case come along then said he of the green coat lugging mr pickwick after him by main force and talking the whole way here no take your fare and take yourself off espectable gentleman now him well none of your nonsense his way sir here s your friends a mistake i see ever mind will happen est regulated families ever say die own upon your luck ull him up ut that in his pipe ike the flavour amned rascals and with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences delivered with extraordinary volubility the stranger led the way to the traveller s waitingoom whither he was closely followed by mr pickwick and his disciples here waiter shouted the stranger ringing the bell with tremendous violence glasses round randyndater hot and strong and sweet and plenty ye damaged sir waiter raw beefteak for the gentleman s eye othing like raw beefteak for a bruise sir cold lampost very good but lampost inconvenient amned odd standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lampost h very good a ha and the stranger without stopping to take breath swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandyndater and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred while his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance mr pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance he was about the middle height but the thinness of his body and the length of his legs gave him the appearance of being much taller the green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallowails but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists it was buttoned closely up to his chin at the imminent hazard of splitting the back and an old stock without a vestige of shirt collar ornamented his neck his scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes as if to conceal the dirty white stockings which were nevertheless distinctly visible his long black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinchedp hat and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves his face was thin and haggard but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect selfossession pervaded the whole man such was the individual on whom mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles which he had fortunately recovere and to whom he proceeded when his friends had exhausted themselves to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance never mind said the stranger cutting the address very short said enough o more smart chap that cabman andled his fives well but if i been your friend in the green jemmy amn me unch his head cod i would ig s whisper ieman too o gammon this coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the rochester coachman to announce that the commodore was on the point of starting commodore said the stranger starting up my coach lace booked one outside eave you to pay for the brandyndater ant change for a five ad silver rummagem buttons on t do o go h and he shook his head most knowingly now it so happened that mr pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make rochester their first haltinglace too and having intimated to their newound acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach where they could all sit together up with you said the stranger assisting mr pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman s deportment very materially any luggage sir inquired the coachman who brown paper parcel here that s all ther luggage gone by water ackingases nailed up ig as houses eavy heavy damned heavy replied the stranger as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a

little romance down sir said mr snodgrass deeply affected certainly sir certainly ifty more if you like to hear em trange life mine ather curious history ot extraordinary but singular in this strain with an occasional glass of ale by way of parenthesis when the coach changed horses did the stranger proceed until they reached rochester bridge by which time the noteooks both of mr pickwick and mr snodgrass were completely filled with selections from his adventures magnificent ruin said mr augustus snodgrass with all the poetic fervour that distinguished him when they came in sight of the fine old castle what a study for an antiquarian were the very words which fell from mr pickwick s mouth as he applied his telescope to his eye ah fine place said the stranger glorious pile rowning walls

capital and the stranger continued to soliloquise until they reached the bull inn in the high street where the coach stopped do you remain here sir inquired mr nathaniel winkle here ot i ut you better house ice beds right s next house dear ery dear alfrown in the bill if you look at the waiter harge you more if you dine at a friend s than they would if you dined in the coffeeoom um fellows ery mr winkle turned to mr pickwick and murmured a few words a whisper passed from mr pickwick to mr snodgrass from mr snodgrass to mr tupman and nods of assent were exchanged mr pickwick addressed the stranger you rendered us a very important service this morning sir said he will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner great pleasure ot presume to dictate but broiled fowl and mushrooms apital thing what time let me see replied mr pickwick referring to his watch it is now nearly three shall we say five suit me excellently said the stranger five precisely ill then care of yourselves and lifting the pinchedp hat a few inches from his head and carelessly replacing it very much on one side the stranger with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket walked briskly up the yard and turned into the high street evidently a traveller in many countries and a close observer of men and things said mr pickwick i should like to see his poem said mr snodgrass i should like to have seen that dog said mr winkle mr tupman said nothing but he thought of donna christina the stomach pump and the fountain and his eyes filled with tears a private sittingoom having been engaged bedrooms inspected and dinner ordered the party walked out to view the city and adjoining neighbourhood we do not find from a careful perusal of mr pickwick s notes of the four towns stroud rochester chatham and brompton that his impressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those of other travellers who have gone over the same ground his general description is easily abridged the principal productions of these towns says mr pickwick appear to be soldiers sailors jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men the commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores hardake apples flatish and oysters the streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military it is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits more especially when we remember that the following them about and jesting with them affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population nothing adds mr pickwick can exceed their goodumour it was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican the barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor in return for which he had merely in playfulnes drawn his bayonet and wounded the girl in the shoulder and yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter and forget what had occurred the consumption of tobacco in these towns continues mr pickwick must be very great and the smell which pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying punctual to five o clock came the stranger and shortly afterwards the dinner he had divested himself of his brown paper parcel but had made no alteration in his attire and was if possible more loquacious than ever what s that he inquired as the waiter removed one of the covers soles sir soles h apital fish come from londontageoach proprietors get up political dinners arriage of soles ozens of baskets unning fellows glass of wine sir with pleasure said mr pickwick and the stranger took wine first with him and then with mr snodgrass and then with mr tupman and then with mr winkle and then with the whole party together almost as rapidly as he talked devil of a mess on the staircase waiter said the stranger forms going up arpenters coming down amps glasses harps what s going forward ball sir said the waiter assembly eh no sir not assembly sir ball for the benefit of a charity sir many fine women in this town do you know sir inquired mr tupman with great interest splendid apital kent sir verybody knows kent cherries hops and women glass of wine sir with great pleasure replied mr tupman the stranger filled and emptied i should very much like to go said mr tupman resuming the subject of the ball very much tickets at the bar sir interposed the waiter halfuinea each sir mr tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of mr snodgrass or the abstracted gaze of mr pickwick he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert which had just been placed on the table the waiter withdrew and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner beg your pardon sir said the stranger bottle stands ass it round ay of the sun hrough the buttonole o heeltaps and he emptied his glass which he had filled about two minutes before and poured out another with the air of a man who was used to it the wine was passed and a fresh supply ordered the visitor talked the pickwickians listened mr tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball mr pickwick s countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy and mr winkle and mr snodgrass fell fast asleep they re beginning upstairs said the stranger hear the company fiddles tuning ow the harp here they go the various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille how i should like to go said mr tupman again so should i said the stranger confounded luggage eavy smacks nothing to go in ain t it now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the pickwickian theory and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he observed so noble a principle than mr tracy tupman the number of instances recorded on the transactions of the society in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for leftff garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible i should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose said mr tracy tupman but you are rather slim and i am rather fat rownp bacchus ut the leaves ismounted from the tub and adopted kersey eh ot double distilled but double milled a ha pass the wine whether mr tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of the pickwick club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted bacchus is a fact not yet completely ascertained he passed the wine coughed twice and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity as that individual however appeared perfectly collected and quite calm under his searching glance he gradually relaxed and reverted to the subject of the ball i was about to observe sir he said that though my apparel would be too large a suit of my friend mr winkle s would perhaps fit you better the stranger took mr winkle s measure with his eye and that feature glistened with satisfaction as he said just the thing mr tupman looked round him the wine which had exerted its somniferous influence over mr snodgrass and mr winkle had stolen upon the senses of mr pickwick that gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner and its consequences he had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality like a gasamp in the street with the wind in the pipe he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy then sank so low as to be scarcely discernible after a short interval he had burst out again to enlighten for a moment then flickered with an uncertain staggering sort of light and then gone out altogether his head was sunk upon his bosom and perpetual snoring with a partial choke occasionally were the only audible indications of the great man s presence the temptation to be present at the ball and to form his first impressions of the beauty of the kentish ladies was strong upon mr tupman the temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great he was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants and the stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived there from his infancy mr winkle was asleep and mr tupman had had sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he would in the ordinary course of nature roll heavily to bed he was undecided fill your glass and pass the wine said the indefatigable visitor mr tupman did as he was requested and the additional stimulus of the last glass settled his determination winkle s bedroom is inside mine said mr tupman i couldn t make him understand what i wanted if i woke him now but i know he has a dress suit in a carpet bag and supposing you wore it to the ball and took it off when we returned i could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter capital said the stranger famous plan amned odd situation fourteen coats in the packingases and obliged to wear another man s very good notion that ery we must purchase our tickets said mr tupman not worth while splitting a guinea said the stranger toss who shall pay for both call you spin irst time oman oman ewitching woman and down came the sovereign with the dragon called by courtesy a woma uppermost mr tupman rang the bell purchased the tickets and ordered chamber candlesticks in another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely arrayed in a full suit of mr nathaniel winkle s it s a new coat said mr tupman as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass the first that s been made with our club button and he called his companions attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of mr pickwick in the centre and the letters p on either side p said the stranger queer set out ld fellow s likeness and p hat does p stand for eculiar coat eh mr tupman with rising indignation and great importance explained the mystic device rather short in the waist ain t it said the stranger screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons which were halfay up his back like a general postman s coat ueer coats those ade by contract o measuring ysterious dispensations of providence the short men get long coats the long men short ones running on in this way mr tupman s new companion adjusted his dress or rather the dress of mr winkle and accompanied by mr tupman ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom what names sir said the man at the door mr tracy tupman was stepping forward to announce his own titles when the stranger prevented him no names at all and then he whispered mr tupman names won t do not known ery good names in their way but not great ones apital names for a small party but won t make an impression in public assemblies ncog the thing entlemen from london istinguished foreigners nything the door was thrown open and mr tracy tupman and the stranger entered the ballroom it was a long room with crimsonovered benches and wax candles in glass chandeliers the musicians were securely confined in an elevated den and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of dancers two cardables were made up in the adjoining cardoom and two pair of old ladies and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen were executing whist therein the finale concluded the dancers promenaded the room and mr tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company charming women said mr tupman wait a minute said the stranger fun presently obs not come yet queer place ockyard people of upper rank don t know dockyard people of lower rank ockyard people of lower rank don t know small gentry mall gentry don t know tradespeople ommissioner don t know anybody who s that little boy with the

lady in blue satin and two young ladies on a similar scale in fashionablyade dresses of the same hue commissioner ead of the yard reat man emarkably great man whispered the stranger in mr tupman s ear as the charitable committee ushered sir thomas clubber and family to the top of the room the honourable wilmot snipe and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the misses clubber and sir thomas clubber stood bolt upright and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company mr smithie mrs smithie and the misses smithie was the next announcement what s mr smithie inquired mr tracy tupman something in the yard replied the stranger mr smithie bowed deferentially to sir thomas clubber and sir thomas clubber acknowledged the salute with conscious

clubber the greeting between mrs colonel bulder and lady clubber was of the most affectionate description colonel bulder and sir thomas clubber exchanged snuffoxes and looked very much like a pair of alexander selkirks monarchs of all they surveyed while the aristocracy of the place he bulders and clubbers and snipes ere thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it the less aristocratic officers of the th devoted themselves to the families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard the

slammer surgeon to the th the doctor took snuff with everybody chatted with everybody laughed danced made jokes played whist did everything and was everywhere to these pursuits multifarious as they were the little doctor added a more important one than any e was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income upon the doctor and the widow the eyes of both mr tupman and his companion had been fixed for some time when the stranger broke silence lots of money ld girl ompous doctor ot a bad idea fun were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips mr tupman looked inquisitively in his face i dance with the widow said the stranger who is she inquired mr tupman don t know ever saw her in all my life ut out the doctor ere goes and the stranger forthwith crossed the room and leaning against a manteliece commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady mr tupman looked on in mute astonishment the stranger progressed rapidly the little doctor danced with another lady the widow dropped her fan the stranger picked it up and presented it smile bow curtsey a few words of conversation the stranger walked boldly up to and returned with the master of the ceremonies a little introductory pantomime and the stranger and mrs budger took their places in a quadrille the surprise of mr tupman at this summary proceeding great as it was was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor the stranger was young and the widow was flattered the doctor s attentions were unheeded by the widow and the doctor s indignation was wholly lost on his imperturbable rival doctor slammer was paralysed he doctor slammer of the th to be extinguished in a moment by a man whom nobody had ever seen before and whom nobody knew even now doctor slammer octor slammer of the th rejected impossible it could not be yes it was there they were what introducing his friend could he believe his eyes he looked again and was under the painful necessity of admitting the veracity of his optics mrs budger was dancing with mr tracy tupman there was no mistaking the fact there was the widow before him bouncing bodily here and there with unwonted vigour and mr tracy tupman hopping about with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity dancing as a good many people as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this and all the handings of negus and watching for glasses and darting for biscuits and coquetting that ensued but a few seconds after the stranger had disappeared to lead mrs budger to her carriage he darted swiftly from the room with every particle of his hithertoottledp indignation effervescing from all parts of his countenance in a perspiration of passion the stranger was returning and mr tupman was beside him he spoke in a low tone and laughed the little doctor thirsted for his life he was exulting he had triumphed sir said the doctor in an awful voice producing a card and retiring into an angle of the passage my name is slammer doctor slammer sir th regiment hatham barracks y card sir my card he would have added more but his indignation choked him ah replied the stranger coolly slammer uch obliged olite attention ot ill now slammer ut when i am nock you up you ou re a shuffler sir gasped the furious doctor a poltroon coward liar ill nothing induce you to give me your card sir oh i see said the stranger half aside negus too strong here liberal landlord ery foolish ery emonade much better ot rooms elderly gentlemen uffer for it in the morning ruel ruel and he moved on a step or two you are stopping in this house sir said the indignant little man you are intoxicated now sir you shall hear from me in the morning sir i shall find you out sir i shall find you out rather you found me out than found me at home replied the unmoved stranger doctor slammer looked unutterable ferocity as he fixed his hat on his head with an indignant knock and the stranger and mr tupman ascended to the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the unconscious winkle that gentleman was fast asleep the restoration was soon made the stranger was extremely jocose and mr tracy tupman being quite bewildered with wine negus lights and ladies thought the whole affair was an exquisite joke his new friend departed and after experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his nightcap originally intended for the reception of his head and finally overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on mr tracy tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions and shortly afterwards sank into repose seven o clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning when mr pickwick s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness in which slumber had plunged it by a loud knocking at his chamber door who s there said mr pickwick starting up in bed boots sir what do you want please sir can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a bright blue dressoat with a gilt button with p on it it s been given out to brush thought mr pickwick and the man has forgotten whom it belongs to mr winkle he called out next room but two on the right hand thank sir said the boots and away he went what s the matter cried mr tupman as a loud knocking at his door roused him from his oblivious repose can i speak to mr winkle sir replied boots from the outside winkle inkle shouted mr tupman calling into the inner room hollo replied a faint voice from within the bedlothes you re wanted ome one at the door and having exerted himself to articulate thus much mr tracy tupman turned round and fell fast asleep again wanted said mr winkle hastily jumping out of bed and putting on a few articles of clothing wanted at this distance from town ho on earth can want me gentleman in the coffeeoom sir replied the boots as mr winkle opened the door and confronted him gentleman says he not detain you a moment sir but he can take no denial very odd said mr winkle i be down directly he hurriedly wrapped himself in a travellinghawl and dressingown and proceeded downstairs an old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning the coffeeoom and an officer in undress uniform was looking out of the window he turned round as mr winkle entered and made a stiff inclination of the head having ordered the attendants to retire and closed the door very carefully he said mr winkle i presume my name is winkle sir you will not be surprised sir when i inform you that i have called here this morning on behalf of my friend doctor slammer of the th doctor slammer said mr winkle doctor slammer he begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure and he adde which no one gentleman would pursue towards another mr winkle s astonishment was too real and too evident to escape the observation of doctor slammer s friend he therefore proceeded my friend doctor slammer requested me to add that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of he commissioned me to say that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your behaviour he will consent to accept a written apology to be penned by you from my dictation a written apology repeated mr winkle in the most emphatic tone of amazement possible of course you know the alternative replied the visitor coolly were you intrusted with this message to me by name inquired mr winkle whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary conversation i was not present myself replied the visitor and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to doctor slammer i was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat bright blue dressoat with a gilt button displaying a bust and the letters p mr winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described doctor slammer s friend proceeded from the inquiries i made at the bar just now i was convinced that the owner of the coat in question arrived here with three gentlemen yesterday afternoon i immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as appearing the head of the party and he at once referred me to you if the principal tower of rochester castle had suddenly walked from its foundation and stationed itself opposite the coffeeoom window mr winkle s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound astonishment with which he had heard this address his first impression was that his coat had been stolen will you allow me to detain you one moment said he certainly replied the unwelcome visitor mr winkle ran hastily upstairs and with a trembling hand opened the bag there was the coat in its usual place but exhibiting on a close inspection evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night it must be so said mr winkle letting the coat fall from his hands i took too much wine after dinner and have a very vague recollection of walking about the streets and smoking a cigar afterwards the fact is i was very drunk must have changed my coat one somewhere nd insulted somebody have no doubt of it and this message is the terrible consequence saying which mr winkle retraced his steps in the direction of the coffeeoom with the gloomy and dreadful resolve of accepting the challenge of the warlike doctor slammer and abiding by the worst consequences that might ensue to this determination mr winkle was urged by a variety of considerations the first of which was his reputation with the club he had always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of amusement and dexterity whether offensive defensive or inoffensive and if on this very first occasion of being put to the test he shrunk back from the trial beneath his leader s eye his name and standing were lost for ever besides he remembered to have heard it frequently surmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood arrangement between the seconds the pistols were seldom loaded with ball and furthermore he reflected that if he applied to mr snodgrass to act as his second and depicted the danger in glowing terms that gentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to mr pickwick who would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local authorities and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower such were his thoughts when he returned to the coffeeoom and intimated his intention of accepting the doctor s challenge will you refer me to a friend to arrange the time and place of meeting said the officer quite unnecessary replied mr winkle name them to me and i can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards shall we say unset this evening inquired the officer in a careless tone very good replied mr winkle thinking in his heart it was very bad you know fort pitt yes i saw it yesterday if you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the trench take the footath to the left when you arrive at an angle of the fortification and keep straight on till you see me i will precede you to a secluded place where the affair can be conducted without fear of interruption fear of interruption thought mr winkle nothing more to arrange i think said the officer i am not aware of anything more replied mr winkle goodorning goodorning and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away that morning s breakfast passed heavily off mr tupman was not in a condition to rise after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night mr snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits and even mr pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda water mr winkle eagerly watched his opportunity it was not long wanting mr snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle and as mr winkle was the only other member of the party disposed to walk they went out together snodgrass said mr winkle when they had turned out of the public street snodgrass my dear fellow can i rely upon your secrecy as he said this he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not you can replied mr snodgrass hear me swear no no interrupted winkle terrified at the idea of his companion s unconsciously pledging himself not to give information don t swear don t swear it s quite unnecessary mr snodgrass dropped the hand which he had in the spirit of poesy raised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal and assumed an attitude of attention i want your assistance my dear fellow in an affair of honour said mr winkle you shall have it replied mr snodgrass clasping his friend s hand with a doctor octor slammer of the th said mr winkle wishing to make the matter appear as solemn as possible an affair with an officer seconded by another officer at sunset this evening in a lonely field beyond fort pitt i will attend you said mr snodgrass he was astonished but by no means dismayed it is extraordinary how cool any party but the principal can be in such cases mr winkle had forgotten this he had judged of his friend s feelings by his own the consequences may be dreadful said mr winkle i hope not said mr snodgrass the doctor i believe is a very good shot said mr winkle most of these military men are observed mr snodgrass calmly but so are you ain t you mr winkle replied in the affirmative and perceiving that he had not alarmed his companion sufficiently changed his ground snodgrass he said in a voice tremulous with emotion if i fall you will find in a packet which i shall place in your hands a note for my for my father this attack was a failure also mr snodgrass was affected but he undertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a twopenny postman if i fall said mr winkle or if the doctor falls you my dear friend will be tried as an accessory before the fact shall i involve my friend in transportation ossibly for life mr snodgrass winced a little at this but his heroism was invincible in the cause of friendship he fervently exclaimed i would brave all dangers how mr winkle cursed his companion s devoted friendship internally as they walked silently along side by side for some minutes each immersed in his own meditations the morning was wearing away he grew desperate snodgrass he said stopping suddenly do not let me be balked in this matter o not give information to the local authorities o not obtain the assistance of several peace officers to take either me or doctor slammer of the th regiment at present quartered in chatham barracks into custody and thus prevent this duel say do not mr snodgrass seized his friend s hand warmly as he enthusiastically replied not for worlds a thrill passed over mr winkle s frame as the conviction that he had nothing to hope from his friend s fears and that he was destined to become an animated target rushed forcibly upon him the state of the case having been formally explained to mr snodgrass and a case of satisfactory pistols with the satisfactory accompaniments of powder ball and caps having been hired from a manufacturer in rochester the two friends returned to their inn mr winkle to ruminate on the approaching struggle and mr snodgrass to arrange the weapons of war and put them into proper order for immediate use it was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their awkward errand mr winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape observation and mr snodgrass bore under his the instruments of destruction have you got everything said mr winkle in an agitated tone everything replied mr snodgrass plenty of ammunition in case the shots don t take effect there s a quarter of a pound of powder in the case and i have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings these were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel most grateful the presumption is that the gratitude of mr winkle was too powerful for utterance as he said nothing but continued to walk on ather slowly we are in excellent time said mr snodgrass as they climbed the fence of the first field the sun is just going down mr winkle looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his going down himself before long there s the officer exclaimed mr winkle after a few minutes walking where said mr snodgrass there he gentleman in the blue cloak mr snodgrass looked in the direction indicated by the forefinger of his friend and observed a figure muffled up as he had described the officer evinced his consciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand and the two friends followed him at a little distance as he walked away the evening grew more dull every moment and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields like a distant giant whistling for his houseog the sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of mr winkle he started as they passed the angle of the trench t looked like a colossal grave the officer turned suddenly from the path and after climbing a paling and scaling a hedge entered a secluded field two gentlemen were waiting in it one was a little fat man with black hair and the other portly personage in a braided surtout as sitting with perfect equanimity on a camptool the other party and a surgeon i suppose said mr snodgrass take a drop of brandy mr winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend proffered and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid my friend sir mr snodgrass said mr winkle as the officer approached doctor slammer s friend bowed and produced a case similar to that which mr snodgrass carried we have nothing further to say sir i think he coldly remarked as he opened the case an apology has been resolutely declined nothing sir said mr snodgrass who began to feel rather uncomfortable himself will you step forward said the officer certainly replied mr snodgrass the ground was measured and preliminaries arranged you will find these better than your own said the opposite second producing his pistols you saw me load them do you object to use them certainly not replied mr snodgrass the offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined we may place our men then i think observed the officer with as much indifference as if the principals were chessen and the seconds players i think we may replied mr snodgrass who would have assented to any proposition because he knew nothing about the matter the officer crossed to doctor slammer and mr snodgrass went up to mr winkle it s all ready said he offering the pistol give me your cloak you have got the packet my dear fellow said poor winkle all right said mr snodgrass be steady and wing him it occurred to mr winkle that this advice was very like that which bystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight namely go in and win n admirable thing to recommend if you only know how to do it he took off his cloak however in silence t always took a long time to undo that cloak nd accepted the pistol the seconds retired the gentleman on the camptool did the same and the belligerents approached each other mr winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity it is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellowreature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of doctor slammer that gentleman started stared retreated rubbed his eyes stared again and finally shouted stop stop what s all this said doctor slammer as his friend and mr snodgrass came running up that s not the man not the man said doctor slammer s second not the man said mr snodgrass not the man said the gentleman with the camptool in his hand certainly not replied the little doctor that s not the person who insulted me last night very extraordinary exclaimed the officer very said the gentleman with the camptool the only question is whether the gentleman being on the ground must not be considered as a matter of form to be the individual who insulted our friend doctor slammer yesterday evening whether he is really that individual or not and having delivered this suggestion with a very sage and mysterious air the man with the camptool took a large pinch of snuff and looked profoundly round with the air of an authority in such matters now mr winkle had opened his eyes and his ears too when he heard his adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities and perceiving by what he had afterwards said that there was beyond all question some mistake in the matter he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out he therefore stepped boldly forward and said i am not the person i know it then that said the man with the camptool is an affront to doctor slammer and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately pray be quiet payne said the doctor s second why did you not communicate this fact to me this morning sir to be sure o be sure said the man with the camptool indignantly i entreat you to be quiet payne said the other may i repeat my question sir because sir replied mr winkle who had had time to deliberate upon his answer because sir you described an intoxicated and ungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which i have the honour not only to wear but to have invented he proposed uniform sir of the pickwick club in london the honour of that uniform i feel bound to maintain and i therefore without inquiry accepted the challenge which you offered me my dear sir said the goodumoured little doctor advancing with extended hand i honour your gallantry permit me to say sir that i highly admire your conduct and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting to no purpose i beg you won t mention it sir said mr winkle i shall feel proud of your acquaintance sir said the little doctor it will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you sir replied mr winkle thereupon the doctor and mr winkle shook hands and then mr winkle and lieutenant tappleton the doctor s secon and then mr winkle and the man with the camptool and finally mr winkle and mr snodgrass he lastamed gentleman in an excess of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend i think we may adjourn said lieutenant tappleton certainly added the doctor unless interposed the man with the camptool unless mr winkle feels himself aggrieved by the challenge in which case i submit he has a right to satisfaction mr winkle with great selfenial expressed himself quite satisfied already or possibly said the man with the camptool the gentleman s second may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an early period of this meeting if so i shall be happy to give him satisfaction immediately mr snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings the two seconds adjusted the cases and the whole party left the ground in a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it do you remain long here inquired doctor slammer of mr winkle as they walked on most amicably together i think we shall leave here the day after toorrow was the reply i trust i shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms and of spending a pleasant evening with you after this awkward mistake said the little doctor are you disengaged this evening we have some friends here replied mr winkle and i should not like to leave them toight perhaps you and your friend will join us at the bull with great pleasure said the little doctor will ten o clock be too late to look in for half an hour oh dear no said mr winkle i shall be most happy to introduce you to my friends mr pickwick and mr tupman it will give me great pleasure i am sure replied doctor slammer little suspecting who mr tupman was you will be sure to come said mr snodgrass oh certainly by this time they had reached the road cordial farewells were exchanged and the party separated doctor slammer and his friends repaired to the barracks and mr winkle accompanied by mr snodgrass returned to their inn chapter a new acquaintance he stroller s tale disagreeable interruption and an unpleasant encounter mr pickwick had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two friends which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by no means tended to diminish it was therefore with more than ordinary pleasure that he rose to greet them when they again entered and with more than ordinary interest that he inquired what had occurred to detain them from his society in reply to his questions on this point mr snodgrass was about to offer an historical account of the circumstances just now detailed when he was suddenly checked by observing that there were present not only mr tupman and their stageoach companion of the preceding day but another stranger of equally singular appearance it was a carewornooking man whose sallow face and deeplyunken eyes were rendered still more striking than nature had made them by the straight black hair which hung in matted disorder halfay down his face his eyes were almost unnaturally bright and piercing his cheekones were high and prominent and his jaws were so long and lank that an observer would have supposed that he was drawing the flesh of his face in for a moment by some contraction of the muscles if his halfpened mouth and immovable expression had not announced that it was his ordinary appearance round his neck he wore a green shawl with the large ends straggling over his chest and making their appearance occasionally beneath the worn buttonoles of his old waistcoat his upper garment was a long black surtout and below it he wore wide drab trousers and large boots running rapidly to seed it was on this uncouthooking person that mr winkle s eye rested and it was towards him that mr pickwick extended his hand when he said a friend of our friend s here we discovered this morning that our friend was connected with the theatre in this place though he is not desirous to have it generally known and this gentleman is a member of the same profession he was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected with it when you entered lots of anecdote said the greenoated stranger of the day before advancing to mr winkle and speaking in a low and confidential tone rum fellow oes the heavy business o actor trange man sorts of miseries ismal jemmy we call him on the circuit mr winkle and mr snodgrass politely welcomed the gentleman elegantly designated as dismal jemmy and calling for brandyndater in imitation of the remainder of the company seated themselves at the table now sir said mr pickwick will you oblige us by proceeding with what you were going to relate the dismal individual took a dirty roll of paper from his pocket and turning to mr snodgrass who had just taken out his noteook said in a hollow voice perfectly in keeping with his outward man are you the poet i do a little in that way replied mr snodgrass rather taken aback by the abruptness of the question ah poetry makes life what light and music do the stage trip the one of the false embellishments and the other of its illusions and what is there real in either to live or care for very true sir replied mr snodgrass to be before the footlights continued the dismal man is like sitting at a grand court show and admiring the silken dresses of the gaudy throng to be behind them is to be the people who make that finery uncared for and unknown and left to sink or swim to starve or live as fortune wills it certainly said mr snodgrass for the sunken eye of the dismal man rested on him and he felt it necessary to say something go on jemmy said the spanish traveller like blackyed susan in the downs o croaking peak out lively will you make another glass before you begin sir said mr pickwick the dismal man took the hint and having mixed a glass of brandynd water and slowly swallowed half of it opened the roll of paper and proceeded partly to read and partly to relate the following incident which we find recorded on the transactions of the club as the stroller s tale the stroller s tale there is nothing of the marvellous in what i am going to relate said the dismal man there is nothing even uncommon in it want and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature i have thrown these few notes together because the subject of them was well known to me for many years i traced his progress downwards step by step until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again the man of whom i speak was a low pantomime actor and like many people of his class an habitual drunkard in his better days before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease he had been in the receipt of a good salary which if he had been careful and prudent he might have continued to receive for some years ot many because these men either die early or by unnaturally taxing their bodily energies lose prematurely those physical powers on which alone they can depend for subsistence his besetting sin gained so fast upon him however that it was found impossible to employ him in the situations in which he really was useful to the theatre the public house had a fascination for him which he could not resist neglected disease and hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death itself if he persevered in the same course yet he did persevere and the result may be guessed he could obtain no engagement and he wanted bread everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby povertytricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment ot regularly engaged actors but ballet people procession men tumblers and so forth who are taken on during the run of a pantomime or an easter piece and are then discharged until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services to this mode of life the man was compelled to resort and taking the chair every night at some low theatrical house at once put him in possession of a few more shillings weekly and enabled him to gratify his old propensity even this resource shortly failed him his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way about this time and when he had been existing for upwards of a year no one knew how i had a short engagement at one of the theatres on the surrey side of the water and here i saw this man whom i had lost sight of for some time for i had been travelling in the provinces and he had been skulking in the lanes and alleys of london i was dressed to leave the house and was crossing the stage on my way out when he tapped me on the shoulder never shall i forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when i turned round he was dressed for the pantomimes in all the absurdity of a clown s costume the spectral figures in the dance of death the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed on canvas never presented an appearance half so ghastly his bloated body and shrunken legs heir deformity enhanced a hundredfold by the fantastic dress he glassy eyes contrasting fearfully with the thick white paint with which the face was besmeared the grotesquely ornamented head trembling with paralysis and the long skinny hands rubbed with white chalk gave him a hideous and unnatural appearance of which no description could convey an adequate idea and which to this day i shudder to think of his voice was hollow and tremulous as he took me aside and in broken words recounted a long catalogue of sickness and privations terminating as usual with an urgent request for the loan of a trifling sum of money i put a few shillings in his hand and as i turned away i heard the roar of laughter which followed his first tumble on the stage a few nights afterwards a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand on which were scrawled a few words in pencil intimating that the man was dangerously ill and begging me after the performance to see him at his lodgings in some street forget the name of it now t no great distance from the theatre i promised to comply as soon as i could get away and after the curtain fell sallied forth on my melancholy errand it was late for i had been playing in the last piece and as it was a benefit night the performances had been protracted to an unusual length it was a dark cold night with a chill damp wind which blew the rain heavily against the windows and houseronts pools of water had collected in the narrow and littlerequented streets and as many of the thinlycattered oilamps had been blown out by the violence of the wind the walk was not only a comfortless but most uncertain one i had fortunately taken the right course however and succeeded after a little difficulty in finding the house to which i had been directed coalhed with one storey above it in the back room of which lay the object of my search a wretchedooking woman the man s wife met me on the stairs and telling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze led me softly in and placed a chair for me at the bedside the sick man was lying with his face turned towards the wall and as he took no heed of my presence i had leisure to observe the place in which i found myself he was lying on an old bedstead which turned up during the day the tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed s head to exclude the wind which however made its way into the comfortless room through the numerous chinks in the door and blew it to and fro every instant there was a low cinder fire in a rusty unfixed grate and an old threeornered stained table with some medicine bottles a broken glass and a few other domestic articles was drawn out before it a little child was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made for it on the floor and the woman sat on a chair by its side there were a couple of shelves with a few plates and cups and saucers and a pair of stage shoes and a couple of foils hung beneath them with the exception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the room these were the only things in the apartment i had had time to note these little particulars and to mark the heavy breathing and feverish startings of the sick man before he was aware of my presence in the restless attempts to procure some easy restinglace for his head he tossed his hand out of the bed and it fell on mine he started up and stared eagerly in my face mr hutley john said his wife mr hutley that you sent for to night you know ah said the invalid passing his hand across his forehead hutley hutley et me see he seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said don t leave me on t leave me old fellow she murder me i know she will has he been long so said i addressing his weeping wife since yesterday night she replied john john don t you know me don t let her come near me said the man with a shudder as she stooped over him drive her away i can t bear her near me he stared wildly at her with a look of deadly apprehension and then whispered in my ear i beat her jem i beat her yesterday and many times before i have starved her and the boy too and now i am weak and helpless jem she murder me for it i know she will if you seen her cry as i have you know it too keep her off he relaxed his grasp and sank back exhausted on the pillow i knew but too well what all this meant if i could have entertained any doubt of it for an instant one glance at the woman s pale face and wasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the case you had better stand aside said i to the poor creature you can do him no good perhaps he will be calmer if he does not see you she retired out of the man s sight he opened his eyes after a few seconds and looked anxiously round is she gone he eagerly inquired yes es said i she shall not hurt you i tell you what jem said the man in a low voice she does hurt me there s something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my heart that it drives me mad all last night her large staring eyes and pale face were close to mine wherever i turned they turned and whenever i started up from my sleep she was at the bedside looking at me he drew me closer to him as he said in a deep alarmed whisper jem she must be an evil spirit devil hush i know she is if she had been a woman she would have died long ago no woman could have borne what she has i sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man i could say nothing in reply for who could offer hope or consolation to the abject being before me i sat there for upwards of two hours during which time he tossed about murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience restlessly throwing his arms here and there and turning constantly from side to side at length he fell into that state of partial unconsciousness in which the mind wanders uneasily from scene to scene and from place to place without the control of reason but still without being able to divest itself of an indescribable sense of present suffering finding from his incoherent wanderings that this was the case and knowing that in all probability the fever would not grow immediately worse i left him promising his miserable wife that i would repeat my visit next evening and if necessary sit up with the patient during the night i kept my promise the last fourndwenty hours had produced a frightful alteration the eyes though deeply sunk and heavy shone with a lustre frightful to behold the lips were parched and cracked in many places the hard dry skin glowed with a burning heat and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man s face indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease the fever was at its height i took the seat i had occupied the night before and there i sat for hours listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most callous among human beings he awful ravings of a dying man from what i had heard of the medical attendant s opinion i knew there was no hope for him i was sitting by his deathed i saw the wasted limbs which a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous gallery writhing under the tortures of a burning fever heard the clown s shrill laugh blending with the low murmurings of the dying man it is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary occupations and pursuits of health when the body lies before you weak and helpless but when those occupations are of a character the most strongly opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas the impression produced is infinitely more powerful the theatre and the publicouse were the chief themes of the wretched man s wanderings it was evening he fancied he had a part to play that night it was late and he must leave home instantly why did they hold him and prevent his going e should lose the money e must go no they would not let him he hid his face in his burning hands and feebly bemoaned his own weakness and the cruelty of his persecutors a short pause and he shouted out a few doggerel rhymes he last he had ever learned he rose in bed drew up his withered limbs and rolled about in uncouth positions he was acting e was at the theatre a minute s silence and he murmured the burden of some roaring song he had reached the old house at last ow hot the room was he had been ill very ill but he was well now and happy fill up his glass who was that that dashed it from his lips it was the same persecutor that had followed him before he fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud a short period of oblivion and he was wandering through a tedious maze of lowrched rooms o low sometimes that he must creep upon his hands and knees to make his way along it was close and dark and every way he turned some obstacle impeded his progress there were insects too hideous crawling things with eyes that stared upon him and filled the very air around glistening horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place the walls and ceiling were alive with reptiles he vault expanded to an enormous size rightful figures flitted to and fro nd the faces of men he knew rendered hideous by gibing and mouthing peered out from among them they were searing him with heated irons and binding his head with cords till the blood started and he struggled madly for life at the close of one of these paroxysms when i had with great difficulty held him down in his bed he sank into what appeared to be a slumber overpowered with watching and exertion i had closed my eyes for a few minutes when i felt a violent clutch on my shoulder i awoke instantly he had raised himself up so as to seat himself in bed dreadful change had come over his face but consciousness had returned for he evidently knew me the child who had been long since disturbed by his ravings rose from its little bed and ran towards its father screaming with fright he mother hastily caught it in her arms lest he should injure it in the violence of his insanity but terrified by the alteration of his features stood transfixed by the bedside he grasped my shoulder convulsively and striking his breast with the other hand made a desperate attempt to articulate it was unavailing he extended his arm towards them and made another violent effort there was a rattling noise in the throat glare of the eye short stifled groan nd he fell back ead it would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record mr pickwick s opinion of the foregoing anecdote we have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers but for a most unfortunate occurrence mr pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which during the last few sentences of the tale he had retained in his hand and had just made up his mind to speak ndeed we have the authority of mr snodgrass s noteook for stating that he had actually opened his mouth hen the waiter entered the room and said some gentlemen sir it has been conjectured that mr pickwick was on the point of delivering some remarks which would have enlightened the world if not the thames when he was thus interrupted for he gazed sternly on the waiter s countenance and then looked round on the company generally as if seeking for information relative to the newomers oh said mr winkle rising some friends of mine how them in very pleasant fellows added mr winkle after the waiter had retired officers of the th whose acquaintance i made rather oddly this morning you will like them very much mr pickwick s equanimity was at once restored the waiter returned and ushered three gentlemen into the room lieutenant tappleton said mr winkle lieutenant tappleton mr pickwick octor payne mr pickwick r snodgrass you have seen before my friend mr tupman doctor payne octor slammer mr pickwick r tupman doctor slam here mr winkle suddenly paused for strong emotion was visible on the countenance both of mr tupman and the doctor i have met this gentleman before said the doctor with marked emphasis indeed said mr winkle and nd that person too if i am not mistaken said the doctor bestowing a scrutinising glance on the greenoated stranger i think i gave that person a very pressing invitation last night which he thought proper to decline saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the stranger and whispered his friend lieutenant tappleton you don t say so said that gentleman at the conclusion of the whisper i do indeed replied doctor slammer you are bound to kick him on the spot murmured the owner of the camp stool with great importance do be quiet payne interposed the lieutenant will you allow me to ask you sir he said addressing mr pickwick who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite bylay will you allow me to ask you sir whether that person belongs to your party no sir replied mr pickwick he is a guest of ours he is a member of your club or i am mistaken said the lieutenant inquiringly certainly not responded mr pickwick and never wears your clubutton said the lieutenant no ever replied the astonished mr pickwick lieutenant tappleton turned round to his friend doctor slammer with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection the little doctor looked wrathful but confounded and mr payne gazed with a ferocious aspect on the beaming countenance of the unconscious pickwick sir said the doctor suddenly addressing mr tupman in a tone which made that gentleman start as perceptibly as if a pin had been cunningly inserted in the calf of his leg you were at the ball here last night mr tupman gasped a faint affirmative looking very hard at mr pickwick all the while that person was your companion said the doctor pointing to the still unmoved stranger mr tupman admitted the fact now sir said the doctor to the stranger i ask you once again in the presence of these gentlemen whether you choose to give me your card and to receive the treatment of a gentleman or whether you impose upon me the necessity of personally chastising you on the spot stay sir said mr pickwick i really cannot allow this matter to go any further without some explanation tupman recount the circumstances mr tupman thus solemnly adjured stated the case in a few words touched slightly on the borrowing of the coat expatiated largely on its having been done after dinner wound up with a little penitence on his own account and left the stranger to clear himself as best he could he was apparently about to proceed to do so when lieutenant tappleton who had been eyeing him with great curiosity said with considerable scorn haven t i seen you at the theatre sir certainly replied the unabashed stranger he is a strolling actor said the lieutenant contemptuously turning to doctor slammer he acts in the piece that the officers of the nd get up at the rochester theatre toorrow night you cannot proceed in this affair slammer mpossible quite said the dignified payne sorry to have placed you in this disagreeable situation said lieutenant tappleton addressing mr pickwick allow me to suggest that the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more select in the choice of your companions goodvening sir and the lieutenant bounced out of the room and allow me to say sir said the irascible doctor payne that if i had been tappleton or if i had been slammer i would have pulled your nose sir and the nose of every man in this company i would sir every man payne is my name sir octor payne of the rd good evening sir having concluded this speech and uttered the last three words in a loud key he stalked majestically after his friend closely followed by doctor slammer who said nothing but contented himself by withering the company with a look rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of mr pickwick almost to the bursting of his waistcoat during the delivery of the above defiance he stood transfixed to the spot gazing on vacancy the closing of the door recalled him to himself he rushed forward with fury in his looks and fire in his eye his hand was upon the lock of the door in another instant it would have been on the throat of doctor payne of the rd had not mr snodgrass seized his revered leader by the coat tail and dragged him backwards restrain him cried mr snodgrass winkle tupman e must not peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this let me go said mr pickwick hold him tight shouted mr snodgrass and by the united efforts of the whole company mr pickwick was forced into an armhair leave him alone said the greenoated stranger brandyndater jolly old gentleman ots of pluck wallow this h apital stuff having previously tested the virtues of a bumper which had been mixed by the dismal man the stranger applied the glass to mr pickwick s mouth and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared there was a short pause the brandyndater had done its work the amiable countenance of mr pickwick was fast recovering its customary expression they are not worth your notice said the dismal man you are right sir replied mr pickwick they are not i am ashamed to have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling draw your chair up to the table sir the dismal man readily complied a circle was again formed round the table and harmony once more prevailed some lingering irritability appeared to find a restinglace in mr winkle s bosom occasioned possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat hough it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited even a passing feeling of anger in a pickwickian s breast with this exception their goodumour was completely restored and the evening concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun chapter a field day and bivouac ore new friends n invitation to the country many authors entertain not only a foolish but a really dishonest objection to acknowledge the sources whence they derive much valuable information we have no such feeling we are merely endeavouring to discharge in an upright manner the responsible duties of our editorial functions and whatever ambition we might have felt under other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these adventures a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their judicious arrangement and impartial narration the pickwick papers are our new river head and we may be compared to the new river company the labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts we merely lay them on and communicate them in a clear and gentle stream through the medium of these pages to a world thirsting for pickwickian knowledge acting in this spirit and resolutely proceeding on our determination to avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted we frankly say that to the noteook of mr snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars recorded in this and the succeeding chapter articulars which now that we have disburdened our consciences we shall proceed to detail without further comment the whole population of rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement a grand review was to take place upon the lines the manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commandernhief temporary fortifications had been erected the citadel was to be attacked and taken and a mine was to be sprung mr pickwick was as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract we gave from his description of chatham an enthusiastic admirer of the army nothing could have been more delightful to him othing could have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his companions s this sight accordingly they were soon afoot and walking in the direction of the scene of action towards which crowds of people were already pouring from a variety of quarters the appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance there were sentries posted to keep the ground for the troops and servants on the batteries keeping places for the ladies and sergeants running to and fro with vellumovered books under their arms and colonel bulder in full military uniform on horseback galloping first to one place and then to another and backing his horse among the people and prancing and curvetting and shouting in a most alarming manner and making himself very hoarse in the voice and very red in the face without any assignable cause or reason whatever officers were running backwards and forwards first communicating with colonel bulder and then ordering the sergeants and then running away altogether and even the very privates themselves looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of mysterious solemnity which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of the occasion mr pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front of the crowd and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings the throng was increasing every moment and the efforts they were compelled to make to retain the position they had gained sufficiently occupied their attention during the two hours that ensued at one time there was a sudden pressure from behind and then mr pickwick was jerked forward for several yards with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent with the general gravity of his demeanour at another moment there was a request to keep back from the front and then the buttnd of a musket was either dropped upon mr pickwick s toe to remind him of the demand or thrust into his chest to insure its being complied with then some facetious gentlemen on the left after pressing sideways in a body and squeezing mr snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture would request to know vere he vos a shovin to and when mr winkle had done expressing his excessive indignation at witnessing this unprovoked assault some person behind would knock his hat over his eyes and beg the favour of his putting his head in his pocket these and other practical witticisms coupled with the unaccountable absence of mr tupman who had suddenly disappeared and was nowhere to be foun rendered their situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable at length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for all eyes were turned in the direction of the sallyort a few moments of eager expectation and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air arms glistened brightly in the sun column after column poured on to the plain the troops halted and formed the word of command rang through the line there was a general clash of muskets as arms were presented and the commandernhief attended by colonel bulder and numerous officers cantered to the front the military bands struck up altogether the horses stood upon two legs each cantered backwards and whisked their tails about in all directions the dogs barked the mob screamed the troops recovered and nothing was to be seen on either side as far as the eye could reach but a long perspective of red coats and white trousers fixed and motionless mr pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about and disentangling himself miraculously from between the legs of horses that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him until it assumed the appearance we have just described when he was at last enabled to stand firmly on his legs his gratification and delight were unbounded can anything be finer or more delightful he inquired of mr winkle nothing replied that gentleman who had had a short man standing on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding it is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight said mr snodgrass in whose bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth to see the gallant defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful citizens their faces beaming ot with warlike ferocity but with civilised gentleness their eyes flashing ot with the rude fire of rapine or revenge but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence mr pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium but he could not exactly recho its terms for the soft light of intelligence burned rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors inasmuch as the command eyes front had been given and all the spectator saw before him was several thousand pair of optics staring straight forward wholly divested of any expression whatever we are in a capital situation now said mr pickwick looking round him the crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity and they were nearly alone capital echoed both mr snodgrass and mr winkle what are they doing now inquired mr pickwick adjusting his spectacles i ather think said mr winkle changing colour i rather think they re going to fire nonsense said mr pickwick hastily i eally think they are urged mr snodgrass somewhat alarmed impossible replied mr pickwick he had hardly uttered the word when the whole halfozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had but one common object and that object the pickwickians and burst forth with the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth to its centres or an elderly gentleman off his it was in this trying situation exposed to a galling fire of blank cartridges and harassed by the operations of the military a fresh body of whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side that mr pickwick displayed that perfect coolness and selfossession which are the indispensable accompaniments of a great mind he seized mr winkle by the arm and placing himself between that gentleman and mr snodgrass earnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being rendered deaf by the noise there was no immediate danger to be apprehended from the firing but ut uppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges by mistake remonstrated mr winkle pallid at the supposition he was himself conjuring up i heard something whistle through the air now o sharp close to my ear we had better throw ourselves on our faces hadn t we said mr snodgrass no no t s over now said mr pickwick his lip might quiver and his cheek might blanch but no expression of fear or concern escaped the lips of that immortal man mr pickwick was right he firing ceased but he had scarcely time to congratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion when a quick movement was visible in the line the hoarse shout of the word of command ran along it and before either of the party could form a guess at the meaning of this new manoeuvre the whole of the halfozen regiments with fixed bayonets charged at doubleuick time down upon the very spot on which mr pickwick and his friends were stationed man is but mortal and there is a point beyond which human courage cannot extend mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant on the advancing mass and then fairly turned his back and e will not say fled firstly because it is an ignoble term and secondly because mr pickwick s figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat he trotted away at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him so quickly indeed that he did not perceive the awkwardness of his situation to the full extent until too late the opposite troops whose fallingn had perplexed mr pickwick a few seconds before were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham besiegers of the citadel and the consequence was that mr pickwick and his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines of great length the one advancing at a rapid pace and the other firmly waiting the collision in hostile array hoi shouted the officers of the advancing line get out of the way cried the officers of the stationary one where are we to go to screamed the agitated pickwickians hoi oi oi was the only reply there was a moment of intense bewilderment a heavy tramp of footsteps a violent concussion a smothered laugh the halfozen regiments were half a thousand yards off and the soles of mr pickwick s boots were elevated in air mr snodgrass and mr winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset with remarkable agility when the first object that met the eyes of the latter as he sat on the ground staunching with a yellow silk handkerchief the stream of life which issued from his nose was his venerated leader at some distance off running after his own hat which was gambolling playfully away in perspective there are very few moments in a man s existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress or meets with so little charitable commiseration as when he is in pursuit of his own hat a vast deal of coolness and a peculiar degree of judgment are requisite in catching a hat a man must not be precipitate or he runs over it he must not rush into the opposite extreme or he loses it altogether the best way is to keep gently up with the object of pursuit to be wary and cautious to watch your opportunity well get gradually before it then make a rapid dive seize it by the crown and stick it firmly on your head smiling pleasantly all the time as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else there was a fine gentle wind and mr pickwick s hat rolled sportively before it the wind puffed and mr pickwick puffed and the hat rolled over and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide and on it might have rolled far beyond mr pickwick s reach had not its course been providentially stopped just as that gentleman was on the point of resigning it to its fate mr pickwick we say was completely exhausted and about to give up the chase when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel of a carriage which was drawn up in a line with half a dozen other vehicles on the spot to which his steps had been directed mr pickwick perceiving his advantage darted briskly forward secured his property planted it on his head and paused to take breath he had not been stationary half a minute when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced by a voice which he at once recognised as mr tupman s and looking upwards he beheld a sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure in an open barouche the horses of which had been taken out the better to accommodate it to the crowded place stood a stout old gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons corduroy breeches and topoots two young ladies in scarfs and feathers a young gentleman apparently enamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers a lady of doubtful age probably the aunt of the aforesaid and mr tupman as easy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious dimensions ne of those hampers which always awakens in a contemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls tongues and bottles of wine nd on the box sat a fat and redaced boy in a state of somnolency whom no speculative observer could have regarded for an instant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents of the beforeentioned hamper when the proper time for their consumption should arrive mr pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects when he was again greeted by his faithful disciple pickwick ickwick said mr tupman come up here make haste come along sir pray come up said the stout gentleman joe amn that boy he s gone to sleep again oe let down the steps the fat boy rolled slowly off the box let down the steps and held the carriage door invitingly open mr snodgrass and mr winkle came up at the moment room for you all gentlemen said the stout man two inside and one out joe make room for one of these gentlemen on the box now sir come along and the stout gentleman extended his arm and pulled first mr pickwick and then mr snodgrass into the barouche by main force mr winkle mounted to the box the fat boy waddled to the same perch and fell fast asleep instantly well gentlemen said the stout man very glad to see you know you very well gentlemen though you mayn t remember me i spent some ev nin s at your club last winter icked up my friend mr tupman here this morning and very glad i was to see him well sir and how are you you do look uncommon well to be sure mr pickwick acknowledged the compliment and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the topoots well and how are you sir said the stout gentleman addressing mr snodgrass with paternal anxiety charming eh well that s right that s right and how are you sir to mr winkl well i am glad to hear you say you are well very glad i am to be sure my daughters gentlemen y gals these are and that s my sister miss rachael wardle she s a miss she is and yet she ain t a miss h sir eh and the stout gentleman playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of mr pickwick and laughed very heartily lor brother said miss wardle with a deprecating smile true true said the stout gentleman no one can deny it gentlemen i beg your pardon this is my friend mr trundle and now you all know each other let s be comfortable and happy and see what s going forward that s what i say so the stout gentleman put on his spectacles and mr pickwick pulled out his glass and everybody stood up in the carriage and looked over somebody else s shoulder at the evolutions of the military astounding evolutions they were one rank firing over the heads of another rank and then running away and then the other rank firing over the heads of another rank and running away in their turn and then forming squares with officers in the centre and then descending the trench on one side with scalingadders and ascending it on the other again by the same means and knocking down barricades of baskets and behaving in the most gallant manner possible then there was such a ramming down of the contents of enormous guns on the battery with instruments like magnified mops such a preparation before they were let off and such an awful noise when they did go that the air resounded with the screams of ladies the young misses wardle were so frightened that mr trundle was actually obliged to hold one of them up in the carriage while mr snodgrass supported the other and mr wardle s sister suffered under such a dreadful state of nervous alarm that mr tupman found it indispensably necessary to put his arm round her waist to keep her up at all everybody was excited except the fat boy and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby joe joe said the stout gentleman when the citadel was taken and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner damn that boy he s gone to sleep again be good enough to pinch him sir n the leg if you please nothing else wakes him hank you undo the hamper joe the fat boy who had been effectually roused by the compression of a portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of mr winkle rolled off the box once again and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity now we must sit close said the stout gentleman after a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies sleeves and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen s laps the whole party were stowed down in the barouche and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy who had mounted up behind for the purpos into the carriage now joe knives and forks the knives and forks were handed in and the ladies and gentlemen inside and mr winkle on the box were each furnished with those useful instruments plates joe plates a similar process employed in the distribution of the crockery now joe the fowls damn that boy he s gone to sleep again joe joe sundry taps on the head with a stick and the fat boy with some difficulty roused from his lethargy come hand in the eatables there was something in the sound of the last word which roused the unctuous boy he jumped up and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket now make haste said mr wardle for the fat boy was hanging fondly over a capon which he seemed wholly unable to part with the boy sighed deeply and bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness unwillingly consigned it to his master that s right sharp now the tongue ow the pigeon pie take care of that veal and ham ind the lobsters ake the salad out of the cloth ive me the dressing such were the hurried orders which issued from the lips of mr wardle as he handed in the different articles described and placed dishes in everybody s hands and on everybody s knees in endless number now ain t this capital inquired that jolly personage when the work of destruction had commenced capital said mr winkle who was carving a fowl on the box glass of wine with the greatest pleasure you better have a bottle to yourself up there hadn t you you re very good joe yes sir he wasn t asleep this time having just succeeded in abstracting a veal patty bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box glad to see you sir thank mr winkle emptied his glass and placed the bottle on the coachox by his side will you permit me to have the pleasure sir said mr trundle to mr winkle with great pleasure replied mr winkle to mr trundle and then the two gentlemen took wine after which they took a glass of wine round ladies and all how dear emily is flirting with the strange gentleman whispered the spinster aunt with true spinsteruntike envy to her brother mr wardle oh i don t know said the jolly old gentleman all very natural i dare say othing unusual mr pickwick some wine sir mr pickwick who had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeonie readily assented emily my dear said the spinster aunt with a patronising air don t talk so loud love lor aunt aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves i think whispered miss isabella wardle to her sister emily the young ladies laughed very heartily and the old one tried to look amiable but couldn t manage it young girls have such spirits said miss wardle to mr tupman with an air of gentle commiseration as if animal spirits were contraband and their possession without a permit a high crime and misdemeanour oh they have replied mr tupman not exactly making the sort of reply that was expected from him it s quite delightful hem said miss wardle rather dubiously will you permit me said mr tupman in his blandest manner touching the enchanting rachael s wrist with one hand and gently elevating the bottle with the other will you permit me oh sir mr tupman looked most impressive and rachael expressed her fear that more guns were going off in which case of course she should have required support again do you think my dear nieces pretty whispered their affectionate aunt to mr tupman i should if their aunt wasn t here replied the ready pickwickian with a passionate glance oh you naughty man ut really if their complexions were a little better don t you think they would be niceooking girls y candlelight yes i think they would said mr tupman with an air of indifference oh you quiz know what you were going to say what inquired mr tupman who had not precisely made up his mind to say anything at all you were going to say that isabel stoops know you were ou men are such observers well so she does it can t be denied and certainly if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly it is stooping i often tell her that when she gets a little older she be quite frightful well you are a quiz mr tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate so he looked very knowing and smiled mysteriously what a sarcastic smile said the admiring rachael i declare i quite afraid of you afraid of me oh you can t disguise anything from me know what that smile means very well what said mr tupman who had not the slightest notion himself you mean said the amiable aunt sinking her voice still lower you mean that you don t think isabella s stooping is as bad as emily s boldness well she is bold you cannot think how wretched it makes me sometimes sure i cry about it for hours together y dear brother is so good and so unsuspicious that he never sees it if he did i quite certain it would break his heart i wish i could think it was only manner hope it may be here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh and shook her head despondingl i sure aunt s talking about us whispered miss emily wardle to her sister i quite certain of it he looks so malicious is she replied isabella hem aunt dear yes my dear love i so afraid you catch cold aunt ave a silk handkerchief to tie round your dear old head ou really should take care of yourself consider your age however well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been it was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to there is no guessing in what form of reply the aunt s indignation would have vented itself had not mr wardle unconsciously changed the subject by calling emphatically for joe damn that boy said the old gentleman he s gone to sleep again very extraordinary boy that said mr pickwick does he always sleep in this way sleep said the old gentleman he s always asleep goes on errands fast asleep and snores as he waits at table how very odd said mr pickwick ah odd indeed returned the old gentleman i proud of that boy wouldn t part with him on any account e s a natural curiosity here joe oe ake these things away and open another bottle ye hear the fat boy rose opened his eyes swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep and slowly obeyed his master s orders loating languidly over the remains of the feast as he removed the plates and deposited them in the hamper the fresh bottle was produced and speedily emptied the hamper was made fast in its old place he fat boy once more mounted the box he spectacles and pocketlass were again adjusted nd the evolutions of the military recommenced there was a great fizzing and banging of guns and starting of ladies nd then a mine was sprung to the gratification of everybody nd when the mine had gone off the military and the company followed its example and went off too now mind said the old gentleman as he shook hands with mr pickwick at the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at intervals during the conclusion of the proceedings we shall see you all toorrow most certainly replied mr pickwick you have got the address manor farm dingley dell said mr pickwick consulting his pocket book that s it said the old gentleman i don t let you off mind under a week and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing if you ve come down for a country life come to me and i give you plenty of it joe amn that boy he s gone to sleep again oe help tom put in the horses the horses were put in he driver mounted he fat boy clambered up by his side arewells were exchanged nd the carriage rattled off as the pickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it the setting sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers and fell upon the form of the fat boy his head was sunk upon his bosom and he slumbered again chapter a short one howing among other matters how mr pickwick undertook to drive and mr winkle to ride and how they both did it bright and pleasant was the sky balmy the air and beautiful the appearance of every object around as mr pickwick leaned over the balustrades of rochester bridge contemplating nature and waiting for breakfast the scene was indeed one which might well have charmed a far less reflective mind than that to which it was presented on the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall broken in many places and in some overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy masses huge knots of seaweed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones trembling in every breath of wind and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark and ruined battlements behind it rose the ancient castle its towers roofless and its massive walls crumbling away but telling us proudly of its old might and strength as when seven hundred years ago it rang with the clash of arms or resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry on either side the banks of the medway covered with cornfields and pastures with here and there a windmill or a distant church stretched away as far as the eye could see presenting a rich and varied landscape rendered more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across it as the thin and halformed clouds skimmed away in the light of the morning sun the river reflecting the clear blue of the sky glistened and sparkled as it flowed noiselessly on and the oars of the fishermen dipped into the water with a clear and liquid sound as their heavy but picturesque boats glided slowly down the stream mr pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had been led by the objects before him by a deep sigh and a touch on his shoulder he turned round and the dismal man was at his side contemplating the scene inquired the dismal man i was said mr pickwick and congratulating yourself on being up so soon mr pickwick nodded assent ah people need to rise early to see the sun in all his splendour for his brightness seldom lasts the day through the morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike you speak truly sir said mr pickwick how common the saying continued the dismal man the morning s too fine to last how well might it be applied to our everyday existence god what would i forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored or to be able to forget them for ever you have seen much trouble sir said mr pickwick compassionately i have said the dismal man hurriedly i have more than those who see me now would believe possible he paused for an instant and then said abruptly did it ever strike you on such a morning as this that drowning would be happiness and peace god bless me no replied mr pickwick edging a little from the balustrade as the possibility of the dismal man s tipping him over by way of experiment occurred to him rather forcibly i have thought so often said the dismal man without noticing the action the calm cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to repose and rest a bound a splash a brief struggle there is an eddy for an instant it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple the waters have closed above your head and the world has closed upon your miseries and misfortunes for ever the sunken eye of the dismal man flashed brightly as he spoke but the momentary excitement quickly subsided and he turned calmly away as he said there nough of that i wish to see you on another subject you invited me to read that paper the night before last and listened attentively while i did so i did replied mr pickwick and i certainly thought i asked for no opinion said the dismal man interrupting him and i want none you are travelling for amusement and instruction suppose i forward you a curious manuscript bserve not curious because wild or improbable but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life ould you communicate it to the club of which you have spoken so frequently certainly replied mr pickwick if you wished it and it would be entered on their transactions you shall have it replied the dismal man your address and mr pickwick having communicated their probable route the dismal man carefully noted it down in a greasy pocketook and resisting mr pickwick s pressing invitation to breakfast left that gentleman at his inn and walked slowly away mr pickwick found that his three companions had risen and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast which was ready laid in tempting display they sat down to the meal and broiled ham eggs tea coffee and sundries began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare and the appetites of its consumers now about manor farm said mr pickwick how shall we go we had better consult the waiter perhaps said mr tupman and the waiter was summoned accordingly dingley dell gentlemen ifteen miles gentlemen ross road ost chaise sir posthaise won t hold more than two said mr pickwick true sir eg your pardon sir ery nice fourheel chaise sir seat for two behind ne in front for the gentleman that drives h beg your pardon sir hat only hold three what s to be done said mr snodgrass perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride sir suggested the waiter looking towards mr winkle very good saddleorses sir ny of mr wardle s men coming to rochester bring em back sir the very thing said mr pickwick winkle will you go on horseback now mr winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest recesses of his own heart relative to his equestrian skill but as he would not have them even suspected on any account he at once replied with great hardihood certainly i should enjoy it of all things mr winkle had rushed upon his fate there was no resource let them be at the door by eleven said mr pickwick very well sir replied the waiter the waiter retired the breakfast concluded and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms to prepare a change of clothing to take with them on their approaching expedition mr pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements and was looking over the coffeeoom blinds at the passengers in the street when the waiter entered and announced that the chaise was ready n announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed by forthwith appearing before the coffee room blinds aforesaid it was a curious little green box on four wheels with a low place like a winein for two behind and an elevated perch for one in front drawn by an immense brown horse displaying great symmetry of bone an hostler stood near holding by the bridle another immense horse a near relative of the animal in the chaise eady saddled for mr winkle bless my soul said mr pickwick as they stood upon the pavement while the coats were being put in bless my soul who s to drive i never thought of that oh you of course said mr tupman of course said mr snodgrass i exclaimed mr pickwick not the slightest fear sir interposed the hostler warrant him quiet sir a hinfant in arms might drive him he don t shy does he inquired mr pickwick shy sir e wouldn t shy if he was to meet a vaginoad of monkeys with their tails burned off the last recommendation was indisputable mr tupman and mr snodgrass got into the bin mr pickwick ascended to his perch and deposited his feet on a floorlothed shelf erected beneath it for that purpose now shiny villiam said the hostler to the deputy hostler give the gen lm n the ribbons shiny villiam o called probably from his sleek hair and oily countenance laced the reins in mr pickwick s left hand and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right wo cried mr pickwick as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffeeoom window wo echoed mr tupman and mr snodgrass from the bin only his playfulness gen lm n said the head hostler encouragingly jist kitch hold on him villiam the deputy restrained the animal s impetuosity and the principal ran to assist mr winkle in mounting t other side sir if you please blowed if the gen lm n worn t aettin up on the wrong side whispered a grinning postoy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter mr winkle thus instructed climbed into his saddle with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a firstate manfar all right inquired mr pickwick with an inward presentiment that it was all wrong all right replied mr winkle faintly let em go cried the hostler hold him in sir and away went the chaise and the saddleorse with mr pickwick on the box of the one and mr winkle on the back of the other to the delight and gratification of the whole innard what makes him go sideways said mr snodgrass in the bin to mr winkle in the saddle i can t imagine replied mr winkle his horse was drifting up the street in the most mysterious manner ide first with his head towards one side of the way and his tail towards the other mr pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other particular the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the management of the animal attached to the chaise who displayed various peculiarities highly interesting to a bystander but by no means equally amusing to any one seated behind him besides constantly jerking his head up in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for mr pickwick to hold them he had a singular propensity for darting suddenly every now and then to the side of the road then stopping short and then rushing forward for some minutes at a speed which it was wholly impossible to control what can he mean by this said mr snodgrass when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time i don t know replied mr tupman it looks very like shying don t it mr snodgrass was about to reply when he was interrupted by a shout from mr pickwick woo said that gentleman i have dropped my whip winkle said mr snodgrass as the equestrian came trotting up on the tall horse with his hat over his ears and shaking all over as if he would shake to pieces with the violence of the exercise pick up the whip there s a good fellow mr winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall horse till he was black in the face and having at length succeeded in stopping him dismounted handed the whip to mr pickwick and grasping the reins prepared to remount now whether the tall horse in the natural playfulness of his disposition was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with mr winkle or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one are points upon which of course we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion by whatever motives the animal was actuated certain it is that mr winkle had no sooner touched the reins than he slipped them over his head and darted backwards to their full length poor fellow said mr winkle soothingly poor fellow old horse the poor fellow was proof against flattery the more mr winkle tried to get nearer him the more he sidled away and notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling there were mr winkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes at the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first commenced n unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances but particularly so in a lonely road where no assistance can be procured what am i to do shouted mr winkle after the dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time what am i to do i can t get on him you had better lead him till we come to a turnpike replied mr pickwick from the chaise but he won t come roared mr winkle do come and hold him mr pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity he threw the reins on the horse s back and having descended from his seat carefully drew the chaise into the hedge lest anything should come along the road and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion leaving mr tupman and mr snodgrass in the vehicle the horse no sooner beheld mr pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character that it at once drew mr winkle who was still at the end of the bridle at a rather quicker rate than fast walking in the direction from which they had just come mr pickwick ran to his assistance but the faster mr pickwick ran forward the faster the horse ran backward there was a great scraping of feet and kicking up of the dust and at last mr winkle his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets fairly let go his hold the horse paused stared shook his head turned round and quietly trotted home to rochester leaving mr winkle and mr pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay a rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention they looked up bless my soul exclaimed the agonised mr pickwick there s the other horse running away it was but too true the animal was startled by the noise and the reins were on his back the results may be guessed he tore off with the four wheeled chaise behind him and mr tupman and mr snodgrass in the four wheeled chaise the heat was a short one mr tupman threw himself into the hedge mr snodgrass followed his example the horse dashed the four heeled chaise against a wooden bridge separated the wheels from the body and the bin from the perch and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he had made the first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset process which gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury beyond sundry rents in their garments and various lacerations from the brambles the next thing to be done was to unharness the horse this complicated process having been effected the party walked slowly forward leading the horse among them and abandoning the chaise to its fate an hour s walk brought the travellers to a little roadide public house with two elmrees a horse trough and a signpost in front one or two deformed hayicks behind a kitchen garden at the side and rotten sheds and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all about it a redeaded man was working in the garden and to him mr pickwick called lustily hollo there the redeaded man raised his body shaded his eyes with his hand and stared long and coolly at mr pickwick and his companions hollo there repeated mr pickwick hollo was the redeaded man s reply how far is it to dingley dell better er seven mile is it a good road no tain t having uttered this brief reply and apparently satisfied himself with another scrutiny the redeaded man resumed his work we want to put this horse up here said mr pickwick i suppose we can can t we want to put that ere horse up do repeated the redeaded man leaning on his spade of course replied mr pickwick who had by this time advanced horse in hand to the garden rails missus oared the man with the red head emerging from the garden and looking very hard at the horse missus a tall bony woman traight all the way down n a coarse blue pelisse with the waist an inch or two below her armits responded to the call can we put this horse up here my good woman said mr tupman advancing and speaking in his most seductive tones the woman looked very hard at the whole party and the redeaded man whispered something in her ear no replied the woman after a little consideration i afeerd on it afraid exclaimed mr pickwick what s the woman afraid of it got us in trouble last time said the woman turning into the house i woan t have nothin to say to un most extraordinary thing i have ever met with in my life said the astonished mr pickwick i eally believe whispered mr winkle as his friends gathered round him that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest manner what exclaimed mr pickwick in a storm of indignation mr winkle modestly repeated his suggestion hollo you fellow said the angry mr pickwick do you think we stole the horse i sure ye did replied the redeaded man with a grin which agitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other saying which he turned into the house and banged the door after him it s like a dream ejaculated mr pickwick a hideous dream the idea of a man s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can t get rid of the depressed pickwickians turned moodily away with the tall quadruped for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust following slowly at their heels it was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their fourooted companion turned into the lane leading to manor farm and even when they were so near their place of destination the pleasure they would otherwise have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the singularity of their appearance and the absurdity of their situation torn clothes lacerated faces dusty shoes exhausted looks and above all the horse oh how mr pickwick cursed that horse he had eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of hatred and revenge more than once he had calculated the probable amount of the expense he would incur by cutting his throat and now the temptation to destroy him or to cast him loose upon the world rushed upon his mind with tenfold force he was roused from a meditation on these dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn of the lane it was mr wardle and his faithful attendant the fat boy why where have you been said the hospitable old gentleman i ve been waiting for you all day well you do look tired what scratches not hurt i hope h well i am glad to hear that ery so you ve been spilt eh never mind common accident in these parts joe e s asleep again oe take that horse from the gentlemen and lead it into the stable the fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal and the old gentleman condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the day s adventures as they thought proper to communicate led the way to the kitchen we have you put to rights here said the old gentleman and then i introduce you to the people in the parlour emma bring out the cherry brandy now jane a needle and thread here towels and water mary come girls bustle about three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different articles in requisition while a couple of largeeaded circular visaged males rose from their seats in the chimneyorner for although it was a may evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as if it were christma and dived into some obscure recesses from which they speedily produced a bottle of blacking and some half dozen brushes bustle said the old gentleman again but the admonition was quite unnecessary for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy and another brought in the towels and one of the men suddenly seizing mr pickwick by the leg at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance brushed away at his boot till his corns were redot while the other shampooed mr winkle with a heavy clothesrush indulging during the operation in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse mr snodgrass having concluded his ablutions took a survey of the room while standing with his back to the fire sipping his cherry brandy with heartfelt satisfaction he describes it as a large apartment with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney the ceiling garnished with hams sides of bacon and ropes of onions the walls were decorated with several huntinghips two or three bridles a saddle and an old rusty blunderbuss with an inscription below it intimating that it was loaded s it had been on the same authority for half a century at least an old eightay clock of solemn and sedate demeanour ticked gravely in one corner and a silver watch of equal antiquity dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser ready said the old gentleman inquiringly when his guests had been washed mended brushed and brandied quite replied mr pickwick come along then and the party having traversed several dark passages and being joined by mr tupman who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from emma for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings arrived at the parlour door welcome said their hospitable host throwing it open and stepping forward to announce them welcome gentlemen to manor farm chapter an oldashioned cardarty he clergyman s verses he story of the convict s return several guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet mr pickwick and his friends upon their entrance and during the performance of the ceremony of introduction with all due formalities mr pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance and speculate upon the characters and pursuits of the persons by whom he was surrounded habit in which he in common with many other great men delighted to indulge a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gown o less a personage than mr wardle s mother the post of honour on the rightand corner of the chimneyiece and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk teaettle holders of a more modern period the aunt the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady crowded round her easyhair one holding her earrumpet another an orange and a third a smelling bottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a baldeaded old gentleman with a goodumoured benevolent face he clergyman of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery of manufacturing homeade cordials greatly to other people s satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hardeaded ripstone pippinaced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner and two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and his fellowoyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice ah said the old lady shaking her head i can t hear you mr pickwick grandma screamed both the young ladies together ah exclaimed the old lady well it don t much matter he don t care for an old like me i dare say i assure you ma am said mr pickwick grasping the old lady s hand and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance i assure you ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well ah said the old lady after a short pause it s all very fine i dare say but i can t hear him grandma s rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone but she talk to you presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle delightful situation this said mr pickwick delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle well i think it is said mr wardle there ain t a better spot o ground in all kent sir said the hard headed man with the pippin ace there ain t indeed sir sure there ain t sir the hardeaded man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very much contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last there ain t a better spot o ground in all kent said the hardeaded man again after a pause cept mullins s meadows observed the fat man solemnly mullins s meadows ejaculated the other with profound contempt ah mullins s meadows repeated the fat man reg lar good land that interposed another fat man and so it is surey said a third fat man everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hardeaded man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more what are they talking about inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice for like many deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself about the land grandma what about the land othing the matter is there no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins s meadows how should he know anything about it inquired the old lady indignantly miller s a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saying which the old lady quite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carvingnives at the hard headed delinquent come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversation what say you to a rubber mr pickwick i should like it of all things replied that gentleman but pray don t make up one on my account oh i assure you mother s very fond of a rubber said mr wardle ain t you mother the old lady who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other replied in the affirmative joe joe said the gentleman joe amn that h here he is put out the cardables the lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out two cardables the one for pope joan and the other for whist the whistlayers were mr pickwick and the old lady mr miller and the fat gentleman the round game comprised the rest of the company the rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and sedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled whist solemn observance to which as it appears to us the title of game has been very irreverently and ignominiously applied the roundame table on the other hand was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of mr miller who not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent and called forth the goodumour of the old lady in a proportionate degree there said the criminal miller triumphantly as he took up the odd trick at the conclusion of a hand that could not have been played better i flatter myself impossible to have made another trick miller ought to have trumped the diamond oughtn t he sir said the old lady mr pickwick nodded assent ought i though said the unfortunate with a doubtful appeal to his partner you ought sir said the fat gentleman in an awful voice very sorry said the crestfallen miller much use that growled the fat gentleman two by honours akes us eight said mr pickwick another hand can you one inquired the old lady i can replied mr pickwick double single and the rub never was such luck said mr miller never was such cards said the fat gentleman a solemn silence mr pickwick humorous the old lady serious the fat gentleman captious and mr miller timorous another double said the old lady triumphantly making a memorandum of the circumstance by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under the candlestick a double sir said mr pickwick quite aware of the fact sir replied the fat gentleman sharply another game with a similar result was followed by a revoke from the unlucky miller on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game when he retired into a corner and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twentyeven minutes at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement and offered mr pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a christian forgiveness of injuries sustained the old lady s hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky miller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentryox meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily isabella wardle and mr trundle went partners and emily wardle and mr snodgrass did the same and even mr tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint stock company of fish and flattery old mr wardle was in the very height of his jollity and he was so funny in his management of the board and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings that the whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter there was one old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for at which everybody laughed regularly every round and when the old lady looked cross at having to pay they laughed louder than ever on which the old lady s face gradually brightened up till at last she laughed louder than any of them then when the spinster aunt got matrimony the young ladies laughed afresh and the spinster aunt seemed disposed to be pettish till feeling mr tupman squeezing her hand under the table she brightened up too and looked rather knowing as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for whereupon everybody laughed again and especially old mr wardle who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest as to mr snodgrass he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner s ear which made one old gentleman facetiously sly about partnerships at cards and partnerships for life and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon accompanied with divers winks and chuckles which made the company very merry and the old gentleman s wife especially so and mr winkle came out with jokes which are very well known in town but are not all known in the country and as everybody laughed at them very heartily and said they were very capital mr winkle was in a state of great honour and glory and the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on for the happy faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too and though the merriment was rather boisterous still it came from the heart and not from the lips and this is the right sort of merriment after all the evening glided swiftly away in these cheerful recreations and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched and the little party formed a social circle round the fire mr pickwick thought he had never felt so happy in his life and at no time so much disposed to enjoy and make the most of the passing moment now this said the hospitable host who was sitting in great state next the old lady s armhair with her hand fast clasped in his this is just what i like he happiest moments of my life have been passed at this old fireside and i am so attached to it that i keep up a blazing fire here every evening until it actually grows too hot to bear it why my poor old mother here used to sit before this fireplace upon that little stool when she was a girl didn t you mother the tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled stole down the old lady s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile you must excuse my talking about this old place mr pickwick resumed the host after a short pause for i love it dearly and know no other he old houses and fields seem like living friends to me and so does our little church with the ivy about which by the bye our excellent friend there made a song when he first came amongst us mr snodgrass have you anything in your glass plenty thank you replied that gentleman whose poetic curiosity had been greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer i beg your pardon but you were talking about the song of the ivy you must ask our friend opposite about that said the host knowingly indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head may i say that i should like to hear you repeat it sir said mr snodgrass why really replied the clergyman it s a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time such as it is however you shall hear it if you wish a murmur of curiosity was of course the reply and the old gentleman proceeded to recite with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife the lines in question i call them said he the ivy green oh a dainty plant is the ivy green that creepeth o er ruins old of right choice food are his meals i ween in his cell so lone and cold the wall must be crumbled the stone decayed to pleasure his dainty whim and the mouldering dust that years have made is a merry meal for him creeping where no life is seen a rare old plant is the ivy green fast he stealeth on though he wears no wings and a staunch old heart has he how closely he twineth how tight he clings to his friend the huge oak tree and slily he traileth along the ground and his leaves he gently waves as he joyously hugs and crawleth round the rich mould of dead men s graves creeping where grim death has been a rare old plant is the ivy green whole ages have fled and their works decayed and nations have scattered been but the stout old ivy shall never fade from its hale and hearty green the brave old plant in its lonely days shall fatten upon the past for the stateliest building man can raise is the ivy s food at last creeping on where time has been a rare old plant is the ivy green while the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time to enable mr snodgrass to note them down mr pickwick perused the lineaments of his face with an expression of great interest the old gentleman having concluded his dictation and mr snodgrass having returned his noteook to his pocket mr pickwick said excuse me sir for making the remark on so short an acquaintance but a gentleman like yourself cannot fail i should think to have observed many scenes and incidents worth recording in the course of your experience as a minister of the gospel i have witnessed some certainly replied the old gentleman but the incidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature my sphere of action being so very limited you did make some notes i think about john edmunds did you not inquired mr wardle who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out for the edification of his new visitors the old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent and was proceeding to change the subject when mr pickwick said i beg your pardon sir but pray if i may venture to inquire who was john edmunds the very thing i was about to ask said mr snodgrass eagerly you are fairly in for it said the jolly host you must satisfy the curiosity of these gentlemen sooner or later so you had better take advantage of this favourable opportunity and do so at once the old gentleman smiled goodumouredly as he drew his chair forward the remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together especially mr tupman and the spinster aunt who were possibly rather hard of hearing and the old lady s earrumpet having been duly adjusted and mr miller who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verse roused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch administered beneath the table by his exartner the solemn fat man the old gentleman without further preface commenced the following tale to which we have taken the liberty of prefixing the title of the convict s return when i first settled in this village said the old gentleman which is now just fivendwenty years ago the most notorious person among my parishioners was a man of the name of edmunds who leased a small farm near this spot he was a morose savageearted bad man idle and dissolute in his habits cruel and ferocious in his disposition beyond the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time in the fields or sotted in the aleouse he had not a single friend or acquaintance no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared and every one detested nd edmunds was shunned by all this man had a wife and one son who when i first came here was about twelve years old of the acuteness of that woman s sufferings of the gentle and enduring manner in which she bore them of the agony of solicitude with which she reared that boy no one can form an adequate conception heaven forgive me the supposition if it be an uncharitable one but i do firmly and in my soul believe that the man systematically tried for many years to break her heart but she bore it all for her child s sake and however strange it may seem to many for his father s too for brute as he was and cruelly as he had treated her she had loved him once and the recollection of what he had been to her awakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom to which all god s creatures but women are strangers they were poor hey could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses but the woman s unceasing and unwearied exertions early and late morning noon and night kept them above actual want these exertions were but ill repaid people who passed the spot in the evening ometimes at a late hour of the night eported that they had heard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress and the sound of blows and more than once when it was past midnight the boy knocked softly at the door of a neighbour s house whither he had been sent to escape the drunken fury of his unnatural father during the whole of this time and when the poor creature often bore about her marks of illsage and violence which she could not wholly conceal she was a constant attendant at our little church regularly every sunday morning and afternoon she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side and though they were both poorly dressed uch more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station hey were always neat and clean every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for poor mrs edmunds and sometimes when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elmrees which leads to the church porch or lingered behind to gaze with a mother s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy as he sported before her with some little companions her careworn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude and she would look if not cheerful and happy at least tranquil and contented five or six years passed away the boy had become a robust and well grown youth the time that had strengthened the child s slight frame and knit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother s form and enfeebled her steps but the arm that should have supported her was no longer locked in hers the face that should have cheered her no more looked upon her own she occupied her old seat but there was a vacant one beside her the bible was kept as carefully as ever the places were found and folded down as they used to be but there was no one to read it with her and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book and blotted the words from her eyes neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old but she shunned their greetings with averted head there was no lingering among the old elmrees now o cheering anticipations of happiness yet in store the desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her face and walked hurriedly away shall i tell you that the young man who looking back to the earliest of his childhood s days to which memory and consciousness extended and carrying his recollection down to that moment could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake with illsage and insult and violence and all endured for him hall i tell you that he with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart and a sullen wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men and was madly pursuing a headlong career which must bring death to him and shame to her alas for human nature you have anticipated it long since the measure of the unhappy woman s misery and misfortune was about to be completed numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood the perpetrators remained undiscovered and their boldness increased a robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit and a strictness of search they had not calculated on young edmunds was suspected with three companions he was apprehended committed ried ondemned o die the wild and piercing shriek from a woman s voice which resounded through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced rings in my ears at this moment that cry struck a terror to the culprit s heart which trial condemnation he approach of death itself had failed to awaken the lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness throughout quivered and parted involuntarily the face turned ashy pale as the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore the sturdy limbs of the felon trembled and he staggered in the dock in the first transports of her mental anguish the suffering mother threw herself on her knees at my feet and fervently sought the almighty being who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a world of woe and misery and to spare the life of her only child a burst of grief and a violent struggle such as i hope i may never have to witness again succeeded i knew that her heart was breaking from that hour but i never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips it was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prisonard from day to day eagerly and fervently attempting by affection and entreaty to soften the hard heart of her obdurate son it was in vain he remained moody obstinate and unmoved not even the unlookedor commutation of his sentence to transportation for fourteen years softened for an instant the sullen hardihood of his demeanour but the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity she fell sick she dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once more but her strength failed her and she sank powerless on the ground and now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were tested indeed and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly drove him mad a day passed away and his mother was not there another flew by and she came not near him a third evening arrived and yet he had not seen her and in fourndwenty hours he was to be separated from her perhaps for ever oh how the longorgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard s if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying nd how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him when he heard the truth his mother the only parent he had ever known lay ill t might be dying ithin one mile of the ground he stood on were he free and unfettered a few minutes would place him by her side he rushed to the gate and grasping the iron rails with the energy of desperation shook it till it rang again and threw himself against the thick wall as if to force a passage through the stone but the strong building mocked his feeble efforts and he beat his hands together and wept like a child i bore the mother s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison and i carried the solemn assurance of repentance and his fervent supplication for pardon to her sicked i heard with pity and compassion the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned but i knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination his mother would be no longer of this world he was removed by night a few weeks afterwards the poor woman s soul took its flight i confidently hope and solemnly believe to a place of eternal happiness and rest i performed the burial service over her remains she lies in our little churchyard there is no stone at her grave s head her sorrows were known to man her virtues to god it had been arranged previously to the convict s departure that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission and that the letter should be addressed to me the father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died many years passed over without any intelligence of him and when more than half his term of transportation had expired and i had received no letter i concluded him to be dead as indeed i almost hoped he might be edmunds however had been sent a considerable distance up the country on his arrival at the settlement and to this circumstance perhaps may be attributed the fact that though several letters were despatched none of them ever reached my hands he remained in the same place during the whole fourteen years at the expiration of the term steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother he made his way back to england amidst innumerable difficulties and returned on foot to his native place on a fine sunday evening in the month of august john edmunds set foot in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before his nearest way lay through the churchyard the man s heart swelled as he crossed the stile the tall old elms through whose branches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady part awakened the associations of his earliest days he pictured himself as he was then clinging to his mother s hand and walking peacefully to church he remembered how he used to look up into her pale face and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features ears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him and made him weep too although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were he thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow looking back ever and again to catch his mother s smile or hear her gentle voice and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory and words of kindness unrequited and warnings despised and promises broken thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him and he could bear it no longer he entered the church the evening service was concluded and the congregation had dispersed but it was not yet closed his steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound and he almost feared to be alone it was so still and quiet he looked round him nothing was changed the place seemed smaller than it used to be but there were the old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times the little pulpit with its faded cushion the communion table before which he had so often repeated the commandments he had reverenced as a child and forgotten as a man he approached the old seat it looked cold and desolate the cushion had been removed and the bible was not there perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone he dared not think of what he feared a cold feeling crept over him and he trembled violently as he turned away an old man entered the porch just as he reached it edmunds started back for he knew him well many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard what would he say to the returned convict the old man raised his eyes to the stranger s face bade him good evening and walked slowly on he had forgotten him he walked down the hill and through the village the weather was warm and the people were sitting at their doors or strolling in their little gardens as he passed enjoying the serenity of the evening and their rest from labour many a look was turned towards him and many a doubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him there were strange faces in almost every house in some he recognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow boy when he last saw him urrounded by a troop of merry children in others he saw seated in an easyhair at a cottage door a feeble and infirm old man whom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer but they had all forgotten him and he passed on unknown the last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees as he stood before the old house he home of his infancy o which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow the paling was low though he well remembered the time that it had seemed a high wall to him and he looked over into the old garden there were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be but there were the old trees still he very tree under which he had lain a thousand times when tired of playing in the sun and felt the soft mild sleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him there were voices within the house he listened but they fell strangely upon his ear he knew them not they were merry too and he well knew that his poor old mother could not be cheerful and he away the door opened and a group of little children bounded out shouting and romping the father with a little boy in his arms appeared at the door and they crowded round him clapping their tiny hands and dragging him out to join their joyous sports the convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from his father s sight in that very place he remembered how often he had buried his trembling head beneath the bedclothes and heard the harsh word and the hard stripe and his mother s wailing and though the man sobbed aloud with agony of mind as he left the spot his fist was clenched and his teeth were set in a fierce and deadly passion and such was the return to which he had looked through the weary perspective of many years and for which he had undergone so much suffering no face of welcome no look of forgiveness no house to receive no hand to help him nd this too in the old village what was his loneliness in the wild thick woods where man was never seen to this he felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy he had thought of his native place as it was when he left it and not as it would be when he returned the sad reality struck coldly at his heart and his spirit sank within him he had not courage to make inquiries or to present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with kindness and compassion he walked slowly on and shunning the roadside like a guilty man turned into a meadow he well remembered and covering his face with his hands threw himself upon the grass he had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the newomer and edmunds raised his head the man had moved into a sitting posture his body was much bent and his face was wrinkled and yellow his dress denoted him an inmate of the workhouse he had the appearance of being very old but it looked more the effect of dissipation or disease than the length of years he was staring hard at the stranger and though his eyes were lustreless and heavy at first they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time until they seemed to be starting from their sockets edmunds gradually raised himself to his knees and looked more and more earnestly on the old man s face they gazed upon each other in silence the old man was ghastly pale he shuddered and tottered to his feet edmunds sprang to his he stepped back a pace or two edmunds advanced let me hear you speak said the convict in a thick broken voice stand off cried the old man with a dreadful oath the convict drew closer to him stand off shrieked the old man furious with terror he raised his stick and struck edmunds a heavy blow across the face father evil murmured the convict between his set teeth he rushed wildly forward and clenched the old man by the throat ut he was his father and his arm fell powerless by his side the old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit his face turned black the gore rushed from his mouth and nose and dyed the grass a deep dark red as he staggered and fell he had ruptured a bloodessel and he was a dead man before his son could raise him in that corner of the churchyard said the old gentleman after a silence of a few moments in that corner of the churchyard of which i have before spoken there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event and who was truly contrite penitent and humbled if ever man was no one save myself knew in that man s lifetime who he was or whence he came t was john edmunds the returned convict chapter how mr winkle instead of shooting at the pigeon and killing the crow shot at the crow and wounded the pigeon how the dingley dell cricket club played alluggleton and how alluggleton dined at the dingley dell expense with other interesting and instructive matters the fatiguing adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the clergyman s tale operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of mr pickwick that in less than five minutes after he had been shown to his comfortable bedroom he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep from which he was only awakened by the morning sun darting his bright beams reproachfully into the apartment mr pickwick was no sluggard and he sprang like an ardent warrior from his tentedstead pleasant pleasant country sighed the enthusiastic gentleman as he opened his lattice window who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the chimneyots nothing redolent of pan but paniles no crop but stone crop who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot who i ask could endure it and having crossxamined solitude after the most approved precedents at considerable length mr pickwick thrust his head out of the lattice and looked around him the rich sweet smell of the hayicks rose to his chamber window the hundred perfumes of the little flowerarden beneath scented the air around the deepreen meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air and the birds sang as if every sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration mr pickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie hollo was the sound that roused him he looked to the right but he saw nobody his eyes wandered to the left and pierced the prospect he stared into the sky but he wasn t wanted there and then he did what a common mind would have done at once into the garden and there saw mr wardle how are you said the goodumoured individual out of breath with his own anticipations of pleasure beautiful morning ain t it glad to see you up so early make haste down and come out i wait for you here mr pickwick needed no second invitation ten minutes sufficed for the completion of his toilet and at the expiration of that time he was by the old gentleman s side hollo said mr pickwick in his turn seeing that his companion was armed with a gun and that another lay ready on the grass what s going forward why your friend and i replied the host are going out rookhooting before breakfast he s a very good shot ain t he i ve heard him say he s a capital one replied mr pickwick but i never saw him aim at anything well said the host i wish he come joe oe the fat boy who under the exciting influence of the morning did not appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep emerged from the house go up and call the gentleman and tell him he find me and mr pickwick in the rookery show the gentleman the way there ye hear the boy departed to execute his commission and the host carrying both guns like a second robinson crusoe led the way from the garden this is the place said the old gentleman pausing after a few minutes walking in an avenue of trees the information was unnecessary for the incessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their whereabouts the old gentleman laid one gun on the ground and loaded the other here they are said mr pickwick and as he spoke the forms of mr tupman mr snodgrass and mr winkle appeared in the distance the fat boy not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call had with peculiar sagacity and to prevent the possibility of any mistake called them all come along shouted the old gentleman addressing mr winkle a keen hand like you ought to have been up long ago even to such poor work as this mr winkle responded with a forced smile and took up the spare gun with an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook impressed with a foreboding of his approaching death by violence may be supposed to assume it might have been keenness but it looked remarkably like misery the old gentleman nodded and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to the spot under the direction of the infant lambert forthwith commenced climbing up two of the trees what are these lads for inquired mr pickwick abruptly he was rather alarmed for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the agricultural interest about which he had often heard a great deal might have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a precarious and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for inexperienced sportsmen only to start the game replied mr wardle laughing to what inquired mr pickwick why in plain english to frighten the rooks oh is that all you are satisfied quite very well shall i begin if you please said mr winkle glad of any respite stand aside then now for it the boy shouted and shook a branch with a nest on it half a dozen young rooks in violent conversation flew out to ask what the matter was the old gentleman fired by way of reply down fell one bird and off flew the others take him up joe said the old gentleman there was a smile upon the youth s face as he advanced indistinct visions of rookie floated through his imagination he laughed as he retired with the bird t was a plump one now mr winkle said the host reloading his own gun fire away mr winkle advanced and levelled his gun mr pickwick and his friends cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks which they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of their friend there was a solemn pause shout flapping of wings faint click hollo said the old gentleman won t it go inquired mr pickwick missed fire said mr winkle who was very pale robably from disappointment odd said the old gentleman taking the gun never knew one of them miss fire before why i don t see anything of the cap bless my soul said mr winkle i declare i forgot the cap the slight omission was rectified mr pickwick crouched again mr winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution and mr tupman looked out from behind a tree the boy shouted four birds flew out mr winkle fired there was a scream as of an individual ot a rook n corporal anguish mr tupman had saved the lives of innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm to describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible to tell how mr pickwick in the first transports of emotion called mr winkle wretch how mr tupman lay prostrate on the ground and how mr winkle knelt horrortricken beside him how mr tupman called distractedly upon some feminine christian name and then opened first one eye and then the other and then fell back and shut them both this would be as difficult to describe in detail as it would be to depict the gradual recovering of the unfortunate individual the binding up of his arm with pocketandkerchiefs and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported by the arms of his anxious friends they drew near the house the ladies were at the garden gate waiting for their arrival and their breakfast the spinster aunt appeared she smiled and beckoned them to walk quicker twas evident she knew not of the disaster poor thing there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed they approached nearer why what is the matter with the little old gentleman said isabella wardle the spinster aunt heeded not the remark she thought it applied to mr pickwick in her eyes tracy tupman was a youth she viewed his years through a diminishing glass don t be frightened called out the old host fearful of alarming his daughters the little party had crowded so completely round mr tupman that they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident don t be frightened said the host what s the matter screamed the ladies mr tupman has met with a little accident that s all the spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream burst into an hysteric laugh and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces throw some cold water over her said the old gentleman no no murmured the spinster aunt i am better now bella emily surgeon is he wounded s he dead s he a ha ha here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two of hysteric laughter interspersed with screams calm yourself said mr tupman affected almost to tears by this expression of sympathy with his sufferings dear dear madam calm yourself it is his voice exclaimed the spinster aunt and strong symptoms of fit number three developed themselves forthwith do not agitate yourself i entreat you dearest madam said mr tupman soothingly i am very little hurt i assure you then you are not dead ejaculated the hysterical lady oh say you are not dead don t be a fool rachael interposed mr wardle rather more roughly than was consistent with the poetic nature of the scene what the devil s the use of his saying he isn t dead no no i am not said mr tupman i require no assistance but yours let me lean on your arm he added in a whisper oh miss rachael the agitated female advanced and offered her arm they turned into the breakfast parlour mr tracy tupman gently pressed her hand to his lips and sank upon the sofa are you faint inquired the anxious rachael no said mr tupman it is nothing i shall be better presently he closed his eyes he sleeps murmured the spinster aunt his organs of vision had been closed nearly twenty seconds dear ear r tupman mr tupman jumped up oh say those words again he exclaimed the lady started surely you did not hear them she said bashfully oh yes i did replied mr tupman repeat them if you would have me recover repeat them hush said the lady my brother mr tracy tupman resumed his former position and mr wardle accompanied by a surgeon entered the room the arm was examined the wound dressed and pronounced to be a very slight one and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied they proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an expression of cheerfulness was again restored mr pickwick alone was silent and reserved doubt and distrust were exhibited in his countenance his confidence in mr winkle had been shaken reatly shaken y the proceedings of the morning are you a cricketer inquired mr wardle of the marksman at any other time mr winkle would have replied in the affirmative he felt the delicacy of his situation and modestly replied no are you sir inquired mr snodgrass i was once upon a time replied the host but i have given it up now i subscribe to the club here but i don t play the grand match is played toay i believe said mr pickwick it is replied the host of course you would like to see it i sir replied mr pickwick am delighted to view any sports which may be safely indulged in and in which the impotent effects of unskilful people do not endanger human life mr pickwick paused and looked steadily on mr winkle who quailed beneath his leader s searching glance the great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes and added shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies you cannot leave me in better hands said mr tupman quite impossible said mr snodgrass it was therefore settled that mr tupman should be left at home in charge of the females and that the remainder of the guests under the guidance of mr wardle should proceed to the spot where was to be held that trial of skill which had roused all muggleton from its torpor and inoculated dingley dell with a fever of excitement as their walk which was not above two miles long lay through shady lanes and sequestered footpaths and as their conversation turned upon the delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded mr pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used when he found himself in the main street of the town of muggleton everybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well that muggleton is a corporate town with a mayor burgesses and freemen and anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the freemen or the freemen to the mayor or both to the corporation or all three to parliament will learn from thence what they ought to have known before that muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough mingling a zealous advocacy of christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial rights in demonstration whereof the mayor corporation and other inhabitants have presented at divers times no fewer than one thousand four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of negro slavery abroad and an equal number against any interference with the factory system at home sixtyight in favour of the sale of livings in the church and eightyix for abolishing sunday trading in the street mr pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town and gazed with an air of curiosity not unmixed with interest on the objects around him there was an open square for the marketlace and in the centre of it a large inn with a signost in front displaying an object very common in art but rarely met with in nature o wit a blue lion with three bow legs in the air balancing himself on the extreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot there were within sight an auctioneer s and firegency office a cornactor s a linen draper s a saddler s a distiller s a grocer s and a shoehop he lastentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats bonnets wearing apparel cotton umbrellas and useful knowledge there was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney and there was moreover another red brick house with venetian blinds and a large brass doorlate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon a few boys were making their way to the cricketield and two or three shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like to be making their way to the same spot as indeed to all appearance they might have done without losing any great amount of custom thereby mr pickwick having paused to make these observations to be noted down at a more convenient period hastened to rejoin his friends who had turned out of the main street and were already within sight of the field of battle the wickets were pitched and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties the game had not yet commenced two or three dingley dellers and alluggletonians were amusing themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly from hand to hand and several other gentlemen dressed like them in straw hats flannel jackets and white trousers costume in which they looked very much like amateur stoneasons ere sprinkled about the tents towards one of which mr wardle conducted the party several dozen of howreou s hailed the old gentleman s arrival and a general raising of the straw hats and bending forward of the flannel jackets followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen from london who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of the day with which he had no doubt they would be greatly delighted you had better step into the marquee i think sir said one very stout gentleman whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of flannel elevated on a couple of inflated pillowases you find it much pleasanter sir urged another stout gentleman who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid you re very good said mr pickwick this way said the first speaker they notch in here t s the best place in the whole field and the cricketer panting on before preceded them to the tent capital game mart sport ine exercise ery were the words which fell upon mr pickwick s ear as he entered the tent and the first object that met his eyes was his greenoated friend of the rochester coach holding forth to the no small delight and edification of a select circle of the chosen of alluggleton his dress was slightly improved and he wore boots but there was no mistaking him the stranger recognised his friends immediately and darting forward and seizing mr pickwick by the hand dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction this way his way apital fun ots of beer ogsheads rounds of beef ullocks mustard artoads glorious day own with you ake yourself at home lad to see you ery mr pickwick sat down as he was bid and mr winkle and mr snodgrass also complied with the directions of their mysterious friend mr wardle looked on in silent wonder mr wardle friend of mine said mr pickwick friend of yours y dear sir how are you riend of my friend s give me your hand sir nd the stranger grasped mr wardle s hand with all the fervour of a close intimacy of many years and then stepped back a pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face and figure and then shook hands with him again if possible more warmly than before well and how came you here said mr pickwick with a smile in which benevolence struggled with surprise come replied the stranger stopping at crown rown at muggleton met a party lannel jackets hite trousers nchovy sandwiches devilled kidney plendid fellows lorious mr pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger s system of stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he had somehow or other contracted an acquaintance with the all muggletons which he had converted by a process peculiar to himself into that extent of goodellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded his curiosity was therefore satisfied and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing alluggleton had the first innings and the interest became intense when mr dumkins and mr podder two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club walked bat in hand to their respective wickets mr luffey the highest ornament of dingley dell was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable dumkins and mr struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered podder several players were stationed to look out in different parts of the field and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee and stooping very much as if he were making a back for some beginner at leaprog all the regular players do this sort of thing indeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position the umpires were stationed behind the wickets the scorers were prepared to notch the runs a breathless silence ensued mr luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive podder and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of luffey play suddenly cried the bowler the ball flew from his hand straight and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket the wary dumkins was on the alert it fell upon the tip of the bat and bounded far away over the heads of the scouts who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over them run un nother ow then throw her up p with her top there another o es o hrow her up throw her up uch were the shouts which followed the stroke and at the conclusion of which alluggleton had scored two nor was podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and muggleton he blocked the doubtful balls missed the bad ones took the good ones and sent them flying to all parts of the field the scouts were hot and tired the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached but dumkins and podder remained unconquered did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the ball it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers did a slim gentleman try to catch it it struck him on the nose and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence while the slim gentleman s eyes filled with water and his form writhed with anguish was it thrown straight up to the wicket dumkins had reached it before the ball in short when dumkins was caught out and podder stumped out all muggleton had notched some fiftyour while the score of the dingley dellers was as blank as their faces the advantage was too great to be recovered in vain did the eager luffey and the enthusiastic struggles do all that skill and experience could suggest to regain the ground dingley dell had lost in the contest t was of no avail and in an early period of the winning game dingley dell gave in and allowed the superior prowess of alluggleton the stranger meanwhile had been eating drinking and talking without cessation at every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned while at every bad attempt at a catch and every failure to stop the ball he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in such denunciations as ah ah tupid now butteringers muff humbug nd so forth jaculations which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around as a most excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble game of cricket capital game ell played ome strokes admirable said the stranger as both sides crowded into the tent at the conclusion of the game you have played it sir inquired mr wardle who had been much amused by his loquacity played it think i have housands of times ot here est indies exciting thing ot work ery it must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate observed mr pickwick warm ed hot

ied sir here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents we cannot distinctly affirm we only know that he paused suddenly drew a long and deep breath and looked anxiously on as two of the principal members of the dingley dell club approached mr pickwick and said we are about to partake of a plain dinner at the blue lion sir we hope you and your friends will join us of course said mr wardle among our friends we include mr and he looked towards the stranger jingle said that versatile gentleman taking the hint at once jingle lfred jingle esq of no hall nowhere i shall be very happy i am sure said mr pickwick so shall i said mr alfred jingle drawing one arm through mr pickwick s and another through mr wardle s as he whispered confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman devilish good dinner old but capital into the room this morning owls and pies and all that sort of thing leasant fellows these ell behaved too ery there being no further preliminaries to arrange the company straggled into the town in little knots of twos and threes and within a quarter of an hour were all seated in the great room of the blue lion inn muggleton r dumkins acting as chairman and mr luffey officiating as vice there was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks and plates a great running about of three ponderouseaded waiters and a rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table to each and every of which item of confusion the facetious mr jingle lent the aid of halfozen ordinary men at least when everybody had eaten as much as possible the cloth was removed bottles glasses and dessert were placed on the table and the waiters withdrew to clear away or in other words to appropriate to their own private use and emolument whatever remnants of the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to lay their hands on amidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued there was a little man with a puffy sayothingoe r sort of countenance who remained very quiet occasionally looking round him when the conversation slackened as if he contemplated putting in something very weighty and now and then bursting into a short cough of inexpressible grandeur at length during a moment of comparative silence the little man called out in a very loud solemn voice mr luffey everybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual addressed replied sir i wish to address a few words to you sir if you will entreat the gentlemen to fill their glasses mr jingle uttered a patronising hear hear which was responded to by the remainder of the company and the glasses having been filled the viceresident assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound attention and said mr staple sir said the little man rising i wish to address what i have to say to you and not to our worthy chairman because our worthy chairman is in some measure may say in a great degree he subject of what i have to say or i may say to o state suggested mr jingle yes to state said the little man i thank my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so four hears and one certainly from mr jingl for the suggestion sir i am a deller dingley deller cheer i cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of muggleton nor sir i will frankly admit do i covet that honour and i will tell you why sir hea to muggleton i will readily concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim hey are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me but sir while we remember that muggleton has given birth to a dumkins and a podder let us never forget that dingley dell can boast a luffey and a struggles vociferous cheering let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen sir i envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion cheers every gentleman who hears me is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual who o use an ordinary figure of speech hung out in a tub to the emperor alexander if i were not diogenes said he i would be alexander i can well imagine these gentlemen to say if i were not dumkins i would be luffey if i were not podder i would be struggles enthusiasm but gentlemen of muggleton is it in cricket alone that your fellowownsmen stand pre eminent have you never heard of dumkins and determination have you never been taught to associate podder with property great applause have you never when struggling for your rights your liberties and your privileges been reduced if only for an instant to misgiving and despair and when you have been thus depressed has not the name of dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired great cheering gentlemen i beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of dumkins and podder here the little man ceased and here the company commenced a raising of voices and thumping of tables which lasted with little intermission during the remainder of the evening other toasts were drunk mr luffey and mr struggles mr pickwick and mr jingle were each in his turn the subject of unqualified eulogium and each in due course returned thanks for the honour enthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted ourselves we should have felt a sensation of pride which we cannot express and a consciousness of having done something to merit immortality of which we are now deprived could we have laid the faintest outline on these addresses before our ardent readers mr snodgrass as usual took a great mass of notes which would no doubt have afforded most useful and valuable information had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman s hand so extremely unsteady as to render his writing nearly unintelligible and his style wholly so by dint of patient investigation we have been enabled to trace some characters bearing a faint resemblance to the names of the speakers and we can only discern an entry of a song supposed to have been sung by mr jingl in which the words bowl sparkling ruby bright and wine are frequently repeated at short intervals we fancy too that we can discern at the very end of the notes some indistinct reference to broiled bones and then the words cold without occur but as any hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give rise we will therefore return to mr tupman merely adding that within some few minutes before twelve o clock that night the convocation of worthies of dingley dell and muggleton were heard to sing with great feeling and emphasis the beautiful and pathetic national air of we won t go home till morning we won t go home till morning we won t go home till morning till daylight doth appear chapter strongly illustrative of the position that the course of true love is not a railway the quiet seclusion of dingley dell the presence of so many of the gentler sex and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf were all favourable to the growth and development of those softer feelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of mr tracy tupman and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object the young ladies were pretty their manners winning their dispositions unexceptionable but there was a dignity in the air a toucheot ishness in the walk a majesty in the eye of the spinster aunt to which at their time of life they could lay no claim which distinguished her from any female on whom mr tupman had ever gazed that there was something kindred in their nature something congenial in their souls something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms was evident her name was the first that rose to mr tupman s lips as he lay wounded on the grass and her hysteric laughter was the first sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the house but had her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would have been equally irrepressible in any case or had it been called forth by a more ardent and passionate feeling which he of all men living could alone awaken these were the doubts which racked his brain as he lay extended on the sofa these were the doubts which he determined should be at once and for ever resolved it was evening isabella and emily had strolled out with mr trundle the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair the snoring of the fat boy penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen the buxom servants were lounging at the side door enjoying the pleasantness of the hour and the delights of a flirtation on first principles with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm and there sat the interesting pair uncared for by all caring for none and dreaming only of themselves there they sat in short like a pair of carefullyolded kid gloves ound up in each other i have forgotten my flowers said the spinster aunt water them now said mr tupman in accents of persuasion you will take cold in the evening air urged the spinster aunt affectionately no no said mr tupman rising it will do me good let me accompany you the lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth was placed and taking his right arm led him to the garden there was a bower at the farther end with honeysuckle jessamine and creeping plants ne of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for the accommodation of spiders the spinster aunt took up a large wateringot which lay in one corner and was about to leave the arbour mr tupman detained her and drew her to a seat beside him miss wardle said he the spinster aunt trembled till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large wateringot shook like an infant s rattle miss wardle said mr tupman you are an angel mr tupman exclaimed rachael blushing as red as the wateringot itself nay said the eloquent pickwickian i know it but too well all women are angels they say murmured the lady playfully then what can you be or to what without presumption can i compare you replied mr tupman where was the woman ever seen who resembled you where else could i hope to find so rare a combination of excellence and beauty where else could i seek to h here mr tupman paused and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy wateringot the lady turned aside her head men are such deceivers she softly whispered they are they are ejaculated mr tupman but not all men there lives at least one being who can never change ne being who would be content to devote his whole existence to your happiness ho lives but in your eyes ho breathes but in your smiles ho bears the heavy burden of life itself only for you could such an individual be found said the lady but he can be found said the ardent mr tupman interposing he is found he is here miss wardle and ere the lady was aware of his intention mr tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet mr tupman rise said rachael never was the valorous reply oh rachael he seized her passive hand and the wateringot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips oh rachael say you love me mr tupman said the spinster aunt with averted head i can hardly speak the words but ut ou are not wholly indifferent to me mr tupman no sooner heard this avowal than he proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions prompted and what for aught we know for we are but little acquainted with such matter people so circumstanced always do he jumped up and throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster aunt imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses which after a due show of struggling and resistance she received so passively that there is no telling how many more mr tupman might have bestowed if the lady had not given a very unaffected start and exclaimed in an affrighted tone mr tupman we are observed e are discovered mr tupman looked round there was the fat boy perfectly motionless with his large circular eyes staring into the arbour but without the slightest expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have referred to astonishment curiosity or any other known passion that agitates the human breast mr tupman gazed on the fat boy and the fat boy stared at him and the longer mr tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boy s countenance the
